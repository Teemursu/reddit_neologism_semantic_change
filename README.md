Using Temporal Word Embeddings to Study Semantic Change in Neologisms
---------

As language changes and words shift in meaning, these developments are in addition reflected in cultural change. In this way, examining linguistic change possibly reveals sig-nificant aspects about the state of our society. In this sense, it may be valuable to examine neologisms (newly coined words or expressions) as a certain phenomenon of language change. More specifically, analyzing the semantic developments — occurring during the early existence of a neologism — could provide us with further insight into cultural shifts.
