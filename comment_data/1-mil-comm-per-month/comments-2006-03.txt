if you look at lot of these changes they are really extracted refinements rather than bloating additions they aim at making things more dry and eliminating workarounds that used to be more clumsy so while the rails api may gain few methods it will actually make the programmer experience using rails more consistent and streamlined the beauty of framework like rails is that you can use it without leveraging its full api go ahead and write your stuff old skool in lines of code and few days later you ll look over that code and you ll slash it down to mere lines using rails method you ve just discovered it lot of fun dhh said somewhere that rails should have been because he doesn see lot of major additions any time soon he wisely pushed higher level functionality like login systems etc into generators plugins engines whatnot to keep the framework uncluttered rails is walking the line between high level convenience and low level flexibility better than any other framework ve ever used

while this is interesting it hardly groundbreaking in this vein people posted in south africa used to do have to come up with strategies to get money outside the country under the law it was illegal to extract money so people used to use strategy which ve heard called offset pricing you go to someone involved in international trade with an office in south africa you make an arrangement with them to pay them an amount of money which you would later withdraw in another country in which they had an offiec and then they manage the transition within their company of course there be margin you need to pay to make it worth their while

reddit has ads where
which brings me to the point that reddit should do source comparison with previous submissions and provide possible duplicate links to the submitter so that they can make their own educated decision on the matter it shouldn be too hard to develop an algorithm to extract the rarest words and store them for matching purposes later

not bad but there almost too many opmls there

searching reddit for the story of mel real programmer currently shows the duplicated post as the fifth hit reddit could probably cut down significantly on the number of accidental duplicates by searching on the title as well as the contents of an optional dup search field then showing the submitter the top results of the search and asking them to confirm or not confirm the submission it not significant extra nuisance in fact it makes things more convenient for conscientious submitters who will usually do one or two searches before they submit anyway
there is no source tex or whatever that why it is the way it is it from when publishers went off and did weird things with what you gave them
if by accidental you mean exactly what they planned on happening not an easy shot but definitely what they planned last rock of the end it was the only thing to try if remember correctly
no that definitely not enough real programmer he was wasn even close enough for me to merit clicking on the link not going to go through every other submission with real and programmer in it really think keyword comparison of the whole document is better solution
this author has obviously not seen the nature show filming monkeys eating fruit that they intentionally allowed to ferment unless the placebo effect holds with monkeys this article is mostly bs the monkeys where wasted and acted wasted alcohol lowers inhibitions this is good some of the time and bad at other times if you are looking for mate it can be good in moderate quantities if you are getting up the nerve to fight someone or to drown your murderous compulsions then it is bad
absolutely search on the body too it would still make sense to add completely optional dup search field allowing the would be submitter can make his her own guesses at some distinctive terms from the submitted article

well if you begin submitting links to his blog posts then two things would happen reddit will find out that you like his blog posts and people will find out that they also like his blog and begin posting links so you don have to why don you take the initiative are you afraid of loosing karma
but that different if related question yes btw wasn suggesting that you aren conscientious submitter or that you didn search before submitting we ve both proposed that reddit should do search for possible dupes using some broader criteria than identical urls and display the top search results to the would be submitter before he confirms the submission the new question you ve raised is how should reddit display those search results the reddit search mentioned does pretty well at finding the dup it came in but even if the search had put the dup at you probably still wouldn have picked it up as such from its title so maybe the search results should include some additional information about each hit displayed not just its title and url short list of distinctive words from the hit might indeed be good window into the content the first few words from the body in the manner of gmail google web search might be quite effective too and score submitter and sub date

you re missing one key point if you participate in curling you have to drink it socially unacceptable not to so bowling billiards ice hockey and college drinking games all mixed together of course you drink before and after the game not during but still and as for the shot watched the game and that was the best shot but not by much he nichols was throwing brilliantly and there were few other stunner shots the really cool thing about curling though is that your abilities don degrade nearly as much with age as most other sports lots of year olds are very very solid curlers
granted that shot was amazing and watched it about times but enough to end my mockery of curling think not if curling is going to be an event how about bowling and shuffleboard what about card house making they all seem to take about the same amount of athletic prowess though bowling does seem to have the extra requirement of beer gut

it means that you compare the salaries of women with iq who are scientists not to the general population iq but to women with iq likewise you compare women with iq to women with iq the unstated assumption is that women who are scientists tend to have higher iq so it unfair to compare them to the general population since iq is somewhat proportional to salary one would hope does that help or were you joking

haha guess wasn quite clear was trying to illustrate the differences between being hip and being cool basically things are hip when they are practiced by early adopters and become cool when they transition into practice by everyone else the ipod was hip two years ago now the ipod is cool was saying the fastseduction com community has transitioned from being hip to being cool but you would have to know that strass book was based on that website to understand what was saying guess also the poker reference was to how rounders made poker really popular so that now there are all these kids going around playing poker and watching the world poker tour and stuff

and here why they go terribly with the scheme its very distracting to have along side the comments does slashdot osnews lte or much any other large site have it setup like this nope if you have to keep pictures then we re just going to have to be able to post pictures in the comments to balance it out so what saying is that it would be much better if you made the adds monochrome in your stylesheet and didn use graphical adds maybe you not use picture adds on comment sections that only have few comments on them this is where they re most distracting

few criticisms it to describe successful scientist as doing five year postdoc seven year jr professorship and getting denied tenure at least in my field cognitive psychology the superstars can get prof positions straight out of the phd and most schools have reasonably high rates of granting tenure good but not exceptional candidates can get tenured positions through persistance it not easy but tenure is substantial reward an aside you can be fired with cause prior to being granted tenure but it quite perk to be guaranteed job for life upon gaining tenure sure this varies by discipline region and school but greenspun average trajectory for successful scientist is strawman many scientists do love what they do and the lifestyle associated with academe my grad school advisor spent far more time drinking coffee on the quad watching the undergrad girls go by than any banker know this neglects the opportunity of scientists to leave the ivory tower and head to industry many of my friends are now consultants market researchers data analysts and user research leads these folks make very reasonable money better than folks with bas in the same discipline advanced training in the sciences gives one skills that no undergrad major will offer both technical skills and important experience in public speaking writing and leadership mentorship there have been several posts about the silliness of going through grad school and the poor economic prospects of phd grads there are risks involved and there are certainly more lucrative ways to spend one effort however discipline you love carefully chosen program and advisor and hard work can certainly lead to enjoyable and successful career in science no comment about humanities phd prospects

the comparison with teachers is laughable my wife very smart person has been teaching for years in that time her salary has jumped she now and at the end off her payscale she cannot move up or over any further regardless of how much more experience of schooling she acquires unless she wants to go into administration so she is left with union negotiated pay increases that will amount to parity with inflation or little above in the next years doubt that those will bring her current salary up to there no doubt that scientists are poorly paid when compared against lawyers and business professionals however the comparison to teachers misses the point entirely both professions though vital to society are relegated to low pay because they aren seen as vital neither is consumption driven so in consumer centric economy these professions aren valued

that not true at all research has shown very definite correlation between earnings potential and iq to point the whole thing falls apart at iq and above but before that the relation is staggeringly proportional that the real value of iq it doesn tell us how smart we are it tells us how much on average person with certain mental capability will make in their lifetime which of course we all know has nothing to do with how smart you are so there you have it the true value of iq as tool for analyzing the general population btw no quotes google has plenty on this sure having had to have few such tests myself have heard it time and time again when asking different psychologists what iq is really good for

philip rants on this topic invariably seem to focus on science and engineering careers in academia in typical greenspun fashion he then proceeds to draw conclusions about all science and engineering careers it seems to me if you have the brains to make it through top science engineering degree program and the skill to market yourself to those who need brains you can make killing the paths to big money in the medical and law fields are admittedly more well trodden and clear cut however

nope ve seen that too and then later the same article with slightly different url do well think there larger danger from group think today than from ignoring the wisdom of crowds the stupidity of mobs
maybe the variance in markup could make this really difficult or prone to being labour intensive the only way see how this could be done easily without too much processing would be sloppy hash for the actual text of the files and then collision checking by sloppy hash mean hashing function that allows for lot of collisions for similar data this is used in esr comparator http www catb org esr comparator come to think of it maybe running comparator on tag stripped version of the file would be the solution
yes and that one shot pretty much decided the fate of the gold medal watched the match live and had to marvel the shot even when it meant the we the finnish team would lose the game oh the bitterness
little slow to start but fun fun fun after you get it
esr has written program called comparator http www catb org esr comparator it uses sloppy hash to detect similar lines in source code and flags them so you can refactor copy amp paste code it also lets you use it to flag copywritten code if it copy amp pasted from copywritten sections of code then there you go think this can be used to easily detect large factor of dupes when dupe is found the link can have flag icon see also link or you can hard and fast block the dupe from being reported thoughts concerns
it especially unhelpful when as in this case the bigger problem imho of course seems to have been the use of ejbs rather than design patterns per se

this seemed bit overly negative but with kernel of truth it does ignore the yet another factor that in general women might just night like that kind of work as to the dismal prospects of grads think philip is somewhat affected by his own experience it is definitely possible to make the jump from academia to industry and thereby to land semi stable and okay paying jobs left computer science after master degree and am pretty happy and haven had trouble finding job find his viewpoint bit full of doom and gloom do agree that many women might be smarter about planning for the future and less likely to go into weird directions this fits with the biologically observed trait that males of species tend to have wider spread larger standard deviation in almost all traits mixing up cause and effect to yield pithy aphorism we re expendable so it worth experimenting in the hope of winning big

this imho is ridiculous all it does is creat suspicion for people who dont want to get their dna tested which is the point they dont care about the people who voluntarily give their dna but anyone who refuses they investigate this is serious concern for anyone who doesnt want to get their dna tested in the first place and no matter where its dont in this case voluntarily or court ordered to check in murder investigation because you initially refused you dna is then on record for life longer than life actually those bits will outlive you in any case there are plenty of people out there who want their dna off the record if only for privacy reasons there was similar case here in the states truro mass they wanted to test everyone in the town again on voluntary basis anyone who refused they investigated and never caught the killer all that happen is that aclu came out here to this little rural town with less than year time residents and made big fuss also it didnt add up since the murder had happened in the summertime when the towns population surges from its all pointless and an apparent abuse of technology
there no way this will do as well as the sims no matter how cool or how good it is suspect that big selling point for the sims was the perceived normality of it people who would never have usually played computer game were happy to because it didn feel too weird to them the game however real is probably still to abstract for the mainstream sims playing gamer on the other hand though even if it only does quarter as well as the sims it ll still be smashing success

there nothing fraudulent about it generally although sure exceptions occur these things get stated in at least the amp and usually there is some plain english explanation of this when you buy the argument of what if everyone were to suddenly decide to download at the full rate is weak one virtually every company with large customer base will be incapable of fulfilling their contracts if everyone demands the same thing at the same time on the web we have slashdoting in finance we have bank runs in telecoms we have the new years eve problem the same things happen with air miles insurance companies tech support the list goes on and on you could demand that when you phone tech support there is guaranteed to be person there to receive your call but the only way for the company to achieve this is to employ one tech support person for every product sold and don think you would be happy to pay for the service in the end it is rather pointless exercise attacking either isp or internet users it is just an issue of supply and demand and the most efficient way of distributing finite resources if an isp comes up with way of providing better service for less money and profits accordingly then good for them if they fail to do this ll take my money elsewhere

the wisdom of the crowds apparently only works when there is almost no influencing or getting information from the same source within the crowd everything called mainstream culture today is clearly the opposite and one could argue most website communities have that problem as well

ok so this guy is an academic at mit does he expect us to just believe the figures that he spouts off without some sort of references dont be fooled by this an unreferenced statistic is lie lots of referenced ones are too but we at least get the chance to investigate those this is just rant treat it like any other blog rant his credentials just mean he should know better not sure about you but the smartest guy who sat next to me in undergrad is an assistant prof right now

you know real scientists have been looking into this for years will do it better and more completely than jcraigventer where is celera human genome project now they published one paper and one draft of the genome wouldn tell anyone how they did it the paper shouldn have been published and that was it nothing else ever the public human genome project went on to publish something like more drafts of the human genome getting it better and better yet jcraigventer is still pretending he did it and shit and now he is simply ripping off real scientists ideas etc probably with little credit trying to say he is the first person to think of these novel ideas fuck him he can take his yacht his money and his fucking french poodles and stick it all up his ass

if click on logo that says esperanto reddit it really should not take me to the reddit com main page clicked on it to take me to the esperanto reddit com main page the current behavior makes perfect sense for same language subreddits like programming reddit com and nsfw reddit com but make little to no sense for language based subreddits
isn their minutes of fame up yet
let me revise my stance actually don like any of the logos going back to http reddit com clicking and features reddit want to go to features reddit com clicking on the reddit logo in my reddit com want to go to my reddit com the current functionality is very annoying to me
that just silly first this guy makes confusion between the cost of line of code in his visual basic dirty hacks vs line of code in such complex system as plane on which hundreds of lives depend on daily basis every single loc in plane has to be certified to an amazing level the same for hardware which must be extremely fault tolerant how to make sure these hacks won block the system in critical time and cause crash no airline would accept to run such risk and rightly so second it just useless there will be no more use of plane as missile the whole concept is spoiled all can be done now is destroy it in flight but no crew and no passengers will ever let terrorrists pilot plane anymore should it take all their lives
think the wisdom of the crowds only applies well to topics that have high barrier to entry programming math research astro science etc highly thought out material will be recognized even by the newcomers then again these groups have scared away most of the crowd topics that are the opposite of this would be politics pop culture stuff music everyone pro on these and everyone just pulling it out of their ass discussions or articles on these have nice entertainment value at times but they re worthless for someone with mind reddit please avoid or quarentene such topics or we ll be taken hostage by stupidity of the mobs
yah they sound good for the most part but wonder if you can turn some of them off for example they re talking about moving the stop refresh button and the go button to be inside of the address bar rather than buttons to the left and right they also mentioned the rss button but that already in the address bar so not sure what they re talking about anyways hate the stop refresh and go buttons have them all disabled in my firefox wonder if ll be able to turn them off when they re inside the address bar know can turn off the existing rss button which is fine since use that but use keyboard shortcuts for stop refresh go escape enter hope these address bar additions are not forced they just make for more cluttered appearance in my opinion
right now if one hides story say in the main reddit page it will still show up in my reddit com think hide should hide across all reddits used with the same username
would like to have clear button to the left of the address field for us linux users like konqueror does

it the outcome of the player accumulated choices but it more than that the game uses set of simple rules to determine behavior such as for deciding what it means when you add an arm to specific skeleton rather than coding separate behaviors for each possible case think this is also what means when he says the behavior is emergent from the player choices in various editors the advantage is that you can handle lot more choices if you don have to code up each of them separately and also that this way the consequences of your choices can actually be surprising

nope apparently as soon as you create few useful applications you can begin pontificating about whatever you want and apparently people will actually start listening you can even charge people money for the gift of having you preach obvious ideas at them it not that disagree with these guys but find their extremely irritating it makes me want to not use any of their software ever at the very least they could have chosen to voice their opinions in way that was less preachy and condescending it kind of like how feel whenever see quentin tarantino interview feel so supremely annoyed that tempted to never see one of his movies again think everyone is lot better off when creative people do less talking and theorizing and more creating
there different levels of that though completely generated terrain is one thing diablo style puzzle piece assembly is another
are teachers and scientists paid little because they aren seen as vital or because there is greater supply of people who really want to be scientists and teachers than there is demand even if the demand is significant it an honest question don know the answer what ve read is that there are many more phds graduating than there are positions at universities or research positions at the relatively small number of big corporations that have dedicated long term research divisions government and big business seem to be the only groups with pockets deep enough to pay for new science as for teachers what ve observed is education is popular field and maybe it case of too many people thinking well not sure what want to do but ve been influenced by some really good teachers and teaching is an important job where think could have positive impact or well now ve got an english degree what are my options and it another case of too many people chasing too few jobs compare with medicine which also seems to be popular field but where demand for more doctors and nurses is growing and will continue to grow as the population ages so there an alternative explanation to society doesn see it as vital are sports stars considered vital but have no hard facts to back me up either so could be full of shit

where do you suggest that abe vigoda status should go
know it not intuitive exactly but it would indeed work ve been developing bayesian based keyword discovery text processing tool for auto tagging of documents for file indexing system certain words have different frequency in the english language for example you can safely pull out every the and of from document before comparing two instead of giving score like spam filter you get result of keywords that together make the story unique names for example are good unique item the dictionary system preassigns uniqueness instead of learning like the bayesian filter the results are similar if you like some serious discussion of methodologies can offer some insights ve been working on this and its applications to reddit for awhile especially since it has great deal of significance to my own startup as well though not in the same area my startup is making distributed file system with intelligent user agents my email is brendan kohler gatech edu if you want to contact me

interesting philosophy still think chicks inexplicably like jerks more than nice guys but being confident nice guy over nervous one is probably big plus according to the voice the game is about step by step procedures for getting laid an interesting counterpoint to that is the perspective provided in the film hitch which is less about being jerk and more about being set up with the right scenarios and then being suave enough to handle them
appreciate it sort of what was looking for take look though http hu reddit com which would you expect to take you to hu reddit com the generic reddit alien or the magyar reddit text having said that think switching it around clicking alien takes you to reddit com clicking on text takes you to current subreddit would be worse because by habit click on the alien guy may recommend introducing reddit com button to the right of stats and having the whole reddit logo go to the main page of the current section

this kind of functionality is trivial to provide with an extension it silly to clutter up the main codebase with something like this

robert novak is highly partisan hack and moreover was instrumental in the outing of cia agent for political gain am unsure why we should be taking anything he says with any degree of respect whatsoever that said since you have linked to the article will comment on it specifically his thesis is that the clintons are in disagreement over this because mr clinton suggested to dubai ports world strategy for defending the deal while senator clinton opposes the deal however who cares if the clintons are in disagreement with each other why is that in any way important the whole article reads as if his main point is ooh ooh ooh the clintons are not monolithic entity therefore george bush is the bestest ever furthermore they re not in fundamental disagreement with each other senator clinton opposition basically boils down to congress should review for days as is mandated by law and the president acted injudiciuosly by attempting to get it through without congess doing so meanwhile mr clinton support basically boils down to telling dubai ports world that they should agree to the legally mandated day review these two opinions are easily in agreement yet novak simplistically looks at everything in black and white support and oppose in an effort to gain political backing through of the issue
lot of requests that are asking for changes to affect all reddits are probably more sensible when thinking of all reddits in the same language could conceivably want to hide an article in reddit com that want to see in eo reddit com something that is good content but stupidly cross posted

cool that they had the audio he may be mostly right in what he says but he comes across as the sterotypical paranoid liberal and he should have known better than to present the information with such tone there are more tactful ways to get your point across that let people come to the conclusions you want on their own without getting you fired his kind of dialogue is more suited for talk radio than classroom
think your special comment is in essence the embodiment of the very thing which you asked for albeit unlike what you asked for it is not visible prior to clicking on the title optional displaying of description could be easily added without adding clutter by some simple javascript dom trickery to show it on request but not otherwise and since the functionality is not absolutely crucial there is no great problem even for those that have javascript disabled
the trick is though most people venture into mutual funds with idea that they will get sustained growth or at least this is the feeling get this hyper venture capital your risking your money for no growth and potential loss in hopes you can help another society get on its feet through your donated money it is kinda of mini venture capitalism that features the supply side of the equation not need clothes and food more need way to make money and hire others to make me more money

he doesn mean procedural programming usually in the context of graphics or animation procedural means that the final models textures animations were not human generated consider the walking animations apparently no human animator created these although they may have created sub sequences they re generated by analyzing the model skeletal structure and creating gaits based on this karl sims dmitri terzopoulos and michiel van de panne have done neat work in this area

the pentagon initial plans for reconstruction crumbled when it encountered an unexpected foreign and domestic insurgency oh ok so there was plan but mr bowen concluded in report focusing on the cpa staffing he unanticipated post war collapse of virtually all iraqi governing structures substantially hindered coalition efforts to develop and rapidly execute an effective reconstruction program and that initial plan was insufficient to account for the unanticipated post war collapse the plan may have sucked or have been insufficiently thought out or maybe it really was the best posible plan given avilable information but that not the same as there being no plan
according to this report the pentagon initial plans for reconstruction crumbled when it encountered an unexpected foreign and domestic insurgency we have previously been told as at http seattletimes nwsource com html nationworld html pillar wrote that the intelligence community anticipated that foreign occupying force would itself be the target of resentment and attacks including guerrilla warfare unless it established security and put iraq on the road to prosperity in the first few weeks or months after the fall of saddam the unexpected foreign and domestic insurgency was altogether quite expected

you raise an interesting point ve heard from my wife that they get between two and three candidates interviewing for position at her school that doesn seem like an overabundance to me but of course my evidence is anecdotal my wife says that plenty of her university classmates were in the position primarily because they didn know what they wanted to do that kind of thinking could lead to too many people and not enough jobs however there are plenty of unfilled teaching jobs in ca where live so much so that many teachers are teaching on emergency credentials essentially they haven completed their credential courses but the need is was so dire that they were allowed to teach the other thing that interesting is how many teachers are women at my wife school there is only one male teacher and he about to retire often think that teaching is so low paying because it thought of as female profession the men that do join the ranks of teachers seem to move up into administration more rapidly while their female counterparts tend to remain in jobs with proximity to students my wife genuinely enjoys being with the kids she teaches and has no desire to move into administration it may be that this acceptance of status quo and the fact that teacher pay isn merit based tends to keep salaries low doubt there are any simple answers
of course there are too many phds and teachers supply and demand that why teachers get paid crap if teachers quit to do something else pay would have to increase to keep enough to run school the only shortages ve ever heard of are for math science teachers in highschools used to teach math in highschool but hated it even if school can find anyone qualified there are dozens of unqualified or partially qualified individuals to fill the positions most highschools have at least few teachers that aren certified in the subjects they teach as far as grad school in math science started in bioinformatics program and quickly discovered that job opportunities weren going to be many where live arkansas would only recommend science path to someone who really loves math or science who is willing to relocate and who understands that they may end up working in another field anyway

this is just another example of someone with no background in economics thinking that they can make accurate armchair analyses of economic problems the entire argument that when iq and hours worked are controlled for science jobs are the worst paid which according to bls data isn even close to true anyhow doesn explain at all the discrepancy between men and women in the sciences when you only control for iq and hours worked you can only attempt to explain why there are few people in general in the sciences not why there are fewer women it doesn address the question of why are men willing to take the pay cut and women aren he of course tries to get around this obvious criticism by claiming that men are just myopic idiots who continue through what eventually becomes year investment just so that they don have to admit to career mistake you don need to be man to think that offensive larry summers at least qualified his statements by saying that they were just ideas this guy basically just asserts that men are dumb this sounds more like tirade that would likely follow tenure rejection than serious attempt to address an interesting question

think the conlang community is actually an ideal target for subreddit linguistic tidbits galore and obscure constructed languages after all do not appear to most of the reddit community whereas conlangers thrive on such things having said that imagine this posting will not be very good way of measuring whether there exists demand or not contacting some conlanging community personalities and asking whether they think there would be interest and whether they would be willing to advertise the conlang reddit on their pages would probably work richard kennaway http www cmp uea ac uk jrk jeffrey henning http www langmaker com contact_form htm chris bogart http www quetzal com mark rosenfelder http zompist com contact html

think reddit suffers from of group think ie mob stupidity from observing my own behavior believe am far more likely to click on links that have high scores regardless of what page looking at hot new top or recommended obviously when looking at the top page looking for links that everyone finds interesting but on hot and especially new that shouldn be my criteria interest should be instead to make matters worse because click on links that are modded up more often than links which are not modded up tend to mod up links that are modded up more than others furthermore suspect that of the links click on which are already modded up pretty high mod up the ones which are modded up the most and all of this despite the fact am trying to avoid such behavior it is just extremely hard to resist the pull of the crowd come on everyone thinks it cool maybe the only one with this problem but doubt it

bad versions of each of them rolled into one maybe does that make it good game doubt an rts fan would choose this over starcraft or strategy fan to choose this over civilization and so on of course this gives it all in one game world which might make it fun game regardless by being something different than any of its parts separately but the different game modes it presents don really seem to benefit much from being in one game at one point in spore game you ll be playing bad pac man then bad sim city then bad rts it didn look that thrilling to me at any single point of the video

no time limit how about scores aren shown on the new page that might make little more ui sense than for some things to have score and some not for no apparent reason also you might want to make it preference so people can browse with scores on the new page if they want you can reduce your own herd mentality if you like

am cautiously optimistic about this game we are seeing something that is or months from feature complete months from gold and it already looks somewhat fun that rare in the game world that means that rather than trying to get core systems working for months they re just making it fun they re making content they re making it seamless and bug free well maybe being optimistic this bodes well for the game but it is obviously sandbox game you either love em or you don typically don bought sims but played it mere only days before losing interest however other sandbox games have captured me for weeks simcity and mindrover being salient examples that because love designing for efficiency how can make the most effective robot or minimize traffic problems spore looks to be chock full of that kind of gameplay designing my creature to be effective in its environment then effective in dominating it then effective in subjugating the world solar system and the universe the portions of the game that have me refining my creature will occupy me for hours how much love this game will depend on how much slogging through other types of less fun gameplay have to do but optimistic will wright hasn made stinker yet and this one doesn look to be his first and damned if it isn original ll buy it just for that to thumb my nose at the sequal clogged publishers

agree ve learned not to click on the logo because it does not do what want think the suggestion has merit and also agree with the last suggestion put logo to the root reddit com somewhere else honestly it doesn even need to be at the top in my opinion if someone is going to sub reddit to start with they may not really care about the main reddit the homepage is not inherently that much more important than the subreddit in the mind of the visitor again imo so it does not necessarily require link to it at the top
christ haven felt that good since archie gemmill scored against holland in
not sure agree what if feature really deserves recognition and discussion from the of reddit visitors that will never visit features reddit com then again not sure disagree either everywhere else link takes you somewhere else these subreddits break that mental user model and so would cause confusion on the main pages all in all ambivilant edit also incapable of spelling ambivalent
this fosters discussions and flame wars ambivilant just don see exactly what it brings to the table in terms of quality of content
not so sure but that may be because of how view the site go top to bottom and open every link that looks interesting don really pay attention to the ratings or view the hot list and they are already pre sorted by fresh group think or view the top list and they are already pre sorted by old group think if wanna see things by group think choose the appropriate list if don then looking at the new list and why would bother reading the scores on the new list can see how that perspective might be unique but really if you re reading the new list and you re still swayed by the numbers why aren you reading hot instead
is this suggestion or bad crosspost can tell because the idea seems semi relevant to reddit but as far as practically applying this site cannot see single way voting it down but if someone can point out it relevance might change my mind
this would be nice hot history so to speak like bestsellers list show the items that have made it into the hot top in the past days this would be great way to summarize results over time more effective than the top list because of having better sort by date rather than value this feature gets my vote think it the best suggestion here as far as adding valuable content because it takes the most valuable but very ephemeral content on reddit the hot list and makes it more persistent particularly for infrequent readers of reddit this would add lot of value think of the quality of sites you get from list of sites that hit in the past days very enjoyable reading for someone that only gets to reddit every now and then
that was my first thought too the message you can sleep with geek or get screwed by bill
please explain how they lack meaning
some useful tips but it such an old article most of the tricky stuff has made its way into the language and so there are much better actually supported ways to do them

and yet somehow the democrats were incapable of fielding clearly better candidate who could win in that is such an improbability that one would almost think it was conspiracy now the talk is that they are going to run hillary in considering that large percentage of the country would vote for anyone but hillary what are the ds thinking why would they want to lose again
what the difference do you think of your bookmarks as something more than set of pages you periodically click on to see if anything changed
think this feature suggestion would fulfill your need better http features reddit com goto id nq
the author of that suggestion too they serve slightly different purposes but you are right either one would probably work
more complete list http www engadget com wwjd results
made this suggestion http features reddit com info id nq perhaps it might solve the same problem
talk about confusing the issue how is bush electoral success relevant to whether he should be impeached it isn supposed to be about popularity one way or another
agree but argue that new and hot are essentially random enough many sites only have top list this is tedious to anyone who is not first time visitor better sites have new list great for seeing the undiluted spam flooding the system reddit has hot list equivalent to minute by minute best sellers list for links for me that enough not sure random function on every page is worth the space however think some custom code for random reddit com would be nice bringing up random selection of reddit content perhaps with no negatives filter don think it should take up space on every page however
radirgy is the last one
think this would make the overall results skwed because you perhaps subconsciencely upvote bad links because they were by people you like we probably all do this already but this would make it worse
think the lack of transparency helps keep the overall result more accurate and clean
this seems like great argument as to why yahoo should buy reddit for lot of money
does anybody know when this video was from because seeing some very similar write ups from march which would mean the stuff we re seeing was in place year ago
am personally against any feature that applies differently based on someone karma it makes new users feel very unwelcome and at this stage in the game it seems like reddit would not to push users away
this would be an undesireable feature if reddit would like to discourage extended discussion of links reddit might prefer to focus attention on new links
would prefer this method http features reddit com info id nwg show number of responses to comment iff viewing that comment outside of its thread in user pages but that also suffers from myrddine concern it encourages debate rather than brief topical responses to the post
its good idea just make sure there is way can mark message as spam which will somehow impede the senders ability to send more
am perfectly fine with the level of advertising on reddit do really like graphical ads no are they necessary evil in order for sites like reddit to stay solvent currently yes
as long as it only url otherwise this would turn into friendster myspace facebook et al
pigs might fly really does story with might in it deserve to be hot
think this would skew the overall results it would probably be better to just hide which users submitted story as long as there was still way to see other stories submitted by that user if happen to like their stuff
that seems like pretty much the same idea except you have to go back to the thread every time the number changed just to see if they replied to you
lot of times post reply to someone elses comment that has question in it want quick way to see if someone did that to one of my comments and if the poster responded to my question you re right that it would foster flame wars but chances are if you are in flame war you re going to incessantly reload the discussion anyway
just because the author is venerable computer scientist doesn make him an expert in everything which is how he presents himself in these essays for instance he thinks global warming is good thing

too have found the search feature to be less than helpful not because it does not find the links need but because it does not display them to me in an order that find relevant the search is currently sorted with what appears to be similar bias as the hot filter equal bias for age young and rating high this is fine if searching for say interesting websites about fish but what if searching for certain site know it was on reddit month or so ago argh it was about that guy in that movie about his marraige lemme search for actor marriage the search is pretty useless in this case because it ll show me new stuff and high ranked stuff first rather than items that have my query term more often on similar note like feature suggestion build the keywords list for search from the target url as well as from the link title and comments this would make search vastly more useful the current tendancy for cute link titles makes them very poor candidates for valuable keywords
can someone explain this suggestion further do not understand what they are asking for
if you really felt that it needed to be discussed by the general user base you could submit link on the main page to your feature request so then someone could vote up your feature but vote down your link on the main page to train their filter that they aren interested in seeing feature requests by allowing crossposting really torn on how to vote if like the feature but don want it showing up in my recommended page
don know what the author means by the masses of academia but at least in science linux rules
hope all these other ycombinator startups pay reddit for their advertising
this is not reddit feature request as far as can tell voted down
pretty sure this was spam post trying to drum up downloads for that product but could be wrong although given that this is mike first post suspect right
what timg is asking for is to allow an author to get automatic first post on links that point back to themselves like this one the reason is because if his explanatory post gets modded down or if other posts get modded above his then the explanation will get lost in the conversation the explanation of no link post like this one should be the first thing people see it should be forced to the top somehow perhaps by having separate details field in the form for submitting new link however it is done there needs to be way to reliably annotate no link posts so that the detailed description is the first thing someone sees when going to the comments

having done quite bit of searching can seem to find way to unbind destroy arbitrary objects in javascript ve found myself wanting to do things like unbind document getelementbyid foo onclick and having to rewrite the interhtml of the enclosing element instead this is big problem
what struck me about what he said is that his same reasoning would justify the uk scheme he said there absolutely no bar on collecting plates in public is there no bar to using the collected plate data to find out where anyone has been
wow these have really been updated since last year and thought there were lot then
am leaning against this idea it easy to post sites many blogs make it easier with reddit button there no reason to auto add got some new toothpaste today from an rss feed the human touch to added sites and the karma system involved helps keep the number of spam posts down we don need to automatically subject ourselves to posts that nobody finds interesting and rate them down when surprise surprise nobody cares at least with the manual system one person thought it was worth adding
not so sure especially since the server already auto logs you on via cookie you can get much less secure

it works if and only if the property is bound using javascript not if it written in the html directly that what having problem with you ve clarified the problem anyway you can use delete and object undefined on dom object properties created by your script at runtime but not properties that are set as html tag attributes what really trying to do is little more complicated trying to delete the hrefs from series of links and add onclick handlers after page loads so that it will have static navigation links in browsers without javascript and dhtml otherwise more details http foobar infogami com blog js_anchors all the links are neatly organized in span so had no trouble getting the effect want by rewriting the innerhtml of the span just annoyed that can do this in more direct way the point of the dom as understand it is to manipulate the elements on your page as objects with properties instead of strings

from the touch clarity site lt quote gt you only have few page impressions to keep visitors or lose them if they do not see compelling reason to go further they re gone any visitor who lands on any page of touch clarity targeting enabled site is individually served the most relevant content and promotions leading to multi million annual revenue increases for our customers lt qoute gt maybe way to monetize the reddit algorithm
and the fbi cares about one person smoking bowl besides that reddit can probably get away with letting posts slide if they take special care not to monitor posts if their policy is not to act as gatekeepers they wont be expected to act as gatekeepers since they have moderation systems which are intended to act as the control they don doubt they have any legal obligation to report that especially given how much trouble it would be for what has chance of being sarcastic remark

well the dea would care about your bowl obviously you mean to sell pot to all the year olds in your neighborhood sarcasm it blows my mind that poor nicole richardson got ten years for passing along phone number the injustice of it shakes me to my soul you ll excuse me but going to do some drugs myself right now by this mean going to have beer and then smoke some tobacco
tried stun gunning myself in the arm about years ago it wasn pleasant but it wasn debilitating either that unit had battery too maybe they vary in strength lot but my personal opinion is that this story is bunk
pathetic and sad if you haven noticed ruby is becoming popular fast simply because of ror while ruby is much better language than php php itself pretty poor language became very popular simply due to being great for making web apps and at this point it is the defacto standard for web apps and thus it will continue to thrive on no matter how many problems it has what is python the defacto standard for when people think of web programming they think of php or ruby when people think of systems programming they think of when people thing of hardware intensive apps such as games they think of embedded languages lua is quickly taking over that market and that not good place for python to be no matter how good of language it is if its just seen as an alternative to all of those languages for different types of apps it will continue to lose momentum to point where using python isn as effective as it could be because all the programmers and libraries are in other languages python is great language unfortunately it will become quickly overshadowed if it isn marketed effectively that one things that ror guys got right how to market something ruby lacked it before ror and the massive increase in popularity shows this
maria montessori knew this in the early the observation that very young children enjoy participating in everyday practical life activities like cleaning dishes washing tables and cooking food is one of the basic foundations of the montessori method young children also enjoy caring for others and especially for younger children than themselves it gives them sense of importance and fulfillment montessori encourages this because it is the best way to develop character attributes in children that will help them throughout their lives http www michaelolaf net cw famcare html

you can reduce this to supply and demand the employers in education are overwhelmingly public institutions esp below the college level these employers can arbitrarily up their salary offers to retain or attract teachers teachers aren paid poorly because there is large supply and comparatively little demand they re paid poorly because the funding available for public education is limited and because much of it is poached by textbook publishers educational consultants administrators and other sources in fact would say that teachers are faced with something approximating price fixing or monopolization they are free to leave their positions if they aren satisfied with their pay but all the competing employers they can move to are paying the same wage regarding your experience yes to be successful academic one must be flexible about where one lives and works

and this is comparable because the country was founded on the slavery oppression and abuse of conservative christians conservative christians have never been considered sub human never had to fight for equal treatment under the law never been largely confined to ghettos lacking in basic social structure or ways to get out christians run the show in the us and currently the conservative variety are the ones running our government black people actually have been denied the suffrage for the majority of our country existence and while you certainly could joke about how they don belong here after their ancestors were forcibly ripped from their homeland to be tortured it just makes you look like big fat jerk sorry for going on so long about this but it really got me riled up it really is such an unthinking comparison and think it only perpetuated because it makes for good partisan slamming and seriously worldnetdaily that like tattooing nutjob on your forehead or linking to arianna huffington and finally as an end note garrison keillor seems to be fairly religious chrisitan though not conservative

this is my personal opinion but social interaction is overrated many people come to online forums looking for similar minded people come to online forums looking for interesting ideas even if someone has the most insightful interesting informative post ever meme spreading my interest extends to that post alone really don care about the person behind it so extra interaction schemes to assist me in forming some kind of community with the other people are completely lost on me on like to reiterate others might find it useful would not

oopsie didn notice heh the hot list is the finest feature of reddit relative activity of link is fabulous measure of the value of link did link get the most interest during the past minutes most click throughs most vote ups then it the hottest item yes know the hot algorithm is more complicated than that even if the item falls off in interest quickly it still an excellent measure of relative quality because it essentially competing on relatively even field competing with the other new links only the top list is an uneven field because they show up on the top list they get more people seeing them and thus more votes keeping them on the top list but hot only stays hot while it on the new and hot lists it gets boost once it makes it to the hot page but it at least has an even chance with the other new items to get to the hot page so hot is the best determiner for link quality in my opinion rather than absolute value absolute value is also good determiner but it less interesting it less fun less unique it also harder to pick cutoff value because that cutoff will change over time as reddit gets more popular the same quality link will get higher score as more people vote on it but the hot list is rather absolute either you made it to the top or not more links won change that much nor will more users so it more consistent metric less dependant on the quantity of users voting

really question the sanity of anyone who is prepared to take advice from someone like this guy the other articles on that site are even more cringe inducing perhaps instead of playing the game he could spend time to expand his vocabulary to include words other than vibe
this reads well until you get to the last paragraph then you realize the guy basic assumptions and it all becomes sadly hilarious so how do you raise kids to be high achievers
guessing you mean links that go nowhere but to the comments page they re like the semantic equals of nt labels on forums comment that is in the subject line only and has no body perhaps small graphic that has nl no link capital nl inside box with alt text no link it could be done in css too if using small image was distasteful placed at the end of the url before the domain name it would have the same semantic placement as well and think many people would understand its purpose after following one or two of them

ruby lacked it before ror and the massive increase in popularity shows this perhaps but most rubyists could give rat ass if ruby became uber popular ruby was showing gradual steady popularity growth before rails had this simply continued that would have been great and it would have avoided the conflation of rails with ruby itself it nice that so many people have heard of ruby but less so if all they know or bother with is single framework api if these people go on to learn actual ruby great but that remains to be seen ruby sells itself killer apps are nice but not required

finite state automata fsas are way of modeling theoretical computer tasks or modeling theoretical languages they were invented before modern computers deterministic and non deterministic finite state automata dfas and nfas in my coursework have different rules but both can be used to represent the same problem sets languages they can solve certain regular expression matching problems regular expressions are common programming tool actual regex implementations in various programming languages are to the best of my knowledge based on these theoretical automata aside from nfas and dfas there are pushdown automata pdas embedded pushdown automata epdas deciders turing machines etc all of which are useful for different discussions in computer science automata theory is also major part of formal linguistics guess computer science sortof grew out of formal linguistics maybe someone else here is more educated about that

features reddit links to http reddit com textless alien graphic links to http features reddit com does not make sense may recommend the whole logo link to the current subreddit as numerous people suggested it should in several feature requests and adding reddit com button to the right of stats am astonished that the geek legions disagree with me or at least do not agree in larger numbers the semantic nonsensicality of the current solution really irritates me
agreed but this doesn just apply to the outside community was allowed to choose my own tools on smallish project for my employer very large company and ended up using python with wxpython for gui as you said the results speak for themselves the guido time machine allowed for impressive results with only me working on the project the previous version took many more people and more than twice as long to implement immediately the exposure of python increased around the office and people were considering it as an alternative for use in future projects
this is an irritating article with jumble of arguments that don much pertain to the goal of ending the war on drugs supposedly innocent bystanders and too many minorities going to jail are both side issues both of these things happen with most types of crime they don have whole lot to do with what is wrong with the war on drugs also drug addicts and dealers are responsible for majority of violent crime especially if you include alcoholics this article tries to show that people who take drugs are mostly just hurting themselves this isn true because of the war on drugs that is the real argument the war on drugs causes almost all of the problems we relate to drugs why do people steal and murder to get more drugs because drugs are expensive addictive and illegal legalizing recreational drug use will stop of those problems with obtaining and using drugs the addictive nature of drugs can be managed like it is now by rehab and education just think of all the money we would have to manage drug use in the us if we ended all spending on the war on drugs and taxed recreational drug sales last argument historically prohibition has always started with ideas of creating utopian society without social problems the argument for prohibition blams all that plagues us upon alcohol and drugs can society see the idiocy of this belief the historians among you need to look up some of the famous prohibitionists and their rhetoric to see how right am
cooperation and kin altruism are essentially different from the type of altruism discussed in this study not because the mechanisms are different the same mechanism might lead to cooperation kin altruism or non reciprocal altruism but there are different value propositions in all three categories so it is worthwhile to examine all three categories separately these toddlers are helping someone they don know who will not reward them and will not be around long enough to form an alliance with and yes any parent could have told you this but it still neat

this is true for older teachers who have already made significant investments in their teaching skillsets it not true for younger teachers that can still switch to another profession among my cohort people years out of college ve got lot of friends that tried teaching for year or two most of them end up saying like it but there no way in hell doing this for year for the rest of my life then they go back to law school or get job at biotech firm or otherwise enter the decently paid workforce this is major reason why the public education system sucks the labor price is fixed by political decisions that leaves the quality of employees as the only variables those who can get higher paying jobs in industry leave unable to justify the low pay and long hours even if they do like it unless they re masochistic saint but those are rare that leaves only the employees that industry doesn want to teach our kids the problem will likely get worse because many of the retiring baby boomer teachers entered the profession when there were glass ceilings that prevented otherwise capable women from taking high powered corporate jobs when my mom became teacher in it was almost unheard of for woman to be in senior management or law partner or another high paid position she became teacher because that was what most smart college educated women did back then it was that or secretary or in few rare cases journalist now there no glass ceiling so my sister going to be petroleum geologist my female friends are going to be doctors and lawyers and few are even looking at wall street careers

this article is not economically sound firstly apple has no monopoly of any sort there are portable media players of all shapes and sizes selling briskly by numerous companies second the cost has stayed the same because the demand has allowed the processes to be developed that create larger storage in smaller size at cheaper cost per unit there is no arbitrary limit to the amount of data tiny harddrive can potentially hold in the future and it is impossible to predict the future innovations apple will inject into its portable media product line the walkman anology is not correct either while you can purchase portable cd player they suck any estimations regarding apple fall from the top are worthless speculation
in gmail when you list your mail on certain topic say news then the items in that list that are also tagged with different topic like the inbox or info or personal or work or whatever other tags you ve made have their other tags listed in front of the subject smaller and in different color an example screenshot lifted from an old ziffdavis review http www dotnet com myrddin gmailinbox gif on that screenshot you can see the other categories the email was tagged as like zd general mail or jan miano if you had been looking at the jan miano email you would see the inbox tag you don see the tag of the one your in that applies very clearly to reddit if you are looking at subreddit like features then you would not see the features tag in front of every link but if someone crossposted to the main group you would see reddit in front of the link in the main reddit looking at that same post you would see features in front of it this makes crossposts extremely easy to spot the purpose of the link is immediately clear items that are not crossposted will not cause clutter and anyone who has used gmail will be familiar with the mechanic plus trust that gmail has put lot of research into how clear this method is to users so suspect it one of the best ways to portray crossposting

it is indeed pathetic but maybe it understandable from the standpoint of limited resources let me explain language having more users means that the language also has more potential developers which can continue to improve the language and build it libraries perhaps guido is worried about the rise of the language for this very reason or maybe it all just plain old jealousy at any rate these posts certainly seem to reveal pettyness

exactly few years back when deciding between python and ruby it initially came down to the indentation issue so ended up choosing ruby now that know ruby well glad chose it for other reasons like code blocks pythonistas will holler about how indentation isn problem if you ve got your editor set up correctly and that may well be true the other thing to consider is that language culture that says there only one right way to do it is not going to be as appealing as language culture that says there are many ways to do it people like freedom and choice not preaching suspect lot of people are being turned off by all the preaching about the one right way that goes on in the python community

pretty shallow and overall dumb piece everyone likes to point out things like canada has trillion barrels of oil in the alberta tar sands which is unfortunately irrelevant what important is at what rate can we produce oil from them and how much energy does it take to get each barrel of oil if the oil fields are refilling abiotically great are they refilling at rate of million barrels day approx our current extraction rate no it won stop oil from going to barrel then if we have enough uranium to fulfill all our energy needs for the next million years great but can we build nuclear power plant every day for the next years to replace oil by then no oh well methane hydrates hold enough natural gas blah blah blah can we extrac enough without creating runaway greenhouse effect no sigh see everything got it problems ton of oil is no good unless you can turn it into usable oil at rate of million barrels day and increasing all the time and it also has to compete with the current ratio of energy out energy in of we currently enjoy from pumping liquid oil an article that simply counts reserves and resources and concludes we re fine is just dumb

abhor the notion of parents micromanaging their children to be overachievers but this seems bit too hands off for me gt in short love and support them as they challenge and search for themselves fulfill their dreams and become the people they choose to be love and support agree with but the rest seems bit pollyanna ish to me since when do children know what best for their long term interests or short term for that matter
yes the goverment has authority over its constituents like parents do over their children government primary duties are to protect their constituents and promote their health as is reasonably possible just like parents with children

in general parent love and care for their children they impose limit because children haven yet learned enough to take care of themselves they are dependants on their parents for their well being it is ridiculous to say all grown adults haven learned enough to take care of themselves the government is made up of those same adults it just so happen the adults that don like drugs for reason don understand the government is placing certain narrow world view on others limiting their freedom and then incarcerating to enforce that world view
think here he means real achievers not the text book pre programmed kind some of the most genuine talented kind kids grew up with had the least input from their parents and were basically left to their own devices as they grew older

wtf is reddit becoming total waste of time this site is ancient highly referenced useful but new and relevant don think so should go through my old links and post few hundred of these mon first the story of mel and then this in the same couple of days spare me the ancient links
you may disagree with my recommendation but cannot see how you could possibly disagree with my observation do you really find it makes sense that features reddit is the part that does not take you to features reddit com oh and no would not like it better the other way around that would be even worse
autocontrast and saturation ve submitted the features to the reddit
in the usa we elect our representatives in government to be our voice when we elect our leaders we are not empowering them to tell us what to do we are empowering them to do our will the end result is similar want health and safety standards and help elect people who will give me those but wary of the implications of thinking of our representatives as being in parent child relationship with us
it is also ridiculous to ignore the fact that there are many grown adults who act irresponsibly and make irresponsible decisions sometimes whole industry can spring up around few people behaving badly and the totality of this can be more harmful to the society than if the problem were just outlawed you and can dispute when particular people problem and their consequences are enough to require legal prohibition but think the principle in and of itself is sound
no the government is not an independent entity distinct from the people it is an organization of limited number of people who are temporarily granted few certain authorities not rights to carry out specific limited actions on behalf of the population as whole government primary responsibility is to maximize the individual freedom of each of the citizens who have as the constituency granted the government its temporary existence as barry goldwater said so succinctly government that is big enough to give you all you want is big enough to take it all away
what source are you using for that figure used to work in uranium exploration am geology prof and am kind of curious if you just pulled that number out of your ass which is what it looks like cause there is hell of lot of uranium lying around in northern saskatchewan in parts of west africa of course given much of the argument here including the very notion that being mr lisp makes mccarthy somehow pundit on energy suspect hot air is the real source of infinite energy around here

as an embittered victim of exactly this process believe have little insight into this process the goals that these kids have are many and varied but many involve graduate degree and graduate school is vastly easier to get into if you attend the right undergraduate school this is particularly true in cs where graduate schools frequently only accept students from handful of schools with almost none coming from anywhere else aside from international students cs is an extreme case but many top graduate schools as well as law and medical schools also have this phenomenon to some degree so these people are rightfully stressed out about getting in it not something wrong with them that causes this instead fault the admissions departments at the top universities they re trying to get into admissions departments provide applications chock full of lists of line item activities the clear implication being that you are at disadvantage if you can overflow the lists with your many and varied extracurricular activities and the people who get in bear this out every classmate know who got into an ivy had nauseating number of useless meaningless that they didn care about they select for things like community service and sports and high school grades by selecting for this they cause the stressed out overachievers to concentrate on meaningless activities my solution would be to change the criteria first throw out every dedicated admissions officer none of them know anything other than how to make bullshit meaningless criteria split admissions departments into admissions for each area of study engineering science humanities etc and staff each department with professors from that area of study professors know their area and so they will recognize when applicants do something remarkable in that area where dedicated admissions officers clueless about every particular field will be blind to achievements in any kind of technical field then change the criteria so that the most important thing is to have done something remarkable an art project programming project history paper an english paper an engineering project in the area being applied for report on or submission of that remarkable thing should be the central aspect of the application

rebuttals emacs is also very widely installed and if you re planning to do any significant amount of text editing on computer you can probably take the small amount of time it takes to install your text editor of choice if it isn there already that not an argument for either emacs or vi both editors have lots of users so this shouldn sway you much after all notepad probably has more users than emacs and vi combined but that doesn mean that it decent text editor iirc paul graham used to use emacs but had to switch to vi at some point for historical reasons that are no longer relevant he going on momentum and so should you just learn good text editor and get skilled at using it

actually think the implication here which is that you necessarily understand your own interests better than someone else is false as an outsider you frequently have better view into someone prospects and interests than they do themselves so while not huge fan of most parents do believe they can help lot in this respect in the same way that coach can help an athlete in competition

the article offers lame solution to lame problem the source of the problem is of the admission system and the solution offered by the author is do what you want but it does not solve the problem most kids to not know what they want and they do not know the in making their career decisions speak from personal experience had no idea what would like to do up to second year of college so what do you do with these kids the answer is to teach them bit of everything plus the responsibly of adulthood and college should be more faults tolerant by looking for one or few major achievement rather than series of minor achievements by doing so you have given kids the resource to make the right decision and reduced the pressure to have them choose early

wasn aware that they were two seperate links until read this post
one of the main issues raised is that more needs to be discovered about drugs and the effects on humans certain drugs such as marijuana cannot be classified as dangerous when clearly they are much less dangerous than cigarettes and alcohol and therefore research needs to be done on the effects on society of the legalising of such drugs lsd was after all legal medical drug at first which made it onto the black market and into the hands of many and subsequently made illegal after politicians became scared if restictions of use are put onto these less harmful drugs such as driving restrictions etc and they are made with quality products then can see why it could cause too much of problem on society in no mre or less way than alcohol has just look at amsterdam very relaxed calm atmosphere how can that be detrimental

actually the problem is credential inflation as soon as any new way for high schoolers to make themselves stand out appears these soul eating parents and counselors pounce on it the eventual result is that so many kids have ex high sat scores ap exams in general subjects rather than specific interests that it no longer helps anything the real problem is that kids aren trying to be good enough for the college they re trying to be better than each other forgive my paul graham but any purely relative ie no absolute standard just be better than the other guy competition like that will eventually become pathologized and degenerated it an arms race

getting tired of the title excuse here everytime someone bitches about having posted the same story earlier someone else inevitably critiques their title are we really to dumb here to get past the title now obviously there are some cases where this is true because someone contrived horrible title but think the majority of the time what dennis says here about the momentum of the posts makes sense sgm idea to hide the scores is good one why do we need to see the actual number it is impossible to not be biased

gt yes the goverment has authority over its constituents like parents do over their children government primary duties are to protect their constituents and promote their health as is reasonably possible just like parents with children wrong parent authority over child is predicated on the assumption that the parent has more knowledge wisdom and maturity than the child of course that not always true but it true often enough such is not the case between government officials and private citizens the people who work in government are by and large the same as the people that don they generally represent the same cross section of society with probably more of leaning towards wealth and privilege on the government side at least at the highest levels therefore there can be no reasonable assumption of greater knowledge wisdom or especially maturity on the part of government officials so there is no justification on which to base parent child type of relationship
gt don keep it on while carrying it around don even put it in hibernation huh does this guy understand what hibernation is when windows machine goes into hibernate mode it completely and totally powers itself off including the hdd which he claims is vulnerable in this state the only difference between hibernate and shut down is that in the former the contents of ram and the state of the system are written to the hdd to be restored on the next boot perhaps he is confusing hibernate and sleep mode but would expect more care in wording from an it professional dishing out advice on laptop care have year old dell inspiron nearly every time turn it off use hibernate up until last december was in school and would walk around campus every day of the week carrying my hibernated laptop in my backpack have yet to experience single problem with the hdd or anything else for that matter most of his advice is good but this claim is just dumb

you should know more about the politics in missouri if for no other reason because missouri has voted for the winning presidential candidate in something like every election in the last years people perceive mo as conservative stronghold but this isn really true mo is more of microcosm of the nation the entire politics of the state can be divided into two sets st louis and everywhere else politicians from the middle of the state play these wonderful games and people support them because they want to put stick in the eye of the east coast types in st louis very interesting thing is happening currently where missouri star conservative senator jim talent was forced to withdraw his support for stem cell research ban because lot of the republican business establishment came out against it missouri includes what is supposedly the medical school in the country and don like the idea of california taking all the good people
the usual economics explanation for low teacher salaries is that there are few opportunities for teachers to improve their productivity there are few economies of scale in teaching as other fields industry finance etc improve their productivity through technology teaching salaries must rise to point above that which their productivity would indicate to attract competitive candidates or the nonmonetary rewards have to be improved social standing perks like the chance to get tenure etc as technology assisted learning improves distance learning net based tools possibly things like podcast based lectures and computer aided testing homework the gap between teachers pay and productivity relative to the competition for labor may narrow but don count on it in the short run

think the point is that the typical dictionary brute force attack doesn focus on anything outside of the ascii lower there may be difficulty in portability the upper characters vary from region to region one of the reasons to use utf encoding instead most of the time but it easy to input on windows box don see how it that much more cumbersome than the typical technique the five columns approach if you can remember an character password with lower upper numeric and special characters you can remember an character one that includes an alt combo the best method for getting password remains social engineering most non techies who re required to do hard password end up writing them down somewhere

really like this idea and having the number of distinct views would also be nice option if my article is at and has had distinct views it is actually much better than being at with only distinct views it would make sense that above or below certain scores these proportions become quite similar but imagine when still in the single digits the difference could be drastic

think the ideal solution concerning features for software is basic easy to use expandable base program extensions add ons plugins should be easy to develop find install and use successfull example for this is firefox less successfull but still very good examples are miranda im and foobar their problem is that they are not easy enough to use for most people if compared to for example the standard icq client and winamp but every time thoroughly explained miranda or foobar to someone less computer literate they found these programs great and started to ask me for plugins after while here another problem in this case for foobar plugins are sometimes hard to find and often only for certain version

ruby is becoming popular fast simply because of ror not many had heard or wanted to try out ruby until the buzz spread about ror when was looking for new language to learn chose python for obvious reasons and the others around me chose ruby just because of ror they might not ever do some ror themselves but they tried out ruby it doesnt matter if python and ruby continue to grow it will be the best outcome but where is the killer app that has the for python php is the most prominent of lamp and ruby is the of the ror marketing would have been implicitly done if any one of the python apps had engraved in their name for python but there is no in django none in turbogears either and though there is in zope and plone its not for python and would have loved to see bittorrent have in there somewhere to market python aint wrong as it only creates awareness about the language for new programmers would love to see an app where the python stands out
ahaaa taki nerdy
removed
but that would encourage people to submit variants of the things that are popular already would you prefer wide range of interesting things to read or would you prefer rehashes of stuff you ve already read
was able to read it unregistered
personally never read the scores before click on the article they re very faint grey do you really find it that hard to ignore them anyway it not question of being too dumb to get past the title but rather too lazy reddit is for browsing don have the time or inclination to click on every link so generally scanning the page looking for something that catches my eye an eye catching title is naturally going to get more interest
regarding the final point less is difficult that why less is more love the following quote of antoine de saint exupery designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add but when there is nothing left to take away
good point in fact reddit probably shouldn work with absolute numbers of votes at all it seems more sensible to divide the number of votes by the number of people who ve viewed the page not the number of page views so if you have up vote after person has seen your page that lot better than up vote after people have seen it it also much less statistically significant maybe that should be factored in too sure there mathematical formula to tell you how much to rely on given result

the title of the article is bit misleading actually the chinese aren planning separate internet but an additional alternate root system so that chinese characters can be used as urls this would make the internet more accessible to ordinary chinese with little or no knowledge of english think it great idea the internet is already very anglo centric as it is and giving more non english speakers access can only be good thing for theme and everybody else
lol this is funny sad thing to see how much the usa and china have in common the thing is that the people responsible for all this are the first ones to condem countries that openly censor internet content it may be happening to soldiers in iraq now but how long do you think it will take them to implement these measures in some form or another at home
it is true that the two systems are still interoperable as english characters can still contact their domains also feel there is little reason for concern about the future if china someday wished to cut themselves off from the world then that would be their own decision and there would be little we could do to prevent it anyhow in all likely hood this is not their motive and therefore the hype is actually quite misleading

was including the noninteractive replaces in that count and miscounted changed my sentence which admittedly are not directly important huh indeed still used emacs eight years without even knowing that it seems that last one wasn in my cheatsheets learned about yesterday and just now figured and verified there probably too and of course ll forget some of these by next week only to be found after googling lot or what was it also something wish known about eight years ago
it seems that it easier to get things hot on the weekdays than on the weekends could be completely wrong
save on gas less oil more fun
because every other program in existance does all of that it called usability people new to programs people not geeks can use based on fair expectations without learning key shortcuts that will only ever apply to single program still have little intuition about emacs guess and google that just not useful except to the select few to which there is good reason to do so

have thought about this as well but your suggestion has to consider that some people are voting to train their preferences and are not expressing an opinion on the quality of the article if reddit could figure out way to separate training user preferences from voting on articles your suggestion might work how about training preferences from the saved articles not votes
my least favorite part of blogs the name field is required the mail field is required why are these fields required well weblogs inc blogs require mail verification but otherwise there is no reason at all spam bots ignore these stupid restrictions but humans just get annoyed

having done extensive ppc advertising on the web know very well that the headline is everything including setting the expectations for the follow on page that determine how long someone will read it to find the goodies promised in the headline anyone buying ppc ads if you don study it intensively you are likely paying way too much
you forget that every other program probably invented their conventions decade or two after emacs why should emacs users have to relearn everything and most unix programs use emacs keys anyway believe you are talking windows and or mac here and the very recent trend to emulated their behaviour on linux

it always the same when usuable thing or thought is turned into silver bullet and dogma and successors always come up with hey now can suspend thinking anyone remember the infamous never use goto unbelievable much imperative languages have been ruined by forbidding any kind of unconditional jumps six nested loops and several boolean conditions to avoid the simple but dreaded goto as error handler instead getting your work done force someone using emacs because it is superior to vi vim it is and balrogs can fly

don like reilly either but think you re all missing key point here radio shows are broadcast on delay ve heard callers get cut off for saying stuff on sports radio before it confusing to the listener because few seconds of airtime disappear so what likely happened here is that the caller said something that really was obscene and they hit the button to splice it out in real time to the listener it sounds like the guy was cut off right at the start of the call

yahoo still is portal lifestyle portal or something so it makes sense for yahoo to have all that content on the homepage while google is mainly search engine and by the way their homepage looks think they are emphasizing that they are first and foremost search engine while they both provide web search and are competitors they really provide lot of different value the web is better place with them both being different yahoo shouldn need to be google and vice versa since google is doing such great job at search find that other companies that try to take users from google and copy google homepage style are just plain stupid they should compete sure but most importantly compliment that way they have more chances of survival hehe easy for me to say

ok cool gentoo portage is written about python but honestly nobody but very limited set of very smart people know or care about gentoo portage system that what php and now rails are getting right they are marketing to the little man not the linux programmers and the know languages guys with rails and php people who have never done web development before are learning them that brings fresh blood into the area and it becomes the everyman language and yeah while rails is getting quite few big name adopters from the java world and such that not the majority of people and as result its situation where bunch of less experienced programmers are able to say see even uses rails with python it seems like its more of situation of really smart peers sitting around and saying isn this great what ve done with python wrote portage for gentoo what have you been doing oh you wrote an entire database system amazing you just don hear about everyday newbie programmers picking up python unlike php and such obviously it does happen that just not where the focus of the python community is at just look at mysql vs postgres most informed people would agree that postgres is better but mysql is infinitely more popular due to who they marketed to ie the little man and like some of the people responding to guido original post were saying that why marketing python has never worked because the types of people who use python don really understand how to market things efficiently hell look at the python webpage few months ago when was personally deciding whether to use ruby or python that what turned me off thank god got smart and am now actually learning python but hey even something as small as the name can have big impact how many people want to use programming langauge that brings forward images of big snake how about programming language with four letters in its name that brings forward ideas of riches there big difference there albeit an underlying physcological one understand why python was named what it was but people picking language these days don and think the name is an example of the mindset behind python its just never known how to market itself one of the deciding factors that had me wanting to use python was the underlying knowledge that google uses python heavily suspect many of your php scripter type people have no idea about this and saw book with few small apps written in it it had an aura about it now honestly having started to learn python that aura no longer exists as much but python needs that aura which makes people think that python is used by interesting people to do interesting things

but that the thing the first law doesn quite dispel that ridiculous idea usually when you travel you are moving from one level of potential energy to the same level it is not the first law that stops you from getting there for free my problem is that if anything conservation of energy gives the impression that you can power cars on water alone when you accelerate you convert hydrogen oxygen into water and when you stop you convert water back into hydrogen oxygen whilst this does work to some extent regenerative braking it does not work perfectly and this is due to the second law admit didn make this point very clear in my last post

you don see the game on the link added just googled for some other games that worked on it sucks how many sites have just uploaded them to their own servers mean this is how make my living cartoon network gets daily stats of all the games and they decide which are successful by comparing those numbers at least most of the sites just link back to cartoonnetwork com which is great also didn mean any offense to the link poster very honored that people like the game also can take credit for the whole thing several people worked on it
absolutely spot on about cs grad schools they won admit it but statistics fail to back up their claims solution smart kids please don bother with cs grad school they don deserve you fill it to the brim with morons
actually the basis of the american admission system works fairly similarly your admission is theoretically based on school grades and sat act scores these are aptitude tests like your psychometrics the sat comes in math reading and writing parts college admissions officers theoretically use these to determine if you re suited for their university environment the way it got screwed up was that everyone and his kid brother had high grades and sat scores so they started counting and volunteer work to find the really dedicated students then aps advanced placement classes taken for college credit were invented and they started counting those too of course nowadays everyone who anyone plays at least one sport has high sat act scores and superb grade average volunteers for worthy cause is part of the student government which mind you is popularity contest and still manages to fight crime on the side in short lt gt it an arms race lt gt the process got screwed up when we had system like yours because people got too good at gaming that system
is there any difference between the levels or is it just random
that where it starts though isn it sure he got every legal right to only include material he agrees with comments that are favorable etc but the guy reaches sadly very large audience and such clever censoring ends up presenting very convincing one sided argument sure he not violating the bill of rights but he is still censoring speech exposing that censorship is vital to showing people how one sided and weak minded the guy is the more people know he just nukes content he dislikes the less credibility he ll have and the fewer people he can actually influence ve never had any respect for someone who can argue point on merit and has to instead rely on censorship like this if you can take on critic there something really wrong with you or your platform

no this is not the solution cs grad schools are the ultimate paradise for hackers you get paid to do nothing but hack on cool new stuff and write up the results of hacking and also teach up and coming proto hackers also you re surrounded by other amazing hackers in the form of other grad students and professors see http www cs cmu edu eharchol gradschooltalk pdf for more on why this is true incidentally can completely blame the cs grad schools that are worst this way for having this policy pg essay on undergraduation is one reason why the professors reading the applications know the professors recommending the students another reason why is that the top undergrads at the top several cs schools get transformed into experienced researchers by the time they graduate because there so much available research at the top schools while top undergrads at lesser schools can do this and so the grad school admissions people can tell whether the latter applicants will actually be good at research instead the solution is just to go through the system get into the right undergrad you will be much happier because the top four grad schools are highly concentrated with smart people some of the top four are worse than others for this kind of thing know many grad students at uc berkeley who didn come from the right undergrad but no grad students at cmu who didn so if you don get into the right undergrad you aren completely screwed you just have to crank up how amazing you are couple times

sub human no clearly not think that religion tends to be bad thing particularly for those outside the religion in question think that it either requires or engenders an annoying and dangerous form of intellectual laziness but that just makes you possibly intellectually lazy humans not sub human christians are just special case of religious people and no one that am aware of thinks they are sub human do find it interesting that the religious seem so consistently to think that they are under attack were there push for hydrodynamics to be taught in sunday school christians would go batshit and with good reason people would be trying to steal time from religious study and devote it to something else there are as far as know no serious efforts to institute anything like this if people came to maternity wards and harassed expectant single moms telling them that they should get abortions christians would go batshit again with good reason that does not happen either so how exactly do you think you are being attacked

negative moderation considered harmfull negative moderation can be used by people with ill will or to manipulate opinions just think of the recent wikipedia event where politicians altered content likewise politicians can mod down an article this is system that is subject to political manipulation all it takes is something like staff members to get points we know that articles are bad when they re really but how do we know the rating hasn been tampered with we don these are days of political propaganda these are the days when the administration set out to influence information difused on the internet this is donald rumsfeld dictum see donald rumsfeld new front in the war on terror http www danieldrezner com archives html and suppose reddit will become victim of such actions sites such as digg won because they don have negative ratings

you seem quite bitter found the reading informal engaging and nice diversion from comp bio studying the analogies between perl and ruby are particularly well chosen as opposed to the usual hackneyed chestnuts about lisp and and had not seen them presented as succinctly anywhere else the rants about are misguided it still pleasant light reading if you were looking for pure substance the introduction ought to have tipped you off suspect others with few years programming and watching companies rise and fall will discover that they identify with the author experiences ymmv regardless prefer his writing style to yours

says published in but seems quite up to date well python folks are just like the smalltalk folks who waited forever to replace and then java came along and screwed them royally and permanently oops ruby doing exactly that to python right now today practically overnight python would have taken over the world but it has two fatal flaws the whitespace thing and the permafrost thing don mod me down didn write this stuff just agree with it here my suggestion http reddit com info id nh qck for fixing whitespace now we just need permafrost to thaw bit

append the more biblically soaked portion of lincoln nd inaugural he was coming up to the conclusion of the bloodiest war by far in relative numbers that the us ever fought not sure britain ever had such bloodbath don have time to check ll add that lincoln adherence to orthodox christianity has been much disputed then and since each looked for an easier triumph and result less fundamental and astounding both read the same bible and pray to the same god and each invokes his aid against the other it may seem strange that any men should dare to ask just god assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men faces but let us judge not that we be not judged the prayers of both could not be answered that of neither has been answered fully the almighty has his own purposes woe unto the world because of offenses for it must needs be that offenses come but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh if we shall suppose that american slavery is one of those offenses which in the providence of god must needs come but which having continued through his appointed time he now wills to remove and that he gives to both north and south this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense came shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in living god always ascribe to him fondly do we hope fervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away yet if god wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword as was said three thousand years ago so still it must be said the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nation wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations

it is useful to distinguish between private tv show refusing to air the comments of caller the government banning speech by imposing fines or imprisonment private individual threatening harassment or physical harm against another the first one might be considered editorial policy the second censorship and the third illegal threats it isn very useful to label them all censorship realize that there is tendency to call any limitation of speech of any sort by anybody government or citizen or organization as censorship but it makes it difficult to discuss the issue when all these situations are lumped together
really aren the whitespace and frost the same thing or at least mutually reinforcing skipped python and jumped all over ruby when the pickaxe book came out for those reasons that python uses whitespace and pass instead of the traditional algol end marker syntax is matter of taste right yet there was so much discussion that it became sore subject then after enough endless pointless debate and flamage it become closed subject today you had just better love that block syntax or shut up and learn to love it fire and ice there you go

gt government has no right to make criminals of its citizens for taking actions which do not threaten the liberties of other people but assume you agree the contrary is true government does have right to make criminals out of citizens whose actions threaten the liberties of other people if you agree then we both agree that the principle of criminalizing certain behaviors in defense of the people is well within the rights of government duties even when to not criminalize that behavior would result in greater harm to the people
gt possess all rights and the government has none no one else has right to control even one second of my life how very anarchist of you what happens when you decide to impose your will upon somebody else unjustly does the government have the right to control second of your life in that case

good writing the perl section was hilarious lisp section good also think the guy kind of lost it when talking about python enough to make me think that perhaps he hasn really used it for anything substantial significant whitespace became such non issue for me after writing couple of hundred lines that have hard time believing that it still bothers people saying the community is frosty is also something that doesn gel with my experience in fact reading through the archives of various python language mailing lists am impressed by the candour and sense of humour displayed by many of the community mainstays about ruby beating python stealing it thunder or it users think that either inaccurate or irrelevant perhaps both the kind of people that make the python community what it is are the same kind of people that would never could never switch to ruby because ruby has lot more of the proverbial whale guts on it shoes than the article admits people are sold on this idea of rails which ve never even looked at if web application framework is the source of the greatest influx of ruby coders wouldn be surprised if the average quality of ruby code was very low this is another reason to stick with python people pick it for the right reasons when searching for code samples to get feel for how implement some algorithm often search for python code snippets regardless of the language am working in because my level of confidence in the quality of your average python program is very high
gt parent authority over child is predicated on the assumption that the parent has more knowledge wisdom and maturity than the child such is not the case between government officials and private citizens there can be no reasonable assumption of greater knowledge wisdom or especially maturity on the part of government officials so you don think most government officials are more qualified for their positions than the average citizen wow who have you been voting for also what do you make of the fact that even in the there are an unusual amount of political families which produce public servants the adams http en wikipedia org wiki family the harrison http en wikipedia org wiki harrison_family family the taft http en wikipedia org wiki taft_family family the bush http en wikipedia org wiki bush_family family the kennedy http en wikipedia org wiki family among others http en wikipedia org wiki list_of_u so much for the cross section of society
this might be true for negative votes might be good but not interesting to me but positive votes shouldn suffer from this probably few people around who think it is crap but want to see more stuff like this
my only experience with lisp is the first several chapters of the gentle introduction but from reading the article it seems that what you should really do is learn lisp personally just started learning python and am going through all my old textbooks from engineering school and solving all the problems in python for fun but think the article was much more praiseful of lisp than ruby
excellent point think that was very well written and though out piece

gt when we elect our leaders we are not empowering them to tell us what to do we are empowering them to do our will believe that is convenient half truth americans tell themselves when they go to the voting booth which is at odds with reality elected representatives hold many positions which are against the wills of their constituents and they often change their minds on positions at various points during their tenure the more accurate explanation would be that americans vote for people who they think are best qualified for the job gt wary of the implications of thinking of our representatives as being in parent child relationship with us that very american of you as it signals deep distrust of authority americans are curious bunch in this regard because their very existence is of conflicted nature one the one hand to acknowledge that government is absolutely necessary when their most precious interests are threatened and on the other hand to vehemently object to government intervention in their affairs when it even smells like judgement on their behavior regardless of how valid the intervention might be almost like spoiled children when things are going great they can be bothered with suggestions from mama amp papa when things start going badly mama amp papa can get there quick enough but enough of the parent child analogy according to the scores ve obviously moved noone to consider the idea beyond reactionary behavior

thats great idea would love to see this implemented
indeed on top of that the people who designed common lisp weren trying to solve the same kind of problems that most hackers today are interested in cl is not all that great at networking interacting with the os or string processing for real world example consider the task of converting an arbitrary object foo into string in ruby foo to_s there no built in function for this in common lisp it not especially hard to write generic to do this for every type it makes sense for but discovering that it neccessary is bit annoying add up few annoying things and they become barrier to entry yes know there are libraries for doing all of this cl ppcre can do perl style regular expression matching faster than perl can program in lisp almost every day

try it with also keep in mind that the programs used here are not applications they re implementations of algorithms higher level languages tend to show their value with large and complex programming tasks in part because they re less error prone programmers tend to write the same number of errors per line no matter what language they re using therefore reduction in the line count tends to produce reduction in the error count think in this context it accurate to call something like writing loop that runs in time when you could have written one that runs in time an error do you see where going with this

gt but thats not what you said you said never said pica said also talking about higher level languages in general vs java and the like not just ml vs it always dependent on the quality of code my point is that the expressiveness of the language tends to affect the quality of the code such that everything else being equal an application written in higher level language will be better quality being better quality tends to mean that it will run faster and crash less in this context mean languages with first class functions and automatic memory management most of these are also dynamically typed ml being notable exception

forgive me for being practical of all the languages discussed the one that promises to pay the bills for the rest of this decade and probably all of the next is java bear in mind only started programming years ago first with gl and then perl btw agree with comments about the latter and cpan even if you have to hack module what starting point other than the above ve only gotten paid for php and python regarding the latter like to see its similarities with javascript its ok to mention now because of ajax played up more in terms of enabling more tightly integrated client and server web development platform as for and lisp both would provide good foundation not unlike learning latin though rather than learning lisp inclined to dabble with ruby largely based on this article while waiting for arc

this could not be any more wrong every now and again you hear someone complaining about the difficulty of parsing you will probably also have heard that templates are turing complete the two statements are of course linked no they aren the example given has no parsing problems and parsing happens long before template instantiation these problems are entirely unrelated the following code is valid but will never compile no it not valid code you don have to read the standard but at least ask someone before you complain that templates should be able to see the future the standard gives suggested template instantiation limit of if you don like it you can increase it with flag to your compiler of course in this case the user apparently wants something like infinite not arbitrarilty high infinite instantiation depth there is no programming language that could compile anything similar to this even ones with unlimited polymorphic recursion in fact forever lt gt value is very much undefined do you complain when you computer can divide by

you know hate to say it but there is nugget of truth in there children will test limits and it is necessary when in battle of will with your children to win to ensure the child feels the strength of your resolve as well as the strength of your love it does lead to to the kind of relaxed parenting described where children do as you ask without arguing but do do not have to do it with violence the trick is emotional connection getting thier attention and you can do that without beating them good god switch at months old that child abuse any way you slice it

think perhaps the negative reactions are because people are not reading it thoroughly the author clearly states on several occasions to train with tiny thumps and calm voice proactively discomfort is not violence this strategy is going to be less uncomfortable in the long run than the people that discipline after the fact like the core ideas of this article very much such as proactive training finding them neither bizarre nor sadistic the biggest problem with it is the use of switch the switch should be replaced by something less overtly mean if slight pain is never an option which do understand another way to communicate with the non speaking child must be used not as easy as it sounds or it would have been discovered many years ago think the rest of the advice holds also the negative horse and buggy comments are typical of younger people that haven yet learned that old and traditional don necesarily equal bad and may on few occasions be better

there nugget of truth in most crazy rants so what of that is crazy ass shit very very rarely get in battle of wills with my child and yes he well behaved and no don hit him think if battle of wills is an issue for you you re doing something wrong the reason btw that children test limits is that they are not well defined my child knows exactly where they are and rarely if ever tests them with me he tests them with his grandmother though all the time know why she doesn define them well that means he constantly thinking about which way he can bend them well she did it with me so why not him some things never change

utterly charming sketchbook diary of her trip to children book conference in new york
it seems to me that this indicates an opportunity home schooling does better than normal schooling despite the fact that home schooling parents don on average have detailed subject knowledge and despite the economies of scale that school brings this would seem to mean that better for profit school could be done then parents don have to home school the kids get the benefits and the founders of the school get rich to parents here assuming that there was school that got kids through much more content much faster than usual how much would you pay to send your kid there
sent this email to the author of the article you make an excellent observation google current method of observing the content of the net absolutely does have large effect on the behavior of website owners the coworker who showed me your article noted that this is sociological application of something like the heisenburg uncertainty principle which says that it is impossible to simultaneously know the momentum and position of particle and that by attempting to observe one the observer changes the other you and he seem to think that this is structural problem but believe it is not were the cameraman in your post game example invisible or from the crowd he would have no effect on the crowd even if he were distinguishable as cameraman if he turned the camera away from boorish people then boorish behavior would not be as favored by the filmed mass google presently uses fairly crude instrument to observe website it looks at links and at the textual content of the site and finally it probably does some back end number crunching to make sure that someone does not just rip long chunks of text from other sites it does not attempt to get input from human users which would catch most such sites very quickly reddit digg del icio us and several other such sites in the interest of disclosure am writing one in my off time each make some attempt at allowing individuals to vote on webpages rating their content they do not presently have the scale that google does but if implemented and scaled properly believe they could be far more resistant to boorishly designed webpages than google is at present and that the aggregate behavior of the web would be accordingly far more restrained with the proper observational instrument winning the race for pagerank becomes identical with creating webpages that are useful to people and then very large number of very tacky people will have to find something else to do with their time this depends on the somewhat suspect assumption that there are not enough tacky website readers to support all of the current crop of junk website publishers

um did you even read the article lot of the advice is really pretty good even if not entirely in line with the modern laissez faire approach to parenting gt what has the father learned that little johnny is just strong willed child that children go through unpleasant stages that it is sometimes very miserable embarrassing thing to be parent that one has to watch kid every minute and put things out of his reach that the only things kids understand are force and anger all of which are false it be nice to believe that loving child means never having to touch them but as the article points out laid back discipline means that at some point the parent will have to resort to grabbing to press home point isn it better to inflict small pain when you re clearheaded and the matter is trivial rather than lot when you re upset and the disobedience is more serious
this sounds like very good idea to sort out content and not be too granular

this has been thought of before it is known as private school ve been in it all my life currently in college school is fundamentally not profitable enterprise even if you can get several hundred sets of parents to pay year and they won pay much more than that for anything below college and they certainly won pay even that if you have more than several hundred kids you still operate at loss because you have to pay teachers enough to compete with neighboring schools and you have to buy equipment computers desks blackboards land buildings it ends up that you have to do hell of lot of fundraising to cover your expenses exceeding tuition and schools often take out mortgages private schools are better than public schools but not very much better they still give you orders and you still only succeed if you realize that the point is to take the orders

myron lieberman public education an autopsy http www amazon com gp product glance amp has some things to say about this not all of which can remember for example private schools are forced to operate in basically the same framework as public schools in terms of hours spent in classes and graduation requirements and such also in most places parents whose children go to private schools still must pay full taxes that pay for the public schools so the system isn very fair to private schools and most private schools aren for profit

believe the experience of reddit clannishness is caused by design flaws in reddit no tags global ranking no tags means that there is only like don like don care in the list of voting options and also requires things like programming reddit com if we could tag things then it would be extremely easy to say avoid guy kawasaki articles or politics or whatever it would also take some of the pressure off titles if you see that an article is titled the worst idea ever and is tagged politics you know lot more than merely the title the second flaw is arguably worse the currency of reddit is pretty much global ranking whether it is of articles or of your account while there must be how fit this article is for you number to make the recommended page reluctantly assuming the links are not random users don see it this means that intra reddit community formation is very hard and goes against human intuition on how groups work if submit say haskell paper it will probably get middling score at best it will be rated down by whatever spammer is pushing an article at the moment few of my less tolerant lisp bretheren and who knows who else while the middling score is an accurate representation of the reception of the link by the community as whole if every one of the people who are interested in haskell thought it was great then would call the submission towering success by the same token am only slightly interested in the fact that some random redditor voted site up but there are people whose up vote would mean absolutely want to read the article and am rather likely to vote it up if reddit had this then you would tend to experience less clannishness think

well it good thing that of children are as well behaved as yours from what it sounds like you ve been able to define limits with your child which is exactly what this article advocates setting limits and being consistent this sort of advice is better suited for parents with less understanding in this area for instance the mother of chocolate milk kid http video google com videoplay docid
that is truly horrible essay there is no argument in it beyond post hoc ergo prompter hoc for instance it claims that poverty declined between and which is true but the big decline started in before johnson took office every other statistic in the essay is like that it claims some metric improved during the great society period and takes it for granted that the great society caused that metric to improve with no effort whatsoever to actually demonstrate causal relationship or even determine whether it changed the overall trend in the case of head start he doesn even bother to show that there was any lasting improvement the mere fact that the program is politically popular is deemed sufficient evidence in its favor in short ick very very bad article feel dumber for having read it

bit tired of the same complaints about public education don know how it is in the us but most of those countries that did better than the us at educating their children according to the reports have also public systems many people seem to have the idea that whatever is public can be good not going to get into whether it possible to do better for profit or by homeschooling one own children what is clear is that it possible to do better by using tax supported public school system just like there is it doesn have to suck

try it is very practice
rinsing child mouth with soap is legally regarded as child abuse at least in the state of oregon and child care providers are legally bound to report all kinds of child abuse

about money agree put it like think that it appreciation that important usually the easiest way to acknowledge appreciation towards someone in work life is to pay accordingly in hard cash there are other ways too like in the open source world where your talents are appreciated by showing interest and respect instead of money but money is the least unambiguous don mean to imply that you do what you love partly because you need others appreciation you just have to get feedback that you re as good as you think you are appreciation in this sense is about knowing you re on the right track it about succeeding globally it converting your being good at into something that concrete if you have business you know your works and skills must be appreciated by looking at the incoming cashflow anything you know will directly translate into cash if you re employed looking at your salary will tell you how much your employer appreciates your work if you write floss software for yourself you get to appreciate yourself as soon as the software really works and you get the job done more of the same if there while community thinking you re really smart programmer embracing and using your software on the other hand if you do what you don love lot of money will motivate you only temporarily and you re probably not going to be success anyway conversely if you re paid too little but have lots of fun hacking on something you love to do you can shine for while just because you love it but the lack of appreciation money will eventually bite you off you can also be paid too much in which case you also know your employer doesn know what you do you only need to get paid enough with respect to the level of appreciation you deserve beyond that level it the non material things that matter the most most hackers agree that they don do what they do for money though it important to get enough money to keep things fair

good article though disagree with the author of perl marketing seems to me that perl really took off as vehicle for cgi programming and then cgi programmers started using it for other things of course realize that perl was being used prior to cgi and on the culture thing if he thinks things are bad with python which really ve not noticed much though ve not been immersed like the author well then just check out comp lang perl misc you see individuals who run their own consulting businesses on that newsgroup that directly flame other posters as idiots and so forth so believe the perl culture to be much harsher than python and yet it has in terms of jobs on dice com been much greater success

hear hear obviously it can be done better went to school in canada and for the most part was very happy with the experience we didn have tonnes of homework and creativity wasn stomped on but we had normal classes tests assignments etc public schooling doesn have to be bad regarding home schooling while obviously loving parent can do well and the fact that it one to one give or take versus one to thirty is going to have some benefit there is dark side too though without some kind of controls it may lead to child missing out on the education that is its right not to mention indoctrination think creationism vs evolution
oh and what wanted to say is that perhaps the focus on getting into good university is skewing things somewhat teaching students that gaming the system is more important than learning in canada the universities are of varying quality but not to the degree found in the us the whole sat prep and advanced placement stuff doesn occur either and yet it still possible to get into an ivy league school but think that whole sickness is tougher to solve than just improving the quality of public education

gt writing these programs left me progressively less satisfied with perl larger project size seemed to magnify some of perl annoyances into serious continuing problems the syntax that had seemed merely eccentric at hundred lines began to seem like nigh impenetrable hedge of thorns at thousand more than one way to do it lent flavor and expressiveness at small scale but made it significantly harder to maintain consistent style across wider code base and many of the features that were later patched into perl to address the complexity control needs of bigger programs objects lexical scoping use strict etc had fragile jerry rigged feel about them gt these problems combined to make large volumes of perl code seem unreasonably difficult to read and grasp as whole after only few days absence also found was spending more and more time wrestling with artifacts of the language rather than my application problems and most damning of all the resulting code was ugly this matters ugly programs are like ugly suspension bridges they re much more liable to collapse than pretty ones because the way humans especially engineer humans perceive beauty is intimately related to our ability to process and understand complexity language that makes it hard to write elegant code makes it hard to write good code gt with baseline of two dozen languages under my belt could detect all the telltale signs of language design that had been pushed to the edge of its functional envelope by mid was thinking there has to be better way and began casting about for more elegant scripting language http www linuxjournal com article

that list of bad things about modern kids is it just me that thinks that this is how kids always were gt the children teach are ahistorical they have no sense of how past has predestined their own present limiting their choices shaping their values and lives is this surprising when you watch history unfold you realise what happens with cause and effect if you ve watched less history unfold then you re going to be less aware of this gt the children teach are indifferent to the adult world this defies the experience of thousands of years close study of what big people were up to was always the most exciting occupation of youth but nobody wants to grow up these days and who can blame them some referential evidence of this would not go amis gt the children teach have poor sense of the future of how tomorrow is inextricably linked to today as said before they have continuous present the exact moment they are at is the boundary of their consciousness anyone that has spent time with toddler will know that they really do have no conception of causality is it such huge leap to believe that you gradually gain better understanding of these things as you get older gt the children teach are materialistic following the lead of schoolteachers who grade everything and television mentors who offer everything in the world for free firstly grading is not about materialism it is about competition secondly if everything in the world were free why would this make people materialistic people are concerned with having things which are scarce if things are in abundance there is no longer perceived advantage in having it as any kid with baseball cards will tell you

shot smalltalk with ruby just to watch it die
the fact is for most languages learning the core syntax and standard library doesn actually take very long from what ve read perl is an exception here but have no first hand experience so switching to new language isn actually too much work and the more languages you know the more likely you will have the right tool for any given job gt really wonder why people obsess over syntactic sugar and core language features when library and system support are far more important for getting work done personally think that core language features are very important otherwise we all be programming in assembly but even assuming they re not if there really amazing library in ruby for doing something you want to do and perl doesn have it what do you do finally learning new languages is really interesting it expands your understanding of programming makes you better programmer in the languages you already know and puts you in better position to judge new languages as they emerge also it just plain fun
if you know and love perl why switch assume you are decade long perl hacker like the author claims to be there is nothing in python or ruby that will be an improvement over that much experience had the same experience which the author mentioned after six years of perl programming where perl was the language used for programming of the time picked up ruby in about days after week felt more comfortable with ruby than ever was with perl now when look at perl code it just painful and was big perl fan in the past where you can literally crank out code on the fly with no references no programming manuals etc think that the main point in perl always had to refer back to the manuals granted they were good manuals because there were lots of things that weren consistent or easy to guess with ruby my first guess about how something in the library works is correct at least of the time it an incredible boost to productivity

was using this as specific example of the general principle that having teacher is helpful in many subjects am not aware of high school or for that matter any school using principia but regardless of what book you choose to learn from and the selection of good texts targeted at high school students is extremely thin in my experience it is helpful to have teacher tutor this is not merely because the teacher waters things down but because good teacher can see what mistakes you are making and very good teacher will know how the sort of mistake you made correlates to what pedagogy is most effective for you in addition many students will develop bad approximations that yield correct results in specific domain eg sin in radians and think that is the correct answer in general teachers can catch that bit better than book can because they have runtime information as an example of case in which teacher seems to be necessary used to do workshop in which would help smart high school student derive trigonometry from the counting numbers and the successor operation it may be possible but is certainly very hard to get student to do that on their own

plenty of women don have periods or have them sporadically especially athletes with little body fat but would think that generally when someone doesn realize she pregnant for so long she overweight enough not to notice the belly and having irregular periods to boot certainly it not usually someone wearing size as for denial olegk does that mean her teammates who didn notice her pregnancy while changing in the locker room before practice were also in denial that said wouldn trust the reporters to get the story straight either especially considering how sensational it is

good point suppose that the idea behind montessori education give children access to many different interesting things to learn and allow them to choose that way if they don enjoy one thing there are other equally stimulating things available however that approach ensures that the kids are still doing something to improve their minds no matter what they choose doubt anyone looks back on their life and says wish played more video games

pretty sure that the author is not arguing against kids learning long division but rather against going to law school just in case when law is not enjoyable or interesting to you the cost of choosing to do the wrong thing that you enjoy modulo stupid things like watching tv is small but the cost of doing things that you do not enjoy is very large on the other hand it is hell of lot easier to go from math to comparative lit than from comp lit to math so maybe the best heuristic is to do the hardest thing you enjoy instead of the thing you enjoy most not sure

after you read bit of his stuff gatto seems to be bit of crank unless you embrace conspiracy theories the idea that modern schools are designed to instill obedience in the population seems to be just another one of those wacky conspiracies it does until you reflect on one fact broad category of knowledge has been almost entirely removed from the modern school curriculum how to reason and persuade logic and dialectic also called rhetoric are no longer routinely taught even though for millenia it was thought to be critical for public political life in democracies and republics how many of us can routinely spot false dilemma or even circular reasoning when it is not blatant can you never mind us being able to construct logical argument or spotting some of the less common logical fallacies very few of us have any training how many of us know the different parts to putting together persuasive argument we are taught crippled version of it in composition classes true but the most important parts we are not taught but left to discover on our own if you want to live an uncrippled life try the art of deception for logic and cicero works on rhetoric

do dynamic languages scare you or do you have some argument that would lead to your conclusion above which you don wish to share with us find working in dynamic language to be enabling when compared to statically typed language mind you most of my work is still done in java but do some ruby and some rails on the side every now and then
nah it the usual dynamic languages are just scripting toys and hardcore since know java which is amusing since most of the really advanced concepts contructs in programming continuations full closures first class everything big time meta programming etc are best found in dynamic languages disclaimers cut my teeth on assembler and ve logged lots of time with especially with the stl and some of the wackier template voodoo so not offering an uninformed opinion yeah know there is some degree of support for some of these things in statically typed languages

right on learning guides could turn wikipedia into an incredibly powerful tool for self directed learning community dedicated to providing them wouldn be too hard to create either most interesting careers have some form of guide floating around already the hard work is distilling the guides and pruning the generalities it doesn have much of buisness model but does helping people really need business model thinking smaller nobody can walk up to school and say want to be biologist and have someone lead them down the path to biology every step we take in learning whether in school or on our own is in chunks that what wikipedia and the web in general already does very well provide the chunks and the connections between them if my children want to become actors don need to know every step they ll have to take right now just need to know that an actor has to be able to read so we work on that maybe tomorrow we ll get to stage directions but right now where we go in the next five weeks isn critical
of course people are going to be able to read algolesque languages quickly most programmers have been required to learn at least one if not three or four thus if you know it will be quick to pick up java or python lisp is completely different however if you know lisp you should be able to pick up scheme or ml or number of functional programming languages quickly forth is another programming language that takes some time to get used to it doesn make forth confusing just different forth is possibly my favorite language that don use regularly that perl is different isn problem however it is prickly annoyance that it not internally consistant
but you know whom really feel sorry for bet there some poor family in say alabama whose house burned down last year they lost everything they had too but because it didn happen in way that touched the hearts of americans nobody going to demand they get big handouts it like after september so sick of the september victim families what because your husband or daughter or father died in particular way that gives you right to dictate civic spending again the one really feel sorry for is someone whose husband got hit by truck on september sorry no multimillion dollar payout for you nobody going to ask you what you think of the olympics bid too bad your loved one died in mundane way hope you don want to close down the road for all eternity and build memorial
the curious part about this though is that even if ruby and perl have identical expressive power one can be more productive in the language that is more consistent where the syntax and libraries are easier to understand and remember
look sorry about the hurricane sorry we didn rescue everyone as fast or as well as we should have glad we gave you place to stay for while but it been six months how far along are you with putting your life back together it too bad you lost your house but that doesn entitle you to free government support for the rest of your life

agree with steve on this one refactoring was certainly one of those big paradigm shifts with me as was ruby ve noticed that in all aspects of programming just worry less with ruby refactoring included the crux of the article is that ruby is fundamentally different from java so it easy to see that the refactoring designed for java won matter that much in ruby but that not to say that we don refactor in ruby we do we just don have book that gives them names yet prepared to wager that somebody will write refactoring in ruby book any second now
don step in the sour grapes
it is obvious to me but only in retrospect that is as soon as saw the article title it dawned on me sure that it the same way for many of us out here it doesn mean that we are dumb or naive or anything it just means we never considered the possibility you can think about everything in lifetime now please get off your high horse what waste of my time it is to come accross stupid rants like this one when trying to find some real discussion

gt very much afraid that on the evidence you ve presented in the cumulation of your posts on reddit this respect doesn come over very well more than once including in the present instance you ve demonstrated contempt for arguments you don agree with apparently purely because you disagree with them apparently to you being disrespectul means disagreeing with you gt if you hit another adult it is unequivocally illegal if you do so whilst in position of power over that other adult it is torture and against international though apparently not american law what is different about someone who has not yet reached majority that makes such behaviour acceptable in that case in the adult world the question of degree never arises it the fact of being in position of power that elevates the offence not the severity yet you argue for division between physical chastisement and abuse based on degree with no regard for the very powerful position of parents over their children yes do because you are using an extremist position instead of just using common sense light physical discipline never hurt anyone infact it likely helped many people because it led them to do the right things just because certain people take it over the top doesn mean that physical discipline in itself is wrong yes the parents have powerful position over children that is the nature of things parents exist to raise their children up providing for them and teaching them very effective way of teaching them what is wrong is to show that there are consequences for doing what is wrong often getting good spanking leaves lot more of an impact don want to do that again than simply just scolding child
like said you ve taken your singular experience with physical discipline and are now trying to apply it to every other situation dealing with physical discipline that is not an objective way of looking at things just because my ford truck breaks down it doesn mean that all ford trucks break down
eek that kinda scary yeah wasn really familiar with rhetoric until happened to take course on it here at berkeley and believe berkeley is one of the few places that still have rhetoric department quite eye opening indeed and especially in the modern world where the media dominates political thought it seems like we need rhetoric more than ever people need to know when cheap tricks are being used by politicians to skirt around the issues this is quite scary indeed and just finished reading
gt after all they only devote their professional lives to determining those kinds of question it not as though they do anything important yeah have to say so its just not using common sense soap isn going to hurt anyone have no emotional or mental scars because of it did learn what was appropriate to say around different people though like told you earlier just because some parents do use discipline methods like this abusively doesn mean the methods themselves are wrong
here nugget of truth parents who have lived for or years generally know more than the children that they are raising if little kid my parents aren going to let me walk up to fire and stick my hand in it they are going to teach me that doing so is bad thing and can really hurt me the same goes with anything else if doing something that can hurt me or others my parents can teach me that those things are bad and an effective way of conveying that sometimes its not appropriate for every situation is light physical discipline so you can take two approaches here you can let your child do things that might hurt them or others and the child may or may not learn from them or you can teach them from the beginning that those things aren good not advocating this teaching style hardly even glanced over the article do think kids need to learn lot of things on their own and them becoming like mindless drones does no one any good but still don think there is anything wrong in and of itself for light physical discipline

gt yes you were wrong then and you re wring now the use of humiliation and degrading treatment is abusive in itself because it is done from position of power and might its not humiliation and degrading treatment unless you make it so gt more subtly though it also teaches children that they are powerless subject to the whims of whoever is bigger and stronger than them at the time and that there nothing they can do about it actually it teaches children that their parents are authority figures to them and it teaches them that certain actions are negative

better than being dead that is actually not trivial question kids who are born to mothers who cannot get abortions have all sorts of social problems crime rate lower earnings etc an argument can be made that they will not have substantially better life than they would if they were dead and very strong argument can be made that other people are far better off with abortion see for example freakonomics for the effect of legalized abortion on crime rates in the us

gt intrigued given that you seem to think fetuses have some sort of personhood would you support banning drug alcohol tobacco use in expectant mothers its probably good idea as drug alcohol tobacco use can end up really messing baby up sure there are medical limits as to what will and won affect an infant in the womb and that probably where the legal restrictions should be set gt should they be forbidden to engage in athletic activities that would tend to induce miscarriage that good question as far as know there never been restrictions on stuff like that before know when my mother had my younger brother her doctor made her stay in bed for like the last weeks of her pregnancy that really comes down to judgement call not sure that women should be legally restricted from engaging in physical activities while pregnant maybe certain ones but not all women are the same and different physical actions will affect their pregnancies differently there not any question about it when it comes to abortion that abortion will kill the baby regardless

there big difference between learning basic life skills like arithmetic and going to med school think that all education boils down to keeping one options open for example learning how to spell is necessary to be valuable member of modern society child who cannot write will still have the option of working in restaurant as career but most parents want there children to have broad choices and many opportunities unfortunately some are overzealous and don know when to stop forcing education on their children the coerced child then loses the real opportunities of full life many of my classmates have the same ridiculous mindset as applied for year long study abroad remember one classmate asked me why would you want to live in japan for whole year was astonished and replied why wouldn you the classmate response was something about friends and work think that most people are miserable because of lack of courage and also the keeping one options open mentality miserable in my last semester of university am taking many classes for the sole purpose of graduation so have another months of suffering to keep my options open for after graduation what opportunities am losing because choose to study so hard it sad to think that ll never know

actually yes live in pierre sd and while gov mike rounds is personal friend of mine and mostly try and stand by him even though my decidedly libertarian political views don agree with his this bill is rediculous it all dog and pony show to get sd in the spotlight since sd seems to be the most random anonymous state and to get the roe vs wade back into the spotlight it actually bit pathetic how far an entire state will go to get some recognition every daily paper in sd currently has an article about sean penn visiting few towns in sd had drink with him in bar in madison actually big deal back to the point it bit barbaric that the bill specifically bans abortions for incest rape situations the day after pill is the solution they say the most obvious thign of all this bill won in any way prevent sd women from having abortions sd women have been going to nebraska for long time now because abortions have always been cheaper there since sd taxed them like much legislation this bill if it is even upheld is going to be pretty ineffective at solving the problem it set out to solve

was interpreting the word materialism in the straightforward way as referring to the desire for material physical goods to me maybe just me materialism conjurs images of sports cars plasma tv and the like competition makes me think of olympic athletes entrepreneurs and so on accept materialism is subset of competition but not vice versa imo calling grading materialism is dishonest in similar way to calling copyright infringement theft regarding your meat analogy no would not call the grading of meat as materialism the aspiration to eat the best cuts of meat could be classed as such but not the actual grading itself having said that it is certainly closer to materialism than grading exam scripts since it does at least have something to do with material goods regarding the porsche analogy would say that the statement gpa would be more accurate if the word materialistic was removed entirely the word value suffices
removed
possibly but if that is the case then have never come across well written math text and believe me have tried many personaly think that producing well written math text is basically impossible since every student has problems at different places some people can see through algebraic derivations very quickly some need every line presented and others can do it as long as the trick is hinted at some people are very quick to map the problem into geometry and use symmetry arguments others just can see it even when the diagrams are drawn some people are very happy generalising the problem using abstract algebra others aren the problem is that these skills are not strongly correlated to each other the student who is strong at algebra may be weak at geometry and ok at abstract algebra since any maths topic may well require all of these skills it starts to become very difficult to create one size fits all solution
at the risk of stating the obvious this would have much larger impact than the russian default of

what he done seems to be first approximation to constraint programming http en wikipedia org wiki naive prolog program would run through an exponential search tree in this case backtracking when some constraints are broken even if you don know the rest of the variables will prune the search tree quite lot of course there lot more to constraint programming than that part of which is rearranging the order of evaluating properties which as he mentions at the end brings the evaluation time down tenfold all this seems pretty ad hoc the way talking about it but constraint programming is actually proper field of study with systematic formal basis seems almost like greenspun tenth rule http en wikipedia org wiki greenspun s_tenth_rule in reverse common lisp program that contains an ad hoc informally specified implementation of half of constraint programming who have thunk it
yes it could stand an ignore filter
it like the teacher with the tie over their shoulder they look like they ve been running so they must be really busy only bring that up because it was sketch on stand up show can remember which one to be honest but it was funny at the time anyway quite agree with the not working too hard aspect of this you gotta have some time to yourself or life is just pants

completely agree as soon as saw the new site went yow is this for real liked their website when it was more amateurish you know because it just looked more um fun dunno it just gave me the feeling that the people are into python because they like it not because they have to this corporate style website makes it look as if python is business populated by phbs who leverage the productivity synergy of their mindless employee drones for operational competencies or something
rom esv for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth for what can be known about god is plain to them because god has shown it to them for his invisible attributes namely his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly perceived ever since the creation of the world in the things that have been made so they are without excuse for although they knew god they did not honor him as god or give thanks to him but they became futile in their thinking and their foolish hearts were darkened claiming to be wise they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal god for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles therefore god gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves because they exchanged the truth about god for lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the creator who is blessed forever amen
that helped me waste good few minutes of time although can even cheat and find the answer for the last one
why am not its because only really visit sites that are community based rss is one way street of information there no discussion back and forth between the readers and the author and there no discussion among the readers themselves its just boring way to use the internet in my opinion and it doesn really harness its strengths
this is nice piece of technique but on my planet people who whish to have cooked peeled potato peel the potato before cooking it
nice to see it get updated to look more professional but have to agree with the others here the site looks more stuffy than fun wonder who they are trying to target

like much legislation this bill if it is even upheld is going to be pretty ineffective at solving the problem it set out to solve on the contrary this bill has better chance at curbing sd women right to abortions than any previous legislation precisely because it does bring roe wade back into the spotlight think it unlikely that the decision is overturned but the only way for sd to prevent abortions in nebraska is bill like this
political commentary
somehow not impressed by what most people think ve seen way too much crap music on mtv and in the hit charts for that
plus ycombinator hyping
wouldn we be better served by addressing why women are having abortions and not whether they can just by reading some of the comments it appears we all can accurately guess as to the major reasons women decide to terminate pregnancy low income single no support group so rather than debate over whether fetus is life or why more people don choose adoption couldn we instead look at improving the situation for single mothers so the decisions they do make would be less out of desperation just thought
think he is talking about peeling the potatoes before boiling them there isn much sense in cooking potatoe putting new kettle on and then peeling the cooked potatoe
don know that my specific anecdotes are relevent but did post the curriculum below if you are actually interested it has been followed successfully at all levels of math and science
if you are interested here is the overview page http opal cabochon com stevey blog rants
here genuine question should legislation be based on the likelihood of damage to citizens or on principles or morals or ethics or whatever if it is based on likelihood how likely can something be and still be permissible as disclaimer pretty religious and make personal choices based almost solely on principles not on statistics but think legislation should be more grounded in data for example don drink because alcohol is dangerous and drunk driving should be illegal because the likelihood of an accident increases xx for drivers with bal over this is relevant if abortion increases likelihood of miscarriage to or if drinking increases odds of birth defect by xx or if marathon running increases odds of miscarriage by yy should they be illegal
lisp has some continuation based web frameworks too
know it like western cooking show with the enthusiasm of kare kano plus cg demo and more overlaid text than you can shake stick at ve never done it quite like they show here but the general idea is similar peeling cooked potato is easy you just have to not scald your hands so you run the sucker under cold tap water and shell it with paring knife
could we get past all these rediculous this is old postings if people didn like it it wouldn have gotten modded up who cares how old it is
here review of the book that brings out some interesting points http www denverseminary edu dj articles php
well if it that old then it not hot anymore hehe but ok ve got your point
and they want your full name why
look at the rise and subjective fall of dynamic languages like php python perl and ruby on rails
tried it was one of the few books in my life that started reading and didn finish learned around languages that way so am sure it isn the general programming part of the book that bored me it must be something perl specific think it has something to do with different cultures in linguistics they seem to admire complicated languages tolkien designed his elven languages not to be very simple larry wall is linguist too and computer science where simplicity is the ultimate goal
tcl always seemed quite nice to me after having read philip greenspun tcl for web nerds http philip greenspun com tcl incidentally the lack of strong benevolent dictator is one of the main reasons think lisp has floundered in recent years
yeah would like to ignore all messages matching why eo mod down too
you are right people outside the tcl comunity may think it strange language is so damaged for the lack of benevolent dictator but there is no way multi head design does not work what you get is averaging even worse when there is to do strong design decision and there is no agreement the result is often just don do nothing at all proof lack of first class dictonaries in tcl is incredible in but there were already arrays as collection of variables and nobody has the strength to remove them and do the right thing

the rebuttal focuses on few trivial points and ignores the real argument the christian bible is an incoherent mess there is no basis in reason or common sense for believing in its historical accuracy the best way to undermine people belief is for them to actually read the four gospels side by side
evidently not

one thing about the school system is that imo the teachers are not given the authority to be able to get anything done we us ians have the overiding belief that everyone has the same ability when in reality we don things you can say this belief in equal ability lumps together kids that want to learn with those that don care then then entire system gets pushed to the lowest common denominator then to make things worse the parents of the lowest performers complain the system isn fair but these same parents think that it not their responsiblity to help their own children it like people that are obese that want to be thin but won watch their diet or workout want my kid to be smart you the school system should make that happen these are most likely the same parents that complain their kids have too much homework it just another part of the it not my fault culture that has been create by american lawyers
interesting thanks for the link curious how it almost the opposite story of lee strobel it hard to tell from the wp article what kinds of points he actually makes in the book but certainly the ones put forward in the article are not all that persuasive john doesn cover the christmas story well no duh he was writing it years later presumably with the other gospels in front of him why would he cover the same ground over again john is more about philosophy than history anyways
it does look bit stuffy maybe they ll loosen it up bit after they hear enough complaints personally ve always thought that the vaults of parnassus was the site that most screamed for redesign think it an embarassment give the maintainers credit for all the work they do they ve certainly contributed more to the python community than have but don ever want my phbs to see the vop it looks like year old dungeons and dragons site prefer cpan look simple clean and functional the new python site will be boost to those of us trying to subvert our phbs by sneaking weird european possibly communist creepy perverted language into the office mean subvert our phbs by being productive which is what they pay us for
precisely
the legends of christianity are so deeply meshed into our daily american at least lives they exist almost as fact whether person is believer or not so if you aren christian you are just wrong and misguided or just haven happened to see the light yet many christians and non christians alike have hard time comprehending the simple fact that there is genuine belief and faith in more than just christ religious or not we all carry core understanding of something greater some seek and find explanations that satisfy them as to the nature of this power other are content with just wondering and the thrill of the search others just don care regardless no one person is wrong no one person is right does it matter that the gospels are mess and contradict themselves no faith is all that counts to christian just as impermanence matters to buddhist
on the other hand when does it become ok to start modding down dups after the third time its posted mean at some point it like yeah that was cool the first times it was posted to reddit but now don like it anymore simply because it keeps getting posted and it annoying

surely the point of any religion is about having faith that you re basic beliefs and tenets are true and not whether any particular book is line by line gospel so to speak think was fairly lucky to have standard catholic upbringing but one in which it was made clear that many of the stories in the bible were allegorical they were about making point not necessarily about being historically accurate as logical person was able to make my mind up that didn have the required belief to see it through the danger comes when religous tracts are drummed in as the only truth and people become brain washed to wider truths that goes for other religions equally as well as christian ones
sounds like he swallowed time management book the dilbert stuff is genuinely funny this just adds nothing
at the company work only people out of do really spend hours day on real work most of them spend hours on work and rest of the time pretend to be working now it obvious to me and how isn it obvious to the management to the bosses have no idea
it is better than being dead don know about that all those religious text keep talking about this amazing place called heaven heck would bet that fetus if it had the choice would rather go to heaven than earth mean if you come to earth you have already commited cardinal sin and then your chances of continuing to live in life of sin is high might as well cut your losses and head to heaven right away

that the first thing thought it seems like yet another lame geoblogging site think the only way this type of site would be useful is if you could organize your vacation photos on the map you could show an entire trip with markers and trails connecting the places and cities you ve visited and have your photo gallery actually show up on the location you took them that the only way would take the time to post anything on website it seems like you can sort of do it here but it would be cumbersome gotta think about what the user is getting out of it in flagr case not much and are they connected witih flickr

the author makes his case very well there probably is an over emphasis on the possibilities for refactoring that static types buy you but he doesn address several of the other features of mainstream java ides that are only possible because of static type information but which aren strictly anything to do with refactoring the most useful of these other feature are probably find usages go to declaration go to implementation and context sensitive code completion other java developers may have their own set of favourites all rely on static type data to work accurately you could get reasonable approximations with dynamic language though ve personally not seen anything cleverer than tags files but they ll lack the exactness you get by basing the searches on type information

there are ways to further prettify that code such as aligning columns with whitespace or adding dummy symbols but let take the first code fragment the prepare statement the only code there is the very first line for the next lines it as if someone spliced in xml but less verbose and very useful variant http homepages inf ed ac uk wadler papers xml essence xml essence pdf of xml so in evaluating that code one possible benchmark is how it would ve looked like in general programming language plus data language certainly anyone might object to the next stuff in upper case but that not actually code he wrote but rather automatically generated by lisp printed in uppercase he just illustrating this intermediate code just like someone decompiling target language to poke at its internals like surgeon pointing out cadaver guts to his peers while demonstrating technique that means that all his code is simple calls to prepare while the messy stuff is autogenerated by lisp that is common pattern macros contain messy plumbing code in order for you to write clean data driven syntax on top now we can click the link to his sourcecode which backs it all up it about lines it uses templating language which translates the simple data driven syntax that edi invented into lisp code which the lisp system understands one way to read it is to use built in lisp tools such as macroexpand which in fact edi did earlier when he showed the uppercase code is the sourcecode reinvention of constraint programming should it be done in prolog well certainly lisp is used to assimilate other styles perhaps stylized oop was invented by the smalltalk tradition but lisp stole it and made interesting improvements to the extent that alan kay claims that lisp oop book art of the metaobject protocol was the best book written in computing in ten years and edi weitz author of this article apparently stole perl regexes often outperforming perl http www weitz de cl ppcre performance to boot not to mention that lisp has its own constraint libraries http www cliki net screamer and as far as can tell lot http www jfsowa com krbook of important logic and knowledge representation work has been done with lisp keeping in mind not an expert if we look through norvig paradigms of ai programming we ll see bunch of prolog in lisp code intended to be embedded in lisp system after writing bunch of macros but he also listed apparently serious implementations of prolog using lisp syntax would some of the modern non lisp prologs be much faster at processing terabytes of data if you need something done in minutes perhaps and given such constraints that may be one factor causing you to choose non lisp prolog

the problem is that having their own personal faith and the freedom to talk about it and to engage in worship isn good enough for some many christians they want to change the law to match the bible so in that sense it is extremely important to know whether the bible is consistent reliable or meaningful and since it isn then it should not be used as the basis of laws for free open and rational society

tcl rocks tcl to scripting languages is what is to compiled languages simple small footprint least hairy implementation am not sure but ve got hunch that it is the most efficiently parsed scripting languages here are the top few points like about tcl lack of comma in list syntax ideal for sublanguages based on list expressions similar to lisp it simplicity it seems very easy to implement if some government bans all open source software have feeling that can write up my own tcl interpreter reasonably quickly the eval thingy is very powerful yet simple powerful enough to do anything we do with lisp macros simple enough for mechanical engineer like myself to understand its implementation there are plenty of ibraries extensions and wrapper generators making it easier to get common things done quickly the bad thing is that often forget to put the for rvalues similar to forgetting amp address of in but am happy to live with it

agree but imo it should be seen as some kind of poetry if you re audience does not have the relevant analytic framework to be able to comprehend the message then you have to speak in metaphors and seemingly vacuous or even contradictory phrases find that when you translate god as being something incorporating both humanity and the laws of physics things make lot of sense and often do not even sound controversial here my cribsheet god has eternal power physical laws have universal generality god has divine nature physical laws have beauty monotheism belief in the existence of gggggut divine truth scientific truth god created man laws of physics and appropriate boundary conditions created man whether it has any useful advice for modern science is debatable but since science is traditionally seen as directed acyclic graph of different disciplines it shouldn be expected to

have copy of aland synopsis of the four gospels which lays the four gospels side by side on page it illustrates quite clearly just how inconsistent the gospels are even in the first pages of each gospel there are explicitly contractictions and as they go forward they diverge more than they converge while faithful person will likely gloss over the contradictions and come up with all sorts of turgid twisting accounts to try to justify cover up problems an honest person with critical reading skills isn going to be able to do that there is an online synoptic gospel here which is interesting to use for comparisons http religion rutgers edu nt primer

excellent point at the risk of sounding cliche it all too true that christianity bases much of it future domination of hearts minds and souls on the fear factor christianity by accident or by design or both has created the perfect formula for religion and control of the masses they have the sole vehicle to god nasty little hell as punishment for those who don believe and the last minute save if you so choose to cave in to the fear and accept christ not to mention book that supposedly lays out all the rules like to believe that mankind in this age is re awakening to the realization that god self nature etc lives within us all and salvation is only as far away as accepting that fact through christ or through the winds blowing through the leaves of tree everyone has an equal shot
they scare me because every time work in them my time gets sucked up debugging typos and using runtime debuggers just to find out what type my objects are once the codebase has grown to half million lines of code or more can only imagine the pain dynamically typed objects are great in moderation and in tightly focused scopes
wanted to disprove that tcl is worse in every aspect than python and actually there are tons of things where tcl is superior just to mention one language flexibility python is not programmable like ruby and tcl for example you get what they want no switch case live with it no feature no way to change it from the script level
anything but hardcore just really lazy and don like digging through source code to discover what type of object method just returned and what it capable of nor do like spending couple hours only to realize typed udpate instead of update
because dynamic typing is great in moderation wouldn waste my time programming with pointers have no idea if you consider them typed nor do care

of course was forgetting about smalltalk so thanks for reminding me smalltalk does indeed have better implementation for method finding etc than tags files ianasp am not smalltalk programmer but as far as can tell it still not up to what the java ides can do though it probably close enough an awful lot of the time really wish that emacs could jump around ruby code as well as the smalltalk browser does to illustrate case where the browser falls down though you could try finding the definition of commonly overridden method like new for given class if you try to browse to the definition of generically named method like that you can get tens if not hundreds of potential answers returned with no indication of which is the right one if it not defined on the class itself then you ll have to resort to guessing at which one of the class superclasses it might be in or you have to manually navigate the class hierarchy looking for it in the case of new you might guess that it defined in the class class and look there but it not it actually in behaviour in squeak at least with static type information the ide would jump straight to the correct definition try it with tostring in intellij or whatever though at least the browser does it whole lot better than simply grepping through the entire codebase for occurrences of whatever you re looking for this sort of thing is all very well when you re seasoned expert you probably know almost instinctively where things are defined and can jump to the right place as quickly as an ide can but where the accurate part is huge advantage for those java ides is for people maintaining unfamiliar code suspect this is lot of people the easier it is to find the code you re looking for the faster you ll be able to do your job

assume that this is so that it is more accessible for students since translations are adequate for most student use have read matt and john in the original koine and parts of luke and mark and the translations are mostly just as useful knowing the nuances of the vocabulary is nice but it really doesn make huge difference most of the passages that are contradictory cannot be explained away by questions of translations for instance matthew luke are two totally inconsistent accounts of jesus genaeology and also go through the line of joseph who according to the faithful is not jesus father mark and it was the third hour and they crucified him john and about the sixth hour and he saith unto the jews behold your king but they cried out crucify him luke and when jesus had cried with loud voice he said father into thy hands commend my spirit and having said thus he gave up the ghost john when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost there are places where referring to the original greek can help but too often blaming problems on translations is just way to try to weasel out of problem that has nothing to do with translation issues
think it worth noting that combinator is only indirectly involved in these companies in for only few thousand dollars worth no less and further that they seem to be playing the numbers game more than the average vc firm investing little in large number of startups it only natural to expect that most of the companies in which they invest in will be duds presumably one big hit could pays for many failures and who knows with reddit they may already be ahead in the grand scheme of things but yeah thus far it makes me wonder what was on some of those applications granted it still early

gt the children teach are materialistic following the lead of schoolteachers who grade everything and television mentors who offer everything in the world for free describes the way teachers go about grading not grading in general why as student do have to rely on someone else to tell me whether anything do is good the way schools constantly judge everything and try to assign absolute values accurately reflects the business world but does not accurately reflect life materialism is one of the roots of schooling right now so it hard to say it doesn include competition rather than the other way around simple example why do go to school to learn why do need to learn to get better job why do need better job to get more stuff it very possible that larger group of people than am aware of don care about better jobs and more stuff but schools still broadcast that philosophy loud and clear if you don get good grades you won get into good college if you don get into good college you won get good job not going to die if get not going to die if work as janitor in factory somewhere but told all the way along that if these things happen failure and am doomed to unhappiness in this way materialism is stirred up in children as motivator and it just not healthy some of the most fulfilling lives ve read about were lived by the poorest materially of the poor who simply did what they loved if my children grow up to be turd farmers because kept them out of school but turd farming is their heart desire and they are happy doing it awesome

while really don agree with him posting that here what revisions are you talking about there so many uninformed statements made against christianity today one of them being the idea that the bible is heavily revised modern translations are based off of the oldest texts possible there have been no revisions you can compare the oldest texts with our latest translations and they are damn near the same as much as two different languages can be
was that really needed why are you going to make personal attack on him what does that add to the conversation but sure you ll get modded up and its okay because the writer that you made personal attack on is defending christianity

gt because in no way do religious fundamentalists constitute the main powerbase in the most powerful nation on earth today gt oh wait they do and they seem to be every bit as opposed to real religious freedom as the groups you cited alright let look at this realistically are people in america free to practice any religion they like yes are they being murdered by their own government due to their beliefs no please don even try and compare the current situation in america or any other nation with that of the soviet union or china its insulting the the millions of many different faiths who were murdered in cold blood in those nations for their beliefs
yeah totally agree with you its best to do what you want to do if you can at the same time support yourself and help others by providing services then that even better with you here in no way trying to say that materialism or anything like that is good in fact not making any normative judgements at all all am saying is that grading work is not materialism if memory serves from when was at school the procedure for maths was this be set some questions to answer on certain topic answer questions for every answer is assigned if it is correct or if it is wrong if it is nearly right some kind of symbol is assigned the sum of marks is written at the top can see that there may be various reasons why this might not reflect the true capacity of the student to do maths can see that this is not good indicator as his worth as human being can see that it might be demoralising can see that it might put him off maths can also see that the final number depends somewhat arbitrarily on what the teacher considers to be nearly right can see all this but all these flaws do not even resemble materialism because materialism is about the desire for material goods it may well be that schools promote an overly materialistic philosophy in america if this were the case then think that is bad thing but telling students whether their answers are correct or not isn desiring material goods it is about letting them know inaccurately perhaps how much they need to improve before they reach certain level of competency if it is final exam then it is telling whoever wants to know how competant the student is at solving typical problems as given in the syllabus the fact that the student may use that final number to gain material goods is immaterial so to speak to the nature of what the grade is the same grade could be used to get into university and then become an academic or it could be used to please his dad or it could be to prove he is smarter than his friends only one of these uses is materialistic and so doesn itself promote materialism any more than it promotes academia egoism or utilitarianism gt why as student do have to rely on someone else to tell me whether anything do is good you don but this is irrelevant think you are confusing materialism for moral objectivism

don particularly care for the rapture theory espoused in books like left behind but do suspect there are many people who honestly think the world would be better without christianity or other religions think they be in for shocking suprise when they realize that all of these people that once dealt with many of the world problems are simply gone mean you guys can bash christians all you want but know many who have given up their lives to serve people and cultures know of several who have died but its fun to make light of those people by sitting in our chairs ivory towers at home and typing on our keyboards about how worthless christianity is my point is don mock christianity if there are fundies that do more in week for other people than you do in an entire year it is the height of arrogance
matt and jacob begat joseph the husband of mary of whom was born jesus who is called christ luke jesus was supposed to be the son of joseph who was the son of heli who was the son of matthat who was the son of levi who was the son of melchi where does mary come into that reviewed the mark john crucifiction passages again and there is enough unclarity there that perhaps they are consistent with respect to times so retract that note that you skipped jesus last words would love to hear your account of that only dropped few contradictions from very long list if you would like me to ratlle off much more extensive list of biblical contradictions can the books really have serious problems between each other and evein in the same book in some cases it really does take leap of faith to think that they don

gt matt and jacob begat joseph the husband of mary of whom was born jesus who is called christ gt luke jesus was supposed to be the son of joseph who was the son of heli who was the son of matthat who was the son of levi who was the son of melchi gt where does mary come into that this is difference between their culture and our culture as you ll notice according to matthew account joseph is listed as the son of jacob in luke its heli the genealogies throughout are also different in other respects and again this was due to jewish culture luke speaks of joseph because lineage was never broken down via women in jewish days however luke genealogy is mary as due to the difference in the genealogies themselves and luke focus on mary herself you have to remember according to the biblical account jesus was not actually the son of joseph thus while he had legal right to the jewish kingship he had no physical right however mary lineage does give him that physical relation this is likely why the gospel writers felt it was important to record this don particularly want to go over all of the contradictions in the bible because ve never ever been given one that didn result due to person not looking at the passages in context or not understanding jewish tradition that one of the problems have with the arguements people like ehmert bring up their objections generally are very surface level and don even exist if you actually look at the passages in context

you have to go outside the text to account for the contradiction the text itself doesn give the account that you do but refers to joseph in both when you selectively add or subtract from text you are not doing critical reading but interpretation while some degree of interpretation might be inevitable especially with deficient text it is something try to avoid since to the degree that you interpret you are not reading the text itself but are reading into the text this statement of yours that you don want to go over the contradictions because they aren there seems unfair to me have problem see contradiction you have solution it isn really there by some application of context or tradition but you won share why not please note that have read the nt and have read passages in context that still appear to be contradications am very interested the greco roman world in the st as well as the in jewish traditions of that time period and have read fair amount on them learned ancient greek and latin and even know little hebrew even given the jewish tradition and given the context can reconcile luke with john cited above don you think you could help me out and show how context or tradition can resolve two separate and apparently different final quotes you say you have the solution so why not just clear it up for me
not to mention the question how is this going to make money
well that would stop the bookmarklets working all together the point in them is so that you can vote for things while not on the reddit site the demonstration script just mimics what would happen if user did click one of the bookmarklets
here the thing about the new site being too corporate or whatever python is not band with myspace profile and an awesome debut album it programming language programming languages live if they re used and more or less die if they re not used enthusiasts reddit users will find what cool regardless corporations on the other hand need to be marketed to if you love python you should love the idea of it putting on little bit of professional dress because that ultimately means you are more likely to actually get paid to program in python maybe one of the reasons you like python is because it kind of like the rebel base on jungle moon yavin staging daring attack on the big bad static empire there certainly part of me that feels that way as python becomes more mainstream you are going to feel some pain that doesn mean that the growth is wrong it means that you are devoted to being alternative not necessarily bad thing did you get into python because of how the old website looked of course not you didn really care because you re programmer the language was cool and that drew you in maybe the friendly community helped if this matches your experience and you didn really care about how the old site looked then recommend not caring about how the new site looks either end rant
one thing didnt like was the non reference to the green python logo the single most identifiable symbol it is also harder to read compare the download page http www python org doc to an old doc page http docs python org download html yet to be changed the design company has done seriously bad redesign because it fails in recognising the type heirarchy ie headings body type contrast amp white space can find the large type option but the contrast is screwed and the index page will not validate http validator org check uri http fwww python org what mess
did you get into python because of how the old website looked of course not you didn really care if it makes things hard to find becuase of poor layout amp readability it does the page has been re skinned vote the snake sheds its skin again
thinking scientists from nasa well nasa contractors anyway if not nasa though nasa does use at least one scripting language http rubygarden org ruby
quick fix off the top of my head have the http reddit com like page currently the attack vector check that the http_referer be http reddit com like bookmarklet an intermediate page on which the user must confirm the bookmarklets would then load the like bookmarklet url backward compatibility note requests for like can trampoline to like bookmarklet if http_referer isn present two clicks where previously there was only one but it stateless fix that doesn require rolling out new set of bookmarklets
but the index to select the docs is stuffed also hate how the logo was farmed out without any competitions sure better logo could have been sourced
well guess know why this page is rated on reddit
this blog is incredible don vote down just because it doesn have pictures or gadgets if ever there was site that deserves to be on the reddit front page for long time it this one
the fix mentioned at the bottom of the article and the reply by bjrn here would be better fixes they would requeir people to change their bookmarklets but it would stop script being run to increase sites points you shouldnt use referer as means of telling where people have come form they are often wrong referer spam and many people dont show them because they are blocked with firewall software
ah sorry didn follow that crucial little link at the top of the story and don use reddit all that much so wasn even aware of the bookmarklets well ok so it looks like this would be very difficult to fix if it true that you can just paste this script code anywhere and have it work the same as if it is in bookmarklet guess the alternative is to simply disallow votes from off site since as this article demonstrates it simply impossible to trust such things seems like good example of cool things you can do with the web vs security of course not bookmarklet expert perhaps there are things you can put in bookmarklet that won work in the body of document though as understand it the whole point of these things is that they are cross platform javascript so this would seem to make it hard to make distinction
here one multiple interpreters handled from within tcl itself granted for many people that may not be useful most of the time but when you need it it handy tcl threading and are also very nicely done tcl also comes with something event select based programming akin to twisted built in and written in such way that it easy to use in any case the point isn that python isn very fine language it is just that tcl isn some antiquated system that ready for the junk heap edited here another big one that forgot safe interpreters are going strong in tcl whereas in python if recall correctly safe execution was at one point given up as more or less hopeless
gt there plenty of muslim jewish etc fundamenalists whom love to see whisked away from this earth taking their intolerance hatred and fear with them what about atheists you don think there are plenty of them with intolerance hatred and fear gt hey sure jesus was great guy but don particularly need him as the middle man in my personal relationship with god you do and that fine by me the christian belief generally is that jesus is god not middle man gt now on the topic of ivory towers as you re looking down from the one you just built in your last post you might want to meditate bit on your stance that us lost non christian souls would be suprised if christianity wasn here to prop us up my what mighty tall and gleaming white tower you have there jp you are correct they would be suprised wasn the one making the claims that the planet would be better without christianity you were merely saying that if all the christians were to someday disappear just like if all atheists were to someday disappear there would be major problems both groups have redeeming qualities wasn the one taking the extremist stance you were
improved user interface with fancier icons great program
it apears my explination in the article of how to stop this wasnt clear enough have added an example of what the new url would look like it is simple fix but would stop the problem
have to disagree with their proposed solution not interested in linking to the site for no reason connected to my content
fair enough the old bookmarklet url would need to redirect then to page explaining that your bookmarklet needs to be upgraded please use this one from now on salted with the username as suggested note that an attacker might try to crawl reddit for usernames and attempt to upmod with each one in some background window settimeout thread in other words use the reader machine to search username space poor man xss attack to defeat this reddit would need to also add some kind of nonce to the bookmarklet url to be verified at upmod time the nonce would act like bookmarklet password you still need valid login cookie to use it so learning the nonce isn enough to gain full access to reddit under another username just to upmod links
speaking as fan and admirer of doug thomson call this ll sh admittedly this is weird post
it more fun doing it on paper
ahh but that would not work as the current system means you do actually need to be logged in with your account before you can use the bookmarklets in the first place which is why having your username or string connected to your username in the url is good idea not only do you need to know the extra string for the bookmarklet but you also have to be logged in with your account on reddit
gt ahh but that would not work as the current system means you do actually need to be logged in with your account before you can use the bookmarklets in the first place well since you re logged in as yourself all the other usernames would fail since you don have login cookies for those users but yours would succeed gt which is why having your username or string connected to your username in the url is good idea good point the nonce obviates the username assuming nonces are unique and map with usernames it becomes capability key for up down mod links on behalf of user foo
tcl was adopted by oracle corporation and is used for several of the enterprise manager oem event and job scripts see http www orafaq com faqtcl htm
yes that looks like solution but here an idea is it possible for malicious javascript to read user bookmarklets and find out what the user login is from the reddit url then the hacking script could simply use this itself know all browsers are different but seem to remember that at least in mozilla and firefox everything in the ui is dynamic xul so wouldn be surprised if scripts could find way to read such information even if they are not supposed to

big tcl fan but mostly the python guys are friendly and helpful guess the comment above is an exception remember meeting guido at the linux world conference in before python got as popular as it is today very nice down to earth guy who was pleasant to talk with mostly ve found their community to be pretty good although since haven been involved with python for while perhaps it changed recently and not aware of it

you betcha even the atheists good point my etc wasn satisfactory and generally there is no real concensus or writings in the scriptures that jesus is god it notion held by some not by others don assume that the heathen you re having this discussion with was always heathen know church or two full of good christians who don necessarily see jesus as god but the son of god merely divine mediator of the logos dare say christ himself might be awful suprised and possibly horrified to see himself crucified and hung on walls around necks and in churches the world over if my comments are construed by you as extremist well just don know what to say about that is this entire topic extremist the rapture is not an extremist view from christians point of view does my voicing an opinion on it make it so
not being corporate is not weakness of os but its strength don see why you should pretend to be corporate when you simply aren the most successful os projects succeeded without doing so many people still seem to have problems with the fact that os projects behave differently from firms and products and that they follow different laws don reduce os to novel apporach to project management alternatively insert some other concept of the corporate world if you do so you are missing the best of it

technically the private for profit corporation earned the money not the non profit the non profit is the single shareholder in the for profit corporation admittedly it was probably set up this way specifically so the non profit could have more control of their finances by not actually holding the money bag so to speak but the private for profit corporation has every right to keep it financials secret what don understand is why people care they are providing you with product that you use and like and they provide it free of charge to you so what if they make some money doing it at least that way they can keep making browser that like

thank you for posting this one robbie had come to the conclusion of math everyday for myself recently nice to get sychronistic confirmation
interesting but given that logged in reddit user has to be visiting that page already can see how this would skew the results significantly additionally you could even argue that there is some chance of them modding the page up in any case if they were interested enough to be there which would further reduce any distortion the only types of site where it might work would be thereg bbc cnn etc and can see them using this kind of hack

don want to say python isn powerful but think it is possible to distinguish between two major designs in programming languages few ideas used to create all the rest lisp forth smalltalk tcl joy tool based where there are number of built in stuff that the programmer can use to create programs in flexible and fast way python is imho designed using the second design allows you to solve simple problems in faster way there is already the tool for lot of common cases hashes slices generators lists comprehension and so on but this languages are limited because it very clear what the programmer did to extend the language and what was built in also this languages tend to have complex syntax that is not suitable for macro system many programmers will still love this languages python is cool to solve lot of real world problems reddit is written in python and it cool application for instance btw there are programmers that can only live with design to feel really free to program one of them and this is why can consider python as candidate for my programming tasks

this does not explain very well why tcl is now not popular and java is not sure that greenspun arguments are right tend to think that when the it industry started to grow programmers started to be not always hackers every year the hacker average programmer factor was smaller and powerful languages are often not good for average programmers in the last years after opensource internet and all the rest think the hacker average programmer factor is starting to grow again inverting the tendence wonder if this will change the programming languages world

furthermore if click on story from the main hot page then go read the comments if click hot thinking going to get back to where was all of the sudden just reading features reddit com or programming reddit com this is not intuitive and can be frustrating think in general the layout needs to suggest that you are not on the main page anymore maybe color difference in the navigation bar maybe each subreddit can have more distinct logo where the logo takes you to the subreddit but some other link takes you back to the main page agree with ahi the ui is not intuitive with this subreddit stuff
what everyone seems to be missing is that you can game the reddit page this way too just grep the page and find the javascript snippet next to arrow up and above the story you want to mod up you are kidding yourself if you think there is any way to stop bots from mimicking simple patterns in theory you need turing test captcha fortunately reddit even del icio us for that matter is still not that widely known and the people who use this have no real monetary incentives driving such behavior
find this article to be interesting for what it doesn say more than what it does the basic tenet of usability cannot argue with indeed try to uphold it wherever can in my work so think going to tell story drive toyota my first toyota was rav and coming from ford there was lot of new habits had to learn ie where the cruise control how do use it where the on button for the radio the heat and for the first couple of weeks get frustrated about the little things that kept getting tripped up by need to signal not activate the wiper blades but did learn it and came to deeply appreciate it so much so that when tried to drive ford again was extremely frustrated with the controls there even though had alreadly learned the ford way of doing things the toyota way was better for me glad took the time to learn it when someone tries to apply their habits to new environment whether it be an os or program they will inevitably become frustrated particularly if that program helps them do kind of work that they ve never done before does that automatically mean bad design on the part of the environment dear god hope not mean might it just be possible that the designers of that environment might have found better way to get the task done right the ui might have been unexpected at first but if with some familiarity the person using that ui discovers that hey got my work done in half the time with this method that was pretty sharp work on the designer part so maybe joel picked bad example rather have seen something cornier like hypothetical mp player prominently displaying the present bit rate of the song being played instead of the song title

there subtle but important difference between groups that have wisdom and those that don have those that don have are influenced by information cascades where people just imitate each other perfect example would be hit charts if instead the opinion of each individual is independent the group collective wisdom might even be greater than any of its individuals and even more importantly group performance is consistent given individual might outperform the group in one decision but completely fail at the next one with proper aggregation of the individuals information every extra bit of information that any individual has is added to the collective wisdom it requires special conditions though see james surowiecki the wisdom of crowds for more details it counter intuitive and surprising result but surowiecki gives convincing case for it he also outlines the other necessary conditions other than the independence of opinions of the individuals for groups to be wise in short they are the aggregation mechanism the diversity of information opinions

it is faster it is easier it has real object orientation by means of extensions itcl xotcl not this self juggling like python it is extensible it is reliable and consistent it has cool deployment facilities tclkit freewrap which python does not have
there is dict extension for for ages now reality it is dict from extracted and made as extension regarding the array removing do you like to have removed functionality from the core language that you have used in several lines of code before you really want to fix the breakage that comes out of such an action when you want need to switch versions
can consider python because there is already java
not even for loop
it is discussed http www tcl tk cgi bin tct tip and hope strongly that it will be in especially since the proposed object system sounds really good and useful don know of another language having such powerful and flexible object system
agree with many of this points but there are few not true it is faster untrue tcl is slower than python in many algorithmic tasks it has real object orientation feature that only ruby smalltalk self and few other can claim for all the rest mostly agree
wanting and manipulating are two different things all products eventually become commodities unless you choose niche market or drown your customer in ads and google in not in niche in general trust google for now they re the best but that much power will have the tendency to either corrupt the mere mortals there now or most definitely draw in true sociopaths even an honest mistake at such high level could wreck havoc guess we ll see soon enough note so far nobody is denying the comments that weird now my pc freezes when try to access google http www google com

well done guys nice idea and well implemented
nice turnaround unfortunately it looks like the voting toolbar got broken in the process error missing after argument list source code javascript mod db cuh this is in firefox btw
well let put it this way tcl feels faster than python from user point of view always see it when compare big ui applications written in either of the two languages for algorithms neither python nor tcl were made for heavy number crunching that is where the clean interface of tcl comes in handy

people shouldn worry about coding style this much code is readable with most styles used
this is followed by news in the uk that they are putting forward law where you have to get undeniable consent from the female to have sex if she is very drunk and agrees to sex then it could later be claimed to be rape what do you have to do in this society to feel safe that the female you have sexual intercourse with is not going to cry rape is it going to be case of getting written consent for sex talk about girl power they re getting power hungry
not all men are rapists
gt on the other end of the equation is real person that wasted their time and effort creating submission for jobs that often don even exist that true but on the other hand there are people who mindlessly apply for everything even jobs listed in different continent with requirements they simply don have job offer with must speak english german and italian and live in spain will regularly draw applications from people with zero second languages who live in new york for example
sorry did miss the punchline
professors aren always hired for their teaching expertise and even if they are good teachers they may only be good at teaching some specialty subject and not freshman english the problem is that nobody wants to teach freshman english but it has to be done in order to ensure that the incoming freshmen are aware of the standards for good writing this system sounds good to me students write more and get more feedback from more eyeballs looking at their work they re not getting reamed by some hardass professor nor are they getting it too soft to learn what they need to learn everyone idea of what good writing is is different averaging the varying opinions means you arrive at some sort of objective standard there are probably some kinks to be worked out of the system but it still an improvement
what was the defense attorney doing sleeping
according to wikipedia the spanish inquisition executed around people for being heretical this is not including around people who died in prison this is also starting from base afaik of requiring that every citizen be catholic to start with the non catholics were deported beforehand now if american fundamentalist christians are in an unprecendented position of power then how come atheists agnostics polytheists and so on aren being executed as we speak explicitly due to their religion where are these trials taking place how come the approximately of non protestants in america aren being deported there are always people about whom you can say can you imagine what would happen if they actually got their way the point is that with the current society these people don get their way sure they get their tv programs they get their radio shows they get elected into office and so on but they find that they can actually get done more than of what they actually want to do even gwb the most powerful of them all is finding there is limit to what people will let him get away with agree that it is best not to mix religion and politics agree that the uprising of fundamentalist christianity is worrying very strongly agree that you have to constantly fight against it to stop bad things happening in the future but saying that fundamentalist christianity has more power now than ever before is just little off the wall
gt almost all of mark content is found in matthew and about two thirds of mark is found in luke gt gt matthew and luke share content not found in mark gt the above are quotes taken from the page linked they may be marvelously insightful rigorously factual or smashingly wrong it seems to me that they are not mathematically inconsistent lets say the total contents of all the gospels are the alphabets mark gospel has matthew has and luke has and the above statements seem to be valid for this case it seems to me that religious faith is faith you cannot argue with reason to show any faith is correct or incorrect ideally the fact that we can either prove disprove the consistency of gospels should not in anyway alter our faith

precisely it all about whether or not you ve seen the sequence before and recognize it trying to figure it out by math will just frustrate you for example the sequence is the sequence of perfect numbers using bit of math figured out it was doing this so figured that the next logical value for would be since it the next prime and that the sequence it took before that well it turns out that actually kind of derived bit of perfect number math but didn know what was looking for so got the answer wrong in spite of doing most of the mathematical heavy lifting simply because didn already know what the sequence was

the funny part for me was when he says gödel incompleteness theorem which staggered the mathematical world in by proving that no formal system is powerful enough to derive all of the true or false statements in that system he needs to read the book again as he obviously missed the entire point if he thinks the incompleteness theorem means what he just said grin find that lot of people have difficulty with the actual theory and end up with well intentioned mental garbage when trying to describe it one can hope that his second reading will give him more insight

if could choose just one kind of people to get rid of in this world am not advocating violence but one can wish they just disappear can one people advocating censorship of any kind would probably be on the top of the list regardless of the reason they have or pretend to have in some cases censorship simply never is acceptable the potential for abuse is lot lower if everyone who knows anything can publish it and all opinions are out there and available too would classify stuff like ndas as censorship too btw so we have lots of it in our society left to get rid of
good point but think we just move the game from lexical coding style arguments into semantic coding style arguments like the use of design patterns when to optimize whether to use functional style or not how much refactoring to do whether or not to unit test for what and how much big classes or small ones how much abstraction is good abstraction classes or closures etc etc etc etc the answer to these and many of the big religeous questions is is good_ use it to your best advantage

statically typed languages know the types of my objects and can therefore tell me the source code tells me too it right there to see wonderful self documenting feature run my code all the time typo in one particular file doesn necessarily get executed all that often and the error messages don always pinpoint the problem for you like said the problem doesn present itself as long as your codebase is relatively small and or you are so involved with it that you are essentially carrying map of around in your head which tends to be the case when you are building your sparkling new app but later on say oh years from now that map in your head will be out of date and of little help to you

totally agree with jesusphreak there is nothing wrong with preaching and evangelism it is great way to spread message commend the people who go out of their way to spread an idea they honestly and truly believe is good for themselves and you applaud there action people may not like it but have always found them very curteous and some of them very enjoyable heck also like penn amp teller for their tv show they also are evangalizing and thank god for that
here real world example that may be bit better have vw jetta that absolutely love but there is big useability issue the seats have three controls on them black tab in the front which makes the seat slide forward and back thats totally normal almost all cars have that the others though are bit confusing the first is handle on the side of the seat ahh that must make the seat tilt forwards and backwards like in almost all cars right wrong instead pushing down on it causes the seat to lower and pulling up raises the seat so how do you tilt the seat there is knob that you must turn that causes the seat to tilt furthermore you practically need to be double jointed in order to operate it if vw had followed the tenant then the operation of those two controls would have been reversed though the method of operation of the two controls closely match the actual action that the seat performs pumping up and down causes vertical motion and twisting forward and back titls still have to explain to most passengers how to operate their seat since they expect the controls to operate like all the other seat controls that they have encountered

as larry wall has pointed out the usefulness of language is inversely proportional to the number of philosophical axes it has to grind part of the reason for perl popularity is the fact that you can write perl in fortran or lisp style there is an idiomatic style which most perl shops enforce culturally but when you want or need to you can break from it part of the reason why python popularity is growing slower than it has been is the fact that there is only one style allowed python style that and some of us are afraid to use language where the creator has talked about removing map filter reduce and lambda just to force people to program in more pythonic style what other restrictions might be added later that could force me to go reformat and or rewrite thousands of lines of already working code

have couple of beefs with the simple minded analysis that consumer reports has done first many of the hybrid models have better performance than the conventional models so you re paying more for vehicle with better acceleration second consumer reports doesn distinguish between the money you re spending to pump oil out of the ground transport it and refine and money you re spending to that goes toward covering past present and future amp on automobile technology if had to choose between giving oil companies and giving say toyota might choose to give toyota all that said don own hybrid and have no plans to buy one rather buy smaller lighter sportier car that gets good mileage but don think that people who buy hybrids are morons

gt its also not something that controls me of course it never has if your still virgin gt might even be in better state than most guys because what look for in wife which will be the first woman have sex with is good relationship the physical comes later that way not marrying woman that isn right for me anyway just saying that thinking that the physical part of mariage is no matter will likely come back to haunt you not shaking out all the difficulties of an adult relationship now will only put off those problems until you get into mariage were your the only way out carries much larger penalty as far as being in better state than most guys doubt that any man would be willing to go marry just any girl he willing to sleep with gt gt women are not goddesses sex is not worth making life decisions around gt of course they aren that why not making my life decisions around them meant getting married in order to satisfy temporary desire to have sex with someone this should not even be factor in the decision

one would think that if racism was factor in the jury decision the jury themselves would not have acquitted him of supposedly raping the year old state unequivocally that the charge was ridiculous and convict him of having oral sex with the year old only with the caveat that although that is the law and he clearly did break it they think the law is fucked up and he shouldn have been prosecuted

nice site hitting next generates another random picture tons of pictures nice
the point of the play which havn read but get the idea from the article is that it not religion that bad it those that warp it for their own evil purposes that are so if you understand the message of the play it shouldn be offensive to any religion because if you are not warping the religion to your own personal benifit it not talking about you but extremists are the ones warping their religion and advocating violence and censorship these are the people getting offended further proving the point of the play
very poor article
gt of course it never has if your still virgin hey know plenty of guys that are not virgins but have since decided to be abstinent its only something that controls you if you let it gt just saying that thinking that the physical part of mairage is no matter will likely come back to haunt you not shaking out all the difficulties of an adult relationship now will only put off those problems until you get into mariage were your the only way out carries much larger penalty why is sex difficulty that needs to be shaked out if ve never had sex with anyone before my wife how will know if its good sex or bad sex it won matter to me as ll still enjoy it won have any other experiences to compare it to won be jaded about it and as result the other essentials over our relationship with be stronger gt meant getting married in order to satisfy temporary desire to have sex with someone this should not even be factor in the decision hey we agree on something

the power of limited free time to read randomly headlined articles
gt friends don let friends let christianity ruin sex for them try pre marital sex highly recommend it like said in another post how is sex ruined if the only person you ever have it with is your wife you won have any previous experiences to compare it to you ll just really enjoy it plus it means bit more because you and your wife were willing to have enough self control to only have sex with each other nobody else has experienced the other person physically like that how many of you guys like to get hand me downs do you prefer driving used car over new one anyone
think the free time issue is important if you are new to reddit you tend to read everything on the frontpage after sometime you tend to select more and read beyond the frontpage my
consider what you are saying someone is stupid for clicking on headlines that interest them and not clicking on headlines that seem uninteresting you want everyone to click every link to determine the links merit on its own value what do you need reddit for then you just click on every site on the internet and sure you will eventually find the good ones headlines matter lot they can make more people look at link creating bigger pool of people who might vote it up especially the way the new page works now site can get up down votes for good or irrelevant reasons but if those first few votes are negative the site is probably not going anywhere having good headline can make the difference in the first few votes and probably many votes afterwards

indead if creativity and solving tough problems sounds anything like your job and this should be especially true in startup imagine then you be served well to get some sleep and spend some time just casually thinking about your work while not working anyway realizing that their are limits on productivity allows one to prioritize and that means cutting off the features that are less important
does reddit count as err research for work
the article mentions something interesting that ve nver thought about that overtime is usually compensated for by undertime later however don think undertime happens so much at startups but it defineitely happens at big companies know this from personal experience when worked at startup we often worked hours day and on weekends but can really recall any time we slacked off to make up for it however at the big company work for now see it all the time the day after someone puts in or hours to finish project they spend the next day surfing the web checking personal email paying bills etc ps on my lunch break so this doesn count
gt don know how many of you have daughters but gaurantee you that most of you would not be okay with your year old having sex with guys the majority of parents don want their year old sons having sex with girls either admit it smaller majority than the above but not that much smaller is not much older than so don think it should be crime larger age difference and for example should be

all of this seems to predicate on the notion that teenagers shouldn be allowed to make their own decisions and hence make their own mistakes without there being someone to blame depending on the specific people involved wizened year old could be the one taking advantage of the innocent year old if year old can get driver permit and thus be able to kill family driving along in their mini van why can they choose or not choose to date whomever they want of course that is slippery slope the other way which ends with asking whether an year old should be allowed to go on dates with year olds but it is murky gray area in between where parents and their teens seem to want different laws even if you had one single black and white age of adult hood one age of consent for drinking for driving for the draft for voting etc let us assume even then what of the year old couples when one of them turns does she suddenly become paedophile so obviously that is silly as well so the next question is how big of an age range is too big why is year old marrying year old ok but it isn okay for year old to date year old was at one time myself year old single guy some decade ago and at one time before that was and at some time after that when was would have been pretty psyched if some year old girls wanted to hang out with me when was dated some and year old girls when was had already been married years but if not would it have been truly evil for me to date year old unsure but depending on the state would either be fine or an imprisoned sex offender there is also some notion in all this of children as their parents property suppose that currently this is roughly the case but it is quite strange notion as well guess will not be able to intelligently talk about this matter until my own children are teenagers

education isn right to begin with nobody should be prevented fom achieving an education if they desire to put in the work and sacrifice but it is not predestined right of any individual to be given education
perhaps the best lesson can pass along to my upper and middle class students is to merely point them in the direction of their foreign born classmates who can remind us all that education in america is still more privilege than right compulsory privilege
don think it ironic it just means he one of group of people that measures in the high digits have to agree somewhat although like reddit don see how it could make money and flagr it not at all clear what it even does unless you are tuned into all the buzz most people aren if my wife were to go to that site it would make zero sense to her whatsoever

relative level of intoxication is actually not that sound of defense it doesn matter who is more intoxicated it matters that one of those involved was intoxicated and regretted the decision in the morning to me everything you do when voluntarily intoxicated should be culpable since you chose to become intoxicated you should automatically assume the responsibility for that action but even this would be huge gray area of abuse because it is also not right to use someone as rag doll just because you managed to find them too drunk to argue

gt this led me to think that videotaping every time you have sex might be good idea reminds me of an article read that advocated that form of big brother might not be so bad if instead of the state recording everything everyone was recording everyone else then people would be recording the state the police the mob etc for example the crimes at abu gharib are quite shocking because of the photos the photos were difficult to deny and weasel around give every solidier every policeman every citizen camera

eh lucky for them its not an option for bush to be up for reelection they don have to maky any decisions about it if the republicans put out john mccain they won have much of problem winning the election especially if the dems are foolish enough to actually run hilary clinton mccain is very moderate so he capture votes from both sides while someone like clinton will chase away just about every conservative there is dunno the dems were foolish enough to run john kerry in virtually the only reason bush won that election is because kerry was so unlikeable and had so many issues flip flopping the dems just really gotta be smarter about who they run would be interesting if they tried someone like barak obama

have an old school alarm clock with these buttons forward fast amp slow and reverse fast amp slow best alarm clock ever because you can change the time to anything in less than seconds and ve gotten good enough to use the fast buttons to adjust my wake up time with one hand well half asleep the only problem is can find new one and ve had it for so long that the slow buttons have loosened and become fast buttons as well
wikipedia says that falling skydiver reaches about mph http en wikipedia org wiki so we have ft hr mi mi ft sec hr seconds there will be some additional time when the faller accelerates from standing to terminal velocity would it really take seconds

ruby on rails is already overtaking zope and zope has been around for quite some time while rails has only existed for little more than two and half years its only matter of time before rails becomes prevalent in web development at this rate the only thing stopping it is the fact that many hosts still don support it as soon as that happens it will become as popular as php imo
the sad thing is that similar findings have been made for people all over the world america is among the very worst but no one is actually good for example according to http www macalester edu weekly wnr html the participants were tested on questions on geographic knowledge and current events the results were then graded according to the grading system used in the the best scoring country sweden only got an average of questions right in other words grade sweden was followed by italy and germany with points each the scored grade with an average of correct answers they had cause to celebrate as mexico score now occupies the last place standing that the scored in the previous survey other countries tested were france japan britain and canada am not saying america is excused because the other countries don shine either am saying everyone needs to work on this especially america

if you give group of people such as the government power it is forgone conclusion they will abuse that power power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely if you don want abuses of power don turn power over to groups of people such as the government the more power the government has the greater the opportunity and likelihood for abuse and corruption this is why libertarians and traditional conservatives oppose big government it not because we are selfish unless you consider the desire to live in corruption free state to be selfish it because we recognize the net result of big government is evil very few alleged conservatives are real traditional conservatives of the barry goldwater brand

the problem with rules is that some people will apply the rule even when the rules do not apply this is recipe for avoiding thinking those who have worked for large company government contract and those cmm whaterver certified know what am talking about in real life think airport security now back to programming try to apply this rule in java method which opens file and connection to database just the exception handling there will take lines of code again rule is good but good judgement is the best solution
this is not recipe for avoiding thinking it forces you to think method that both opens connection to database and opens file is obviously very poorly abstracted refactoring it would lead to much cleaner code show me your code and ll show you the refactoring

like my alarm clock it is cheap electronic one with exactly buttons hour minute alarm and snooze if you press alarm you will see the alarm time then press hour and minute to set the alarm holding it makes hours just go minutes will go in steps of when holding if you want to disable the alarm just press the alarm button for seconds the only problem is can put it too close to my bed because disabled it few times in my sleep without even remembering later when it was close to my bed so guess the interface is pretty well designed if using it is possible without conscious thought

subjectivity subjectivity and thirdly subjectivity it comes down to who has the right to take away that right from people you thought abortion was tough arguement now you are trying to stop people from having baby forever it is an interesting thought though what if we consider this as power law problem that is there are only few people who are the absolute worst offenders and most other people poor or not are still contributing to society so you have general laws and measures to deal with most cases but you need something extreme to solve the last few cases that are doing the most damage while don think sterilization is the answer don know what is there are so many factors to this one of the biggest is that its hard to detect problems and enforce solutions you don hear about the problem until something goes terribly wrong once you do prison terms come to an end and taking children away doesn stop more from being made it tough question as this person found out question that just one person can answer on his own

if women have the choice to abort then the men have the choice to support financially that seems to make sense making it really two party decision which means the man needs to be informed of the pregnancy and must be able to make his choice in advance so there is time for an abortion if he decline financial responsibility if he isn informed of the pregnancy then would we argue he doesn have to support
this guy ruby is marginal at best the article is filled with typos and in several cases the explanations are more complicated than they need to be
have one thats like that and only aboud years old ll post the model number when get home if remember
why not just walk using real feet
why because someone compiled list of the worst geographic and cultural perpetrated by americans why exactly does not knowing much about the rest of the world make me dumb to me it seems about as likely as not knowing much about biochemistry or the european history in the or how sardine packaging plant works all this article says is that by the estimates of cultures that do value wider geographic knowledge cultures that do not value wider geographic knowledge are dumb well of course is it bad thing to not know what is going on in the world probably does that really make you dumb no ignorant yes but that is different matter am ignorant because really don care enough to learn about it which is entirely different from lack of mental ability that said there is difference between ignorance and asking stupid questions know what language they speak in england funny english and generally refrain from assuming that hollywood tells me anything accurate at all maybe that makes me above average as an american but if so dear god don tell me about it my ego is already big enough this is my opinion if you disagree that is great but an opinion cannot be wrong

gt and yet the same people who say that exponential resource usage growth is perfectly ok still condemn lisp for being too slow and then they want to to use visual blub net or ee both of which are slower than cmucl
paranoia paranoia everybody comming to get me
they ll continue to use old versions of windows really doubt vista will be usable on machines
which means forced conversion seems like really bad idea it can be abused totally agree it could be dangerous market driven one where the is market reward for being sterlized it would make more sense payment of money or drugs to the individual which means people will have free choice in getting the sterilization society would be better off since less impoverished children in the worst circumstances will be born read freakonomics really good analysis of this idea now on the question of changing one mind if it were possible to have reversable sterlization that would be great otherwise those who want children would need to wait for an adoption assuming they are fit or pay for surrogate mother if they can afford
or they did lot of interviews personally think they just made it easy by hiring actors

disagree number sequences do have lot to do with math much of math requires an intuitive sense of how to get get where yo re trying to get to beyond mere calulation take trig proofs as an example
it tough call but going to have to come down in favor of this one there have been number of incidents of delivery drivers and gas station clerks being forced to use guns in self defense then getting fired for it employers can guarantee their employees safety under those circumstances so the employees should be permitted to do it themselves
seriously this is the creepiest article have ever read from reddit link
what is wrong with keeping your task list in text file it keeps you from wasting time dorking around with font settings and alignment can be easily processed by almost every programming language known to man and makes copy paste operations lot more useful if you thought about it doubt you could seriously come up with lot of good reasons to not use text file
gt and then they want to to use visual blub net or ee both of which are slower than cmucl yeah but try doing crud operations on windows specific infrastructure in cmucl people make language choices for variety of reasons platform quality and language wahoozits usually get trumped by design requirements
huh make things kindof hard to see on the desktop
if enough people are willing to buy machines running vista someone will figure out way to make them how much did desktop systems cost few years ago remember it having four numbers before the decimal not three

he called the masses rushing to try rails mediocre not the all of the people using it beyond that he is right it is harder than php because it requires you learning more than just language really though months worth of yahoo search statistics only tells you that ror is in vogue not that it is doing better than zope it has lot more marketing behind it which means more people who have not heard about it are trying to learn something
yes we ve been acquired by google and we re really excited about this for many many reasons but can hear you saying don care why you re excited want to know how this change will impact me claudia

the rim ntp settlement removed the uncertainty surrounding the future of the crackberry but the settlement also sets nasty precedent and calls into question the viability of some of the patent laws this could have terrible effect on tech development in the us and open the door for other patent squatters
ah didn notice that no wonder they seemed so confident once they found their country ok back to believing it
the dumbness comes in because the people are extremely confident when asked which country should we invade but simple test shows that their confidence is ridiculous given their ignorance of the country in question
totally doubt vista with aero can run well on machines even one year from now with all you can get is intergrated audio video that seems pushing it if you want aero and how can cover vista software and pc no chance
say it is more an example of calling something as you see it spend some time interacting with python people and you will see that most of them are nice if anything the community has gotten more friendly over time the permafrost comment is right up there with bsod in windows and clumsy guis in linux possibly true at one time but no longer really the case
that would be pretty hard considering cmucl doesn run on windows know there are lot of criteria for selecting language my comment was only in response to the common claim about lisp being too slow
edward burtynsky has some remarkable images of shipbreaking as well http www cowlesgallery com burtynsky shipbreaking html
can you explain they are contrived sure but that not the same thing
no in this case stands for ruby not just
this really does not say all that much yes it is big impressive number but what kind of hardware was involved how does the workload distrobution compare to other platforms if ror can handle million requests in day but takes three times as many servers along with applicable license and hardware support costs how much of win is it really
they aren theya re worried about uby
yes did try ror and read both books axe and ror books in php you can create dynamic db web face in matter of minutes without even learning anything at all in ror you have to learn alot in order to bind db to web page in fact you have to read few chapters minimium before you are able to put simple db grid with db search so excuse me realist do not believe that masses of mediocre programmers will jump on ror bandwagon abandoning easiest tools they have ever had asp and php don loose your sleep over it

gt python style that and some of us are afraid to use language where the creator has talked about removing map filter reduce and lambda just to force people to program in more pythonic style he is talking about removing them because python supports what they do in different way and is much faster at it that way it is not about forcing people into anything it is about removing something that is really not needed gt what other restrictions might be added later that could force me to go reformat and or rewrite thousands of lines of already working code perl has never done this breaking changes are largely kept to major revisions in which case you should not upgrade for already written code
wrt paid sterilization assume you re crackhead assume you have fertile son daughter partner mother who you can intimidate into getting sterilized so you get the anything occur to you
just heads up these laws require your employer to allow you to leave your firearm in your car you can bring it from your car onto their property without their permission it the same way in many states you may now carry weapon in your car on school property while dropping or picking children up but you can take it out of your car
can see your point rss would remove lot of the value in slashdot or reddit for example but it is good for lot of other sites
the argument that the author presents isn any more cogent or valuable than when it was new which was long long time ago any given number puzzle could turn out to be trick question the next number in the sequence could turn out to be amp pi instead of so what any question could turn out to be trick the fact remains that most people can recognize that is better answer than amp pi here because it is better answer than amp pi could make big argument about kolmogorov complexity or such but that would distract form the real point which is that you have to be very clever in very stupid way to swallow this clever but stupid writer clever but stupid argument
great post disclaimer suck at those number sequences problems too but have always explained the arbitrariness of those puzzles to others as my reasons for not liking them so at least feel all warm and validated now we have one such puzzle on our candidate tech quiz at work of course didn get it when took the quiz but for the benefit of future candidates have protested the question of course also think there natural tendency to blast things we aren good at it doesn mean you shouldn do it you should just be extra careful in your reasoning
it an interesting issue right now the situation is somewhat unfair for men but if men had the choice to negate financial support the unfairness would be tipped the other way women would still face difficult series of physical obligations neither pregnancy nor abortion is lot of fun while men would merely have to sign on the dotted line and be free of responsibility
completely against gun control but this is case of property rights it should be between the employer and employee and in the contract whether the employee can bring gun to work and the government should not be involved it tempting though to support this just to counter gun grabbing legislation must resist using government force seriously it easy to see how government grows so quickly when groups and are all trying to use government against each other
so true gave up on virgins dunno what all those extremists see in them reminds me of robin williams joke on the matter from his live on broadway show he mentioned the virgins and then said now anyone who been with virgin before is already thinking hmm dunno

yes believe there are always risk involved with any government system which voluntarily gives out money people will abuse the system there is no doubt of that that alone isn reason to ban it on potential of abuse if it were than any form of social assistance that can potentially lead to abuse would be cancelled think the end goal is most cases wouldn be abuse that some fringe cases might

this is amazing now want to buy bike just so can follow this tutorial
guess you are saying the same thing as hxa but honestly don see it these number puzzles are different they don give you all the information you need to solve the problem down to one solution take some coin weighing problem given this info about your setup determine which is the heavier coin okay sure you could say well there are an infinite number of solutions because the puzzle teller could be lying about the setup that bogus because in math you are constantly taking givens as your assumptions which you use to get an answer or you might argue that you could hold the coins in slightly different ways when you weighed and thus get an infinite number of solutions that totally fine in this case your solution would fall in the equivalence class of valid solutions but the problem with number sequence problems is that you have no way of testing your answer in my previous example there was set of answers in number sequence problem you can test if your solution is right or if you say sure you can the test is to see if your formula matches then here is my answer for number sequence problems that will ever be given if the sequence is then my answer for the formula is
don think people are disagreeing that number sequences have to do with math the blog author point is that number sequence problems don have an answer like you say take trig proofs as an example you are trying to get to the ordered set of steps that proves the theorem statement
thank god it is now official was getting sick of all the rumor posts here
today there have been three different polls from zogby gallup and harris respectively about americans views on intelligent design and creationism they all seem to agree on one thing there is fair amount of ranting in the piece thats old but wasn aware of the poll results at least
did too found myself hoping that the daily show picks up the story just to make that joke
does the article actually specify the race of any of the clients or even the social worker the most see is spare selection of words baby mama that might suggest certain cultural memberships this is interesting in as much as the reader brings his her own stereotypes to bear on this and fills in the imagery
my wife works as state prosecutor the people she deals with the hours she works the meager state salary she is paid thank goodness still have my software job is all can say for now were in her shoes would have quit dozen times maybe the time when the juvenile murder defendant and his father threatened her and followed it up by jumping rail in the courtroom maybe the time when the crazed hillbilly wrote her page letter detailing his guns and the people including her he was going to kill with them dunno perhaps having to go in on monday morning and evaluate the depravity level of few gigs of child porn so the correct charges could be filed but one of those times would have said enough and gone to work at barnes and noble law loans or no law loans can tell you the people who can work in these environments with these hours for this pay hats off to you and good luck

the argument against this is that the employer not allowing them to bring the weapon onto their property pretty reasonable request effectively prevents the employee from carrying his weapon where it is legal such as on the drive to work letting the employee leave it in his car which is the employee property seems like reasonable compromise to me
think it be interesting if one of the more stigmatized religions like the wiccan faith or even scientologists faced obstacles to community involvement cuz essentially they are faith based and they could have community initiative if they faced barriers then if reading the executive order correctly dhs would have to step in to eliminate any obstacles to their participation but considering the stigma surrounding those faiths any guess if there be resistance or public backlash then dhs would have to either violate their order or cheese off conservative public interesting scenario no

this is just more fud the windows kernel makes every effort to fill every bit of memory available to it when idling windows tries to fill ram with apps you are likely to run and if you do they come up faster if you don run an expected app then it just uses the prefilled ram for that so uncommon apps don load any slower than they would otherwise the idea is that if you have memory that isn being used for something it is being wasted

my guess is that most of the people who are disagreeing with the lines rule haven read martin fowler he makes great case for putting readability first and one of the best ways to do that is to extract methods when things get unclear it better than commenting of course this only applies to object oriented code procedural and functional code would need different guidelines

first off why would you consider it right wing because you don believe there is any possibility that there is such human depravity secondly why would you question that all these incidents could happen to one social worker what cave have you been living in there are lot of messed up people out there crack and meth have made the situation even worse
and it would help to clean out the gene pool

should have noted that while there is big difference in how vocal and upfront people are about racism the endogenous levels are very similar particularly as it relates to court cases the driving while black offense happens everywhere especially in california where live now and in st louis where used to live and racism is fucking rampant in cincinnati was truly offended whenever visited there however never having lived in the south can only take the word of minorities who have lived there and the consensus with the caveat that it just my personal experience is that though people in the south are more vocal at least you know what you re dealing with right away
but was under the impression that the department of homeland security was for protecting america from terrorism no you see the point of the department is to provide political cover for bumbling administration who placates thier constituency with programs designed to erode the church state wall so with that in mind you can see quite clearly how the program fits into the department
if you re from an area of the country that hasn yet been hit hard by the meth epidemic then you might find it easy to dismiss these stories out of hand however much of the west coast of the us has been dealing with this stuff for almost years now and it doesn matter if you re in small white town in eastern oregon or an ethnically diverse city like la meth is causing lot of these problems it also very easy to conclude that this is not problem that we educated smart people would ever have however there is much evidence that shows that using meth only once can lead to severe addiction people who we once would have considered intelligent capable sane human beings can find themselves addicted to this stuff and it totally ruins their judgement and steals their sanity used to be all for drug legalization but now with meth on the scene not so sure it good idea then again neither is the current drug war which isn working at all not that all of the anecdotes from the social worker were about meth addicted people but it certainly sounded like at least half of them were

don really see how this has anything to do with abortion women are able to forego supporting their children by putting them up for adoption maybe comparison could be made there but don know anything about alimony amp child support law the analogy to abortion just doesn fit gt feit counters that the suit reference to abortion rights is apt gt gt roe says woman can choose to have intimacy and still have control over subsequent consequences he said no one has ever asked federal court if that means men should have some similar say but the court hasn said that women have control over the subsequent consequences of intimacy the court has said that their right to privacy means that they can do what they please with their bodies men also have that right they thus have equal protection under the law pregnancy if man got pregnant he could also have an abortion this amounts to lawsuit against the federal government because men cannot get pregnant men rights ftw edit and the description of the plaintiff situation doesn really make sense to me either it sounds unfair but only because it sounds like his partner lied to him in order to become pregnant if that is the case then it seems like her actions should constitute fraud if that is not the case then it doesn sound particularly unfair to me at all it equally unfair to both of them if he wants to have say in whether the kid gets put up for adoption then he should attempt to become its legal guardian

well first of all just because they are implying that they found some dumb american doesn mean they are saying you are dumb interview enough people and you ll find some funny cases however on more serious note let us imagine that these people are representative in representative democracy the will of the people is manifest in the government which acts on that will since the seems to feel that it can act without the cooperation of the united nations which not arguing for or against it is simply fact then the could in principle make decisions about what to do with very large army based on this kind of stupidity of course there is no way this would happen there are hell of lot of very dedicated and educated people in for example the cia the cia world factbook online is pretty much the classic geographic state of the world reference use it in teaching all of the time on the other hand in california things can be done directly by the people by referendum in that case suppose the army of california could decide to attack australia thinking it was iran go arnie go say all of this as someone who has sister who once couldn answer the question what continent is south africa on lt

there is another thing to be asked about id the behaviour of the opponents and no am not creationist or an id proponent there are total idiots arrogant lunatic etc pp imagine that the author of the article tries to said that to creationist biker my conclusion will be that he will end in trashcan before the end of his rant heck even before he can start his rant the problem with many sceptics and some scientists and engineers is their total lack of social awareness and that they don see their opponents as equals the first defense is no certainly we value creationists as persons in that case you are lying or suffer under self deception really the second defense is it does not matter if am rude it much more important that am telling the truth wrong noone will hinder you to speak but noone is compelled to listen if people deny to listen to you because you are rude the truth can reach them so if someone cannot argue creationism and evolution without holding his tongue and stop being derisive please don argue at all other evolutionists who are more social will thank you

since aero depends heavily on the graphics card how will this affect battery power on laptops since the gpu is going to be doing number crunching during normal windows use plus companies with many windows computers that are trying to save power wont be so happy after they install vista and the graphics card is rendering graphics all the time and not only while employees are playing games not to mention the cost of buying new hardware in the first place

gt and the description of the plaintiff situation doesn really make sense to me either it sounds unfair but only because it sounds like his partner lied to him in order to become pregnant if that is the case then it seems like her actions should constitute fraud it difficult to consider in court the possibility that the woman is lying if the courts agree that the man isn responsible for child support because he was deceived then men everywhere can make similar claims to get off the hook whether their girlfriends lied or not after all how could you ever really determine who lying edit in criminal cases there is presumption of innocence defendent doesn need to prove that he innocent the burden of proof is on the prosecution but what do you do in situation like this who is presumed to be innocent or in this case honest

awesome let stereotype now that right elderly poorly educated southerners were the only ones that voted for bush somehow these people also mananged to sneak into northern states and voted for bush there also magic bullet no magic ballot doesn sound so far off though
this is personal blog where one person expresses his own personally opinions how is it wrong to express your frustrations in this format it not and your analogy creationist biker is lame and irrelavant don know what crowds you move with if you re concerned with being dunked in trashcans by angry bikers to proport social advice to others
somebody forgot to tell them that pastel colors rounded corners and tabs are only for web startups
really don like the way things are going with google now you re searching the web sending email writing documents blogging and saving files online using google services does anybody else see the problem here
hey my parents voted for bush not saying only stereotype votes for bush or believes foolish things saying that his blog is perfectly appropriate venue to rant on issues that frustrate him considerations of of the american population aside

the other link above suggests it actually almost this bad eleven percent of americans not being able to pinpoint america on map you can think that stuff up sure they picked out bad but they probably had only rare good answers anyway
um you can kick your neighbor out of your house for any reason gun in his pocket or no employers have completely different relationship with their employees there are many reasonable exceptions that can be made to private property rights private property is not holy above all other things forever and ever amen
well that more like arrogance in part held up by dumbness it the relative or in these cases near complete lack of thinking about it instead opting for an opinion of alright terrorism not dead yet let pick another country and see if attacking that helps that disturbs me
gt after all how could you ever really determine who lying the same way any other case of civil fraud would be determined
if you want to take your gun to work and your employer doesn allow it then you need to find new job no one is forcing you to work there
going to have to completely agree with the pub owner here he has every right to ask people to remove their hats and applaud him for applying the policy uniformly even to the elderly

no you are an idiot thanks for confirmation of my post can consider the value of message thanks but my post have you and probably others so incensed that you are switching to derogatory language why are you angry explain that perhaps because your attempts to discuss with people with differing worldviews were utterly fruitless you know that you are right your arguments were correct but they didn accept it hell they must be idiots there is no other explanation and now here is someone who is blaming me better not listening your whole behaviour reflects that you are frustated and angered by what you see as demise of western civilazation read voltaire or any other book of someone who was in far more serious situation and look how they handled it if you can believe me they used humor and sticked to the truth but they regarded their enemies not with contempt if they didn do crimes ever wondered why creationism linked darwinism with anti social behaviour think about that because you know its the message not the messenger
that is truly worth treasure hunt how bizarre
analogue or classic clock faces certainly look more aesthetically pleasing
sterilization is either permanent or has unknown long term health effects for the chemical kind if people are already so addicted or insane that you want to sterilize them how can they give consent um if they re not competent to accede to sterilization then they are ok to raise children
too bad handwriting is obsolete these days
quote ever wondered why creationist linked darwinism with anti social behavior think about that because you know its the message not the messenger quote because creationism is believed because it part of very important social construct the church but belief in rationality has no necessary constraint to be founded in social construct it is easy to argue irrationally but compellingly that believing in non socially necessary idea will make you anti social likewise it would be also argued that not believing in something socially necessary like religion will ostracize you from the community that values the beliefs of the church most people are unwilling to ostracize their friends for the questionable personal benefits of purporting reason aka does this make me look fat maybe it does
iduno of the comments here certainly are and that ok hide of the articles without reading them amp that ok too
the games are by far the best part
did not so assume many others didn
gt you could counter with the assumption that someone in that line who overheard mr buns actually liked the steadfastness and strict adherence to the rules of the manager and started recommending the store to others worst counterpoint ever can guarantee that this scenario has never happened in history nobody has ever recommended shop because of it strict adherence to the rules
handful of selected products in various categories that are truly remarkable
thus speak the man who called his child moon unit
it isn wrong if you vent off frustations but almost any blog tries to offer solution which can be right or wrong or discussed etc this blog doesn offer one it simply rampages about the idiocy of creationism ok if america is composed of idiots what to do put them into asylum like the soviets put up some thought control to shephard them who should do that education isn helping much either look at drug control and educate youths about sexual abstination total failure the biker analogy was an example to be aware of the social regulations in which you live and which may block you from seeing it from different viewpoint if you are uneasy with this example have the impression that the usa is currently strongly divided between right and left concerning the arguments the left wing should be in the better position so why are they currently so under pressure are of all americans idiots

couldn explain it better so if an evolutionist shows anti social behaviour it will reinforce prejudice that evolution or even rationalism causes anti social behaviour that should be avoided because it alienates persons with specific views if someone has the opinion that worldview threatens something you love respect or admire you must reject it arguments are worthless in this case this is very dangerous weapon and the proponents of id uses them effectively they relate darwinism with isms of very bad reputation the article puts oil in the fire

no new ideas here but lemme just get this out there such child abuse can be partially alieviated by legalizing marijuana believe that marijuana is gateway drug simply because it is illegal obtaining weed usually acquaints you with suppliers of more hard drugs thus making you more likely to try them if marijuana was available at local herb shops you re just more likely to try exotic teas furthermore bet the government spends lot of time effort and money cracking down on marijuana those resources would be better spent on drugs that are actually addictive no marijuana is not addictive maybe addictive in the coffee or jelly donut sense but most certainly not in the heroin meth or crack sense

gt what other restrictions might be added later that could force me to go reformat and or rewrite thousands of lines of already working code python has an excellent backward compatibility record nobody talking about removing those features until python which makes no claims about being backward compatible and is at least few years away anyway if they re breaking backwards compatibility anyway why would they leave in language features that are slower and less readable than their preferred alternatives

no am saying the exact opposite of hxa hxa says that all puzzles are arbitrary am saying that number sequence puzzles are not arbitrary ordinary non mathematician humans will agree that the right answer to the puzzle is not amp pi but even if you produce some elaborate explanation of why it is amp pi and not they will still understand that you are just being an ass mathematicians will also understand that you are being an ass mathematicians spend plenty of research time on problems of this type for example you are given sequence of points find curve that passes through the points obviously there are many such curves in the impoverished world of the author of this article no further answer is possible because every one of the many curves is as good as another and yet better answers than this are possible mathematicians have invented cubic splines for example which have certain useful and valuable properties these properties are why cubic splines are better answer to the question than some curve chosen at random bezier splines are another possible answer while nobody would want to say that bezier curves were always better answer than cubic splines both of them are better answers than some random doodle involving amp pi so contrary to this author claim there are absolute reasons to consider one answer better than another many problems have multiple answers this does not make them ill posed or unanswerable in science you always have the choice of several different philosophical approaches to your work the creationist philosophy is to answer every question with because god made it that way why do we have grooves on our fingers because god made them that way why did god make them that way it mystery such philosophy is not scientifically useful or interesting it cannot lead to better understanding of the grooves an alternative philosophy is to consider the possibility that the grooves evolved through natural selection then you have the option to investigate the possible function of the grooves maybe the grooves make it easier for monkeys to hold clubs and the monkeys with grooves killed all the monkeys without grooves then you can go look for evidence and study the problem unlike because god made it that way this approach is not an immediate dead end it points the way to an increase in understanding the author philosophical approach is just as worthless as one that says the next number in the sequence is whatever god wills it to be instead of taking the commonsensical approach of observing that certain answers to certain number sequence problems are superior to other answers and attempting an honest inquiry into why this is so an inquiry that could result in many useful and interesting contributions to mathematical knowledge the author approach is to take the lazy way out and refuse to even consider the question and he has to work so hard to take the lazy way out he has to convince himself that amp pi is as good an answer to the question of what follows as is it takes powerful lot of brainpower to come up with such stupid idea don want to overstate the closeness of the comparison am making between the author lazy approach and the creationists there are many points at which there is no correspondence bring up creationism only to make the point that the author philosophical approach is just as intellectually bankrupt as creationism and for the same reasons faced with large class of potentially interesting questions it flushes the inquiries down the toilet

ycombinator invests so small amounts of cash that if was them would invest to almost any even remotely interesting idea usually vc need some percentage of their companies to succeed in order to be profitable because ycombinators investment is only tiny share of normal even seed phase investment they can invest to many more companies and be profitable with smaller succeeding percent basically what ycombinator is doing is that they are selling publicity for the company wow they have investment from paul graham and all in exchange for very small price for the share just my cents

well yeah it just forfeited revenue not profits but still it not like the actual cost of cup of coffee is it probably less than dollar ignoring labor and the coffee machine which are sunk costs anyway gas stations pay lot of money for gas and put pretty small mark up on it they try to make up for that by selling hot dogs for dollar etc so we can pretty much assume that even though he just making estimates about gross profits the general point still stands

yes he is from the article most software managers have no choice but to go along with performance review systems that are already in place if you re in this position the only way to prevent teamicide is to simply give everyone on your team gushing review but if you do have any choice in the matter recommend that you run fleeing from any kind of performance review incentive bonus or stupid corporate employee of the month program and at least two dozen studies over the last three decades have conclusively shown that people who expect to receive reward for completing task or for doing that task successfully simply do not perform as well as those who expect no reward at all so yes bonuses are also there

few years ago decided to try this and stopped washing my hair completely for several months it true that it goes to balanced state that isn particularly greasy or gross however it will pick up odours that water alone will not remove if you go to smoky bar the smell of cigarette smoke will linger in it which is kind of nasty so recommend washing it once every weeks also will use just conditioner every days because it makes it smell nice and also cleans it somewhat perfect for the day after the bar wouldn have written all that but hey you wanted to read comments on story about it so you kinda asked for it

very nice some are quite humorous here we see for sure that often times humor is found in truth
my cents the thing that strikes me about the combinator except the reddit hype is the similarity to google labs many features all in beta only few useful ipo as exit is nowadays pretty much closed so the only other option open is merger biggest buyer in town is google so why not start companies with the sole purpose of being bought by google that what think combinator is all about going for google as an exit

first of all don think this guy is an engineer or scientist so don think that he represents us all but yes most of us in evolutionary biology do tend to think that id is absolutely ridiculously stupid and we have hard time conceiving how anyone intelligent could believe in it when you spend as much time as we do studying evolution it understandable to feel that way when am confronted by an intelligent well researched opposition to evolution then will be happy to listen and have discussion about it that however has yet to happen what drives me nuts is that most id proponents come up with these utterly stupid arguments like the eye is too complicated to have evolved randomly that just prove how little they understand don feel guilty for believing that the members of the flat earth society are idiots and won feel guilty for feeling that way about most intelligent designees

and what of the people who are certain they worked like crap the last year like they were off their game like they sucked ass who get some great review and rating and then look around at teammates they thought worked harder who are getting bad reviews it just sucks everything about it sucks also frustrating is when the payout of your personal performance bonus is heavily tied to the overall business performance as one of say several thousand software engineers at the bottom have this personal effect on how effective the sales marketing and architecture teams have been coming up with and selling the product they had you build it doesn matter how well you build widget to its specifications if nobody wants widget according to those specifications yet we get hugely graded on how well widget sells really bad is when you are competing with teammates for the same piece of the bonus pie good way to generate comraderie and synergy phbs
that great reminds of of those chalk drawings saw while ago
same here went from shampooing my hair every day to about once every week or two with no gross factor do still wash my hair every day though just not with shampoo it seem peculiar to me that would wash all the natural oils out of my hair then replace them immediately with product to style it when if just washed with water my hair was clean but didn need to cover it with shite to keep it from going fuzzy
it is certainly better for sales than some parts of the company but am not sure that setting teammates up to compete against each other for the same piece of limited bonus pie is great idea either you should be competing against another company not each other

it is amusing how far the religious have slid in their determined efforts to keep god in science they must long for the days when they could just lock up the galileos historical impediments thrown at the advancement of science by religion are eventually overcome yours is just modern emasculated version in world where religion has long been laughed out of the serious scientific ring the holes you are now left with to enter god as the explanation are getting smaller and smaller

as much as dislike microsoft tried to look at these screenshots objectively and in the end did recognize big improvement in usability of course as much as can recognize without actually using it if that even counts it easier to predict where things will be in the toolbar now whereas before all toolbar icons were treated as equals one thing microsoft never seems to pick up on when borrowing visual styles is subtlety as an example take os titlebar gradients they re quite noticeable but if you check out color difference in the gradient the gap is extremely smaller than one would guess microsoft just seems to go with their initial instinct about visual styles and ends up with something wildly exaggerated that guarantee people will get sick of after month

lt blockquote gt the court has said that their right to privacy means that they can do what they please with their bodies lt blockquote gt ve always found this right to do what they please with their bodies phrase to be one of the most confusing of the entire abortion debate maybe you or someone else here can clarify to me what it means because think it the way interpret it the following two things make it seem incorrect even if it were clear that fetus is part of woman own body it is obvious that people don have the right to do what they want with their own bodies you don have the right put your hands over someone throat so that the person suffocates to death you don have the right to put your body in the path of moving vehicle you don even have the right to slit your wrists and kill yourself and you can be hospitalized if doctor thinks you might on less extreme terms you don have right to put your body where you want breaking amp entering and trespassing laws use it to move air in the way you want screaming fire in crowded theater use it to take what you want theft etc in fact most every law in modern societies restricts what person can do with his or her own body it is not clear that fetus is woman own body from genetic standpoint each cell in it descends from only half of her genetic material which sets them apart from every other cell in her body from this perspective it as much the father body as the mother from physical standpoint the fetus is not connected to her body and her blood does not flow through it like the rest of her body the placenta is implanted on the wall of the uterus but the part of it that is genetically descended from the fetus is not part of the mother body of course the fetus proper is suspended in the amniotic sac and is not attached at all to the mother body so can make any sense of the right to do what she wants with her own body phrase can someone explain it to me

have worked in both sales and engineering at least in sales you have an objective measurement for that single individual contribution in nearly all other positions in company the measurement is partly or mostly subjective have worked at couple of places that give the engineers bonuses and almost uniformly everyone is disgruntled unless they get the maximum even if the bonus is determined by some objective measurement like profit or division performance the comment is usually its not my fault our sales division performance sucked so to most it is simply part of their salary to me it sure looks like bonuses are negative influence

people need to stop launching web applications when they are still months away from being useful and bug free this remark is valuable in the sense of being perfectly wrong one of the great advantages of web based apps is that you can launch them quickly and listen to what sophisticated early adopters think this page is evidence of the value of that everyone is complaining about the flash requirement bet the wufoos are thinking seriously about it if they waited months to launch that would have meant waiting months longer to learn about this problem the longer you wait to launch the more deeply your initial mistakes will be imbedded in your product

reddit makes money the same uh how way google did it much harder to make something that gets million users than to figure out how to make money from something that has million users the first is so hard that few succeed the second is so easy that can think of one that failed so we tell founders to concentrate on the first it worked for google in and infrastructure costs are way lower now

agree with you that the analogy to abortion confuses the issue and your point about adoption illustrates the lesser choice of men better unless misunderstand the woman is allowed to put up the baby for adoption or not if she decides to keep the child she can obligate the man to pay child support if he wants to put up the child for adoption instead of support the child the courts don care that is the basic inequity here wonder what happens if the woman wants to put up the baby for adoption and the man wants to obtain custody and raise the child can he force her to pay child support if anything be tempted to change that aspect of the law to equal things out
showing frustration when arguing point is unscientific not rational
from wikipedia intelligent design id is the concept that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause not an undirected process such as natural selection its leading proponents all of whom are affiliated with the discovery institute say that intelligent design is scientific theory that stands on equal footing with or is superior to current scientific theories regarding the origin of life pure and simple id theories are not science because they cannot be tested by experiment do not generate any predictions and propose no new hypotheses of their own yet the discovery institute claims id is scientific theory at least on equal footing with the current theory of evolution it not presenting id as scientific theory is manipulative and misleading it preys on the general public ignorance think the majority of people don really get natural selection and as such can truly grok the process they fall back on simpler more convenient explanation god did it which several hundred years ago at least was the explanation for everything lightning god did it disease god did it but there no strength no scientific rigor to those answers because they cannot be tested by experiment do not generate any predictions and propose no new hypotheses of their own science has slowly marginalized religion everyday relevence because it just plain better at answering why fundamental tenant of evangelical christians is that the bible is perfect and without error well that year old explanation of the origin of man has been usurped by better theory lot of powerful people have lot to lose if the current evolutionary theory is as widely accepted as most other scientific theories id is essentially shitty product with really good marketing

first of all was just trying to very briefly summarize my understanding of roe vs wade the point was that it isn about women having right to control subsequent consequences of intimacy that said gt so can make any sense of the right to do what she wants with her own body phrase sure you can you disagree with it and the point isn that the fetus is her own body the point is that her uterus is if you needed my kidney to survive get to turn you down it is to me similar principle not really interested in longer debate right now ve been through two such debates recently on slashdot http slashdot org comments pl sid amp threshold amp commentsort amp mode nested amp pid and on reddit http reddit com info id and neither of them got anywhere
don feel guilty for believing that the members of the flat earth society are idiots and won feel guilty for feeling that way about most intelligent designees while science provides partial basis for deciding truth truth is fundamentally about social networks the flat earth society is idiots not because of what they believe in but because they have failed to spread their meme we re currently treating intelligent design like just another crackpot theory but when the number of adherents grows to large number you have to switch tack
friend of friend know know worked for while in social services and her boss classic question which had to be posed for each policy decision was what about the stupid people at first she thought it was horrible and elitist then she realized it was just practical there are lot of people out there just making bad choices and number of them end up with kids very very sadly for all involved
didn assume that she lied considered what it would mean if she did or if she did not lie
think that the person who has the option of putting the child up for adoption would be the legal guardian don know what the current system is for determining the legal guardian and don know whether there are any problems with it so yes gt unless misunderstand the woman is allowed to put up the baby for adoption or not think you misunderstand gt if anything be tempted to change that aspect of the law to equal things out but you have no idea what the law is or whether there is any inequity at all certainly don

agreed that not bad thing we re all human blobs of neurons swimming in cocktail of chemicals we re all given to irrationality when we stand up and say yes am stupid but want to find the truth we ll be much more likely to arrive at consensus the ideal of proving theorem to convince your opponent that just truth is sufficient to spread meme is not just unrealistic but wrong

wow good show this is an episode of days the fx show loosely based on the movie supersize me where christian guy named david from west virginia agrees to live as muslim in michigan it is an entertaining introduction to islam and pretty good look at the life of muslims in america david was an excellent subject he was candid about his reservations but he seemed open and free of hate unlike some of the people on the street who were also interviewed on the show think he was good representative for the average american his education was fascinating to watch
gt sure you can you disagree with it that pretty out of left field and clearly not true but if you don want to explain the phrase you used that fine maybe someone else will gt and the point isn that the fetus is her own body the point is that her uterus is since the abortion methods aware of don intentionally do anything to the uterus that doesn seem very relevant for the record think there are several compelling arguments for the legality and moral correctnes of abortion but the right to her own body line confuses me

wash my hair with shampoo about once every month after particularly drunken night out in smoky place or some days hiking shower every day and really do scrub my hair but only with water shampoo is the great lie it really is my hair is absolutely fine in fact it quite fine if have to say so myself when do use shampoo it fucks my hair up on day to then it recovers but do have quite short hair and sure experience different results if had longer hair also can echo the soft water commnent made earlier when somewhere with hard water have to use shampoo or it just goes hard for lack of better word

what think was missing here and if remember correctly is in demarco and lister is that team awards can boost productivity from personal experience also in software can say that even smaller gestures towards showing team their work is appreciated is significant of course if you then see that the managers all get flown to hawaii it loses something don know can see the problems but think you need some mechanism for rewarding people who are working harder finding the german system of getting raise for doing little and for excelling pretty motivation destroying the typical software system had in canada at electronic arts was frustrating too though so not sure what can be done occasionally it was okay though it generally depended on the manager and there was at least the feeling of being able to influence things

how long have people been asking for this is it going to happen is it definitely not going to happen and we should stop asking would be good to know
no
quick disclaimer wrote this blog and though typically don believe in shameless self promotion by submitting my articles and blog posts to sites like reddit and digg did want to post this one since am really hoping to get as many good suggestions as possible so please look over the blog or if you like skip reading the blog and just post your comment am hoping to use the collective knowledge of the web to find the absolute best information on both of these languages
can people take second and understand these companies are like weeks old saw one the other day that had built an entire stock trading system for pete sake we need to give these guys break also it fairly clear if you actually think for minute before flaming what some of these business plans are or at least will attempt to be woofoo they ll likely charge for people to make forms or license their stuff to companies pixoh those guys are going to get bought or they can license the technology to any number of blogging or online photo sites inkling transaction fees selling to corporations to use this stuff do you know how much companies pay for complete garbage and this would actually help them flagr ad revenue sponsorships for physical bookmarks look no paul graham apologist and get frustrated like everyone else going to site that requires flash and is nothing more than ui demo couldn even look at it so perhaps they did launch too early but please be realistic and be human critiques are great but words like this is crap are ridiculous do you like it when your boss or friend tells you your work is crap after you surely slaved over it for weeks and weeks like these startups are surely doing

the point isn gas stations per se just like who moved my cheese isn to be taken literally the point is that your customer service behavior has repercussions well beyond the current transaction it like the classic stew leonard story about the woman who returned spoilt milk only to have stew sr argue with her that it couldn be newly purchased and be spoiled already she stormed out and never returned stew then realized the lifetime value of the customer lost and made up that silly rock that sits in the entranceway of all his stores rule customer is always right rule if the customer is wrong refer to rule as for brand customer loyalty for gas stations you re wrong to some degree don buy certain brands because of perceived quality and others because of customer service if don find someone significantly cheaper than my station regardless of proximity go to my preferred station and it not the closest obviously where am at the time run low plays role too is there as much customer loyalty in gas stations as there is in other things probably not but scratch most consumers and you ll find they have preferred station not necessarily preferred brand although sure familiarity breeds some preference for example until got the hess visa back on gas purchases bought from mobil when was in ct good quality decent price and liked the convenience of speedpass wasn the closest station but its locations weren bad once we moved to nj we hadn developed any real preference there were or areas with decent prices and everything is full service although we tended to look at this one independent who had pleasant attendants and wasn too far from the house so is it really strong loyalty no is it loyalty yes eric the piece author

gt if you don want to explain the phrase you used that fine the last paragraph of my comment is somewhat explanatory the exact issue you bring up is thoroughly discussed in both of the linked threads gt since the abortion methods aware of don intentionally do anything to the uterus that doesn seem very relevant obviously they do they empty the uterus if you would like to nitpick further on that issue you are being twit if pregnancy didn have anything to do with woman body then would not be opposed to anti abortion legislation you have right to medical procedure that would remove something unwanted from your body especially one that had effects as extreme as pregnancy you think that right is trumped by the right of the fetus to live don think that forcing woman to supply her body to her fetus for months is perhaps lesser intrusion than forcing you to give me your kidney but an intrusion of the same kind violation of your right to your body this of course has nothing to do with roe vs wade see there go didn want to spend minutes on comment identical to one that wrote last week

grain of salt is cliche that undermines the heart of your concern which believe is critical thinking everything should be approached with critical thinking not just the amount of credibility the person has but the strength of their ideas when somebody is giving accounts of personal experiences how can you ever know they are telling the truth you just have to balance it critically with everythign else you know and if what they say falls compeletly out of your world view it should prompt further exploration not just staunch disbelief
thing like visual studio kdevelop any of dozen ides you know one of the things that other people use and quite few of them at that nothing much other than emacs and microemacs which sure loads bucketload faster uses emacs keys that the primary reason non zealots have problems with this type of editor whether vi emacs or otherwise would probably not mind vi so much if could actually nativate with arrow keys and type or so without having to be afraid that just put it into mode in which everything will explode then save sure people use emacs because some functionality is just damn useful like the way emacs makes basic editing just pretty nice and without the need for menus intending syntax highlighting which more than once acts dumb but you live with that sure anyone is willing to take some dents in intuitiveness that pretty much always fact of life with computers or they spend so much time in it that they sort of have to implicitly hate all other editors because they re so icky and different and don have the features at least not in the way you expect them to be

gt quite few of the algorithms in my bioinformatics class use dynamic programming have no idea how this would be done in haskell guess you do dynamic programming in any functional language the way you write any iterative program by passing along the state local variables in which you re memoizing the partial results as arguments to recursive calls that really the right way to do it in ocaml as well if you re using mutable cells instead you re not really programming in functional style and it harder to rigorously reason about the correctness of your program for example computing the th fibonacci number in int fibonacci int int while int return the same thing in ml fun fibonacci let fun fibhelper fibhelper fibhelper in fibhelper end according to wikipedia http en wikipedia org wiki though you don even need to do dynamic programming in haskell because the absolute functional purity of haskell allows it to do it for you gt some functional programming languages most notably haskell can automatically memoize the result of function call with particular set of arguments in order to speed up call by name evaluation this mechanism is referred to as call by need this is only possible for function which has no side effects which is always true in haskell but seldom true in imperative languages now that truly impressive

gt except that lisp could be perfect think this haunts everyone who touches lisp and really gets it still maintain that lisp needs strong benevolent dictator la the perl ruby and python models who can get things done on the implementation side break with the monolithic ansi standard and present unified front on all major platforms don see these things happening by committee without making the language proprietary hoped we see paul graham assume this role with arc especially since his street cred could go long way toward creating something more than yet another splinter but we ve not heard peep about arc in quite while granted they reserve the right to take very long time but it makes one wonder if the candle inside the black box hasn gone out take crack at it myself but need to solve the money problem first which incidentally think is probably better done with language other than lisp at this juncture not to mention that need lot more calls to the old get_smarter function before even considering something so arrogant

true but we can live with windows better macs always worked better that way yup it just that linux does it worse than both it not so much interface elements talking about both gnome and kde are rather neat these days have been for some time and like the way kde is going with the integration and more logical structure than windows it has too many damn buttons still don know the meaning of though they said they go the mac way in kde but talking about the amount of things they take care of user geared stuff plug in device windows gives you thumbs up or thumbs down rather than forcing you to look around var log and proc or curse at an iffy hotplug setup only few major distros handle that nicely and ve seen two of them try to open my usb stick in window only to choose the wrong directory rather silly network ip collision linux undramatically just doesn work in windows you get little pop up that as recall leads you to repair and tells you to bug your admin if that hopeless actually my network script won set up eth on my server have to ifconfig it manually can really tell what wrong because the error message refers to the config format as it was half year ago that exactly the sort of thing you don ever drop on everyday users whose distinction is does work doesn work dammit if ms did anything remotely like that it would cause shitstorms and extensive namecalling in every self respecting geek forum loves me my linux but it could do with some more intuitiveness

regular ocaml user ve even been paid to do so at some point know haskell quite well although never had professional position involving it are there any apart from teaching haskell definitely teaches enlightening stuffs and everyone should have learned it so that he writes better code in other languages as esr said about lisp but being purely functional is terrible hassle in most real cases comfortable with monads and even use them in non haskell projects when suitab le but it has to be recognised for what it is design pattern and fairly heavy one mean completely agree with haskell people when they cry over the heaviness of visitor patterns in say java it just unbearable once you ve tried language which supports algebraic datatypes yet monadic are just contrived way to shoehorn imperative thinking into functional framework exactly the way visitor pattern is contrived way to shoehorn data deconstruction in an oo framework ocaml makes it quite easy to separate between functional and imperative bits yet if you do want to mix them at some point you can and in an application there always that little sub problem that essentially imperative and which will cripple the whole system should you shoehorn it in monad ocaml avoids this as an example look at spj template haskell meta programming framework in haskell the whole api is polluted with many subtly different versions of syntax tree constructors because there is complicated monadic system underneath and what all this monadic behemoth for the point is to cleanly handle generator_ yes that stupid gensym thing come on when it comes to laziness sure it allows extremely witty and terse bits of code on some selected subjects but at the cost of difficult to assess execution path and algorithmic complexity personnaly prefer the eager by default lazy if you ask approach one finds in ocaml rather than the opposite found in haskell guess it depends on the kind of problems you consider typical but of people will find that eager by default works best as for syntax completely agree with the post haskell is by far the most elegant syntax ve ever met although some might argue that lisp has its own special elegance and ocaml one is bit awkward but you get used to it and it is customisable with the camlp parser

well could sympathize with the emotional upheaval if someone can recognize glaringly contradictions but think it is more than stupidity involved cite but yes most of us in evolutionary biology do tend to think that id is absolutely ridiculously stupid and we have hard time conceiving how anyone intelligent could believe in it you know richard dawkins what do you think of his intellectual capabilities now richard believes please correct me if am wrong that ideas which he called memes can infest our brains and infect others via communication do you think that it is viable scientific theory or hypothesis with can be falsified tested or proved thing as meme which shares with god invisibility untouchability lack of matter or energy and which is still able to influence most of short lived changes in human behaviour like language art etc etc and according to occams razor why introduce such thing if there are many other more sophisticated theories about the change in human behaviour which don need such thing tell me the difference between id and memes and yes in your mind you can think everything you like but if you cannot avoid fes members what about sorry please respect that don want to discuss with you

if you don believe in such thing as objective truth then why bother arguing if you believe in such thing as objective truth you re one step closer to believing you re in possession of it so of course anybody who argues with you is stupid wrong satanic perhaps you would prefer me to phrase it thus yes there is an objective truth but we ll never find it all we have to come close to it with is our social networks even science that thing which can do no wrong depends crucially on the review process on convincing others that what you re saying makes sense and is interesting without an audience to keep us honest our minds can rationalize anything practicality is clearly important not going to argue with every crackpot notion out there it not worth my time but if competing meme has enough people backing it and who wins has an impact on our lives then it is worth our time to try to arrive at consensus and you will never arrive at consensus by being sure you re right consensus is not compromise doubt can be convinced that the world was built in days but if want to convince someone else otherwise have to first understand his belief system intimately in the process am sure from past experience that will learn something and wouldn learn it if was sure from the start that he was an idiot or fucking moron that everything thought was right fucking moron yourself now can we leave the name calling out of it

if you find yourself in conflict with someone over something you care about you have options trying to understand each other or competing with them for resources the latter usually involves war in this case civil war genocide and the like there is no third option perhaps you don like war perhaps you are content to show that your children will outcompete theirs economically well guess what if they manage to change the education system like they want to your children will likely suffer myself would prefer for us to understand each other and don think of it as conversion either to think their belief system has nothing to offer you is arrogance

diggs increasing popularity is also its akilles heel stories making it to the front page are much more likely to get diggfucked bandwidth exceeded the more users digg gets while getting many hits is fun for the story writer it creates frustration when you click the link and get error server too busy pretty soon the stories will be pushed out from the front page without ppl beeing able to read them

doesn putting firefox in the title kind of ruin the joke
didn mean to imply was pointing just at you show frustration too in fact agree about message vs messenger was merely trying to highlight similiarities between us and them my point is that we are all fundamentally equally irrational the armies of people on both sides of this debate myself included haven really spent huge amount of time on average thinking about it therefore there is less difference than you might realize between your belief in science and someone else belief in religion like daniel dennett said http reddit com info id kv if you delegate to experts recuse yourself from the argument only he was applying it selectively to the other side one reason everyone in on this in militant fashion is that the experts on either side have failed to respond maturely to each other one can hardly expect religion to be undogmatic but the scientific establishment really needs to learn to listen to unscientific perspectives when they can affect the world hold my side to higher standard hoping all my posts in this thread will help people to triangulate on it if they care
very dissapointed with the militant behaviour firefox zealots came across site that wouldn allow anyone without firefox browser to view it contents now someone hijacks the ie com domain name and puts gaint firefox logo common now how juvenile is that
in some cases titles make big difference in other cases think it just due to randomness of whether the first few viewers liked it or not if post fails to garner positive votes in the first few hours it pretty much destined for mediocrity or worse as later users are unlikely to give it much attention due to low scores

survey research is always risky in this case it is important to realize that the responses and the facts may or may not agree specifically is it the case that of high school dropouts were passing their classes and left out of boredom maybe but showing that say this was the case and verifying through school records that it was the case are different things indeed this particular topic lends itself to serious response bias issues did you drop out because you were bored or failing for the respondent who was in fact failing one response is honest and the other saves face sure it is the case that some students leave school because it seems irrelevent because it boring or because of social torment and or oppression in addition would wager that many of the kids who are failing are doing so precisely because school is boring and oppressive however this article who knows about the original paper and study do not clearly separate these issues too bad

the thing dislike most about digg is the entire attitude behind it kevin rose goes around hyping it they got million in vc funding and now they are buying offices and have ceo give me break digg is site full of year olds with uninspired uninteresting comments and cool stories like monkey nintendo emulator for the sony psp we don even need to mention its gaudy interface or the vigilante mob justice that has occured on digg several times some against innocent people or maybe we should mention those things digg is pinnacle example of the ridiculousness of web site that uses ajax and is broken to those without javascript enabled and has large but immature community is getting ton of focus and raking in the money from investors its website that could be recreated in less than day and in its current shape it will never interest more than very limited set of people yet for some reason it has ceo and now has its own office space that just ridiculous that the dot com bust all over again for you

looking at the source was enlightening for me learnt new tag that is still valid but somehow haven come across before lt address gt http www schools com tags tag_address asp it also quite reassuring to see that the page still displays exactly as it was intended in few years later was making sites with tables and probably naively using ie specific markup which now look completely heinous another example of why adhering to standards increases the longevity of your data
well it statement of something arguably not fashion
agree and another side effect of its popularity is that the comments pages have become major bandwidth hogs like to read the comments but they take an age to load at least in the past few weeks after they updated their comment system the numerous sweet digg comments get down voted and buried pretty quickly but one feature seems to be missing that would make it genuinely useful reddit style comment system where upvoted comments and threads emerge to the top of the page that way there wouldn be comments saying the same thing sitting at the bottom

are ycombinator only interested in mass market apps thinking there more mileage in creating services for more narrowly defined markets which also chimes with the trend for producing simple narrowly defined apps to solve more specific problems it more traditional approach engineering yourself into existing markets rather than trying to create new ones by chasing eyeballs which was basically the dotcom strategy obviously the mass market snowball approach can succeed well but it also ignores lot of potential prizes out there

memes can be tested on humans and then the results can be weighed against the original hypotheses and see if it adds up while you cannot physically see memes occuring sound waves actually exist the brain will actually record the sound waves and again will try to spread it you can try to pinpoint what seems to spread from person to person try to duplicate an idea in lap with humans and see if it spreads this is all of course theory but the fact remains it can be tested if it gets thoroughly vetted then itll start appearing in text books right alongside evolution until then it stays with richard dawkins id cannot be tested you either believe higher power exists or you dont now cmon be honest with yourself if aliens visited us tomorrow and said we are higher power that altered your genetic code thus id is correct and we are the ones that guided your evolution your arguement would simply change to jesus god created the aliens that in turn created us

think this site is misguided it nifty technology and it may solve problems people have such as taking form data which can be pain for small site owners but those small site owners have hard enough time with frontpage and we re tossing them out there to make form from scratch this site should be guiding people through the creation of the form not just making it easy to make one from scratch otherwise people won pay for it to succeed think wufoo needs to guide people through creating common types of forms the same way office apps guide you through creating common documents hand hold the person to default form and then let them customize it no form should start blank and if they do that think they ll succeed at least if they are priced reasonably

just bunch of broken links for me
yes the point being bliss routine works as fusion of juggling and musical interpretation the body motion that garfield so loathes as poor juggling form is all part of the show jason garfield whose technical skills are light years beyond bliss is fixated on the lack of difficulty rather suspect his ego can handle moderate three ball routine getting standing ovation

about fucking time guess people have finally had enough
seems to me like the guy is doing some reddit whoring just because his articles have been popular here the article is biased towards reddit amp not an acceptable polemic digg bashing on reddit too is quite immature any mention of digg amp the comments are strewn with digg bashing their users are good at digging the internet for new articles many links from the front page of digg make it to reddit everyday reddit is great because the community is quite esoteric in its tastes the communities that visit these two sites are quite different amp that fact should be accepted

anybody who wants to view website add free can do so trivially by using firefox installing greasemonkey http greasemonkey mozdev org and either writing or finding http www google com search grease monkey scripts scripts to remove such ads that doesn make ads useless it just means that your ads need to not annoy users too much strong argument for google inoffensive text ads my point is that people can already get rid of ads if they want to but this doesn seem to stop google from making money from advertising it just means that sites have to be careful about how they advertise

this is true but they probably would have got far more useful criticism using slightly older slightly more common version of flash then more people would be able to make detailed responses about the interface options available etc because they could actually see what it does
gt why not use flash because it plugin believe more users will be able willing to run javascript than install third party plugin don have the stats and too lazy to google them perhaps somebody could help out here heck my intuition might well be wrong security see it plugin javascript is sandboxed making it much safer for the user than some arbitrary binary that can afaik among other things write to the user hard drive sure there might be bug in the browser that makes javascript security hole but you have that anyway using flash just needlessly introduces another potential attack vector it may be easier for javascript the term ajax is gross misnomer to manipulate the dom and play well with other web ish things here not sure perhaps someone with more flash experience can tell me how well flash plays with other javascript etc certainly applet lt gt javascript communication is was excruciatingly painful and terribly buggy suspect others can find more reasons
think myrddine has made really good point here can see this technology appealing in the slightest to web application developers but perhaps the target market is something more like small site owners if that the case think myrddine makes very good case for changing the app to be geared towards that market

hey there fairlyodd seems to me like the guy is doing some reddit whoring intended nothing of the sort and not really sure how you read that into it indeed it was just throw away entry after seeing yet another site give up some stats about how they prospered from front page of digg and once again the numbers came in far under what would have estimated based upon some other publicized numbers in no way was bashing digg it is possible that digg users as group are more likely to have the alexa toolbar possibly because group of very verbal digg enthusiasts have made the alexa rankings critical element of their evangelism if you re eager to see your site pass slashdot for instance you re probably more likely to install the toolbar that will help the cause and it does seem like reddit users use reddit more as bookmarks and thus follow more of the links and digg users use it more as destination itself speaking generally of course
that my point there is no conversion at least for the ones who claim to be educated on the subject can argue with an id er until blue in the face about how the eye evolved but eventually they will be able to find something that don happen to know the answer to and they will thus feel that their point is proven once someone has decided to believe in intelligent design they can always claim that the simpler explanation is that god did it
and if you watch garfield cruiseship video you will see that he is very good at being dick he seems genuinely resentful that people don take juggling and more specifically his juggling more seriously

why write about such an important topic with such sensationalism what is the goal of your writing to enlighten others as to your position on the issues in cherry picking facts interpretations of events and the views of others you are doing exactly the same as those that you have most issue with by avoiding even the acknowledgement that there is or could be alternative readings or interpretations of the events about which you write you are highlighting yourself to the moderate majority as being part of the lunatic fringe that exists to both the right and the left of issues such as these obviously this daniel pipes chap is one of these lunatics any rational person reading his commentary can work that out for themselves pretty easily but many will come to the same conclusion about you by reading yours honestly some of your stuff is creeping into david icke super intelligent reptiles rule the world territory but then again might just be one of those reptiles writing comments such as these as part of global conspiricy aiming to cover up our existence and intentions the truth is out there

would argue that post we have many if not all of the conditions necessary for dictatorship the government can detain people without warrants and hold them in secret without trial indefinitely can eavesdrop on the citizenry in secret with no independent oversight can now publicly declare that dissent is seditious has credible reason to assert these powers these powers are held by the least transparent branch of the government that is in command of the army and law enforcement forces and where all the control is concetrated in the hands of few people at the top don mean to say that we live in dictatorship now or that the government has abused these powers though don know what they ve done do you only mean to say that without these powers you can have totalitarian state but with them you can pre hitler stalin mussolini could get elected president but would be hard pressed to tilt this country into totalitarianism and now don know think its not an insignificant possibility do strongly believe that with these powers in place indefinitely every passing year makes dictatorship more and more likely

interesting list of news sources as the number of social collaborative filtering sites increases the meta aggregation idea certainly seems to make sense of course there are already sites like diggdot http diggdot us but this seems gives little more benefit than merely using an rss aggregator it would useful if meta aggregator could identify correlations between sources or find clusters of similar topics perhaps using machine learning methods in similar manner to google news it would also nice if the relative importance of various sites could be weighted either manually or via relevance feedback guess should get coding

wouldn be so sure of this the tech lead for nonprofit http www fictionalley org with registered users and our hits are about unregistered users for every registered one so possibly close to million users though that may be little misleading because of abandoned user accounts our revenues funded entirely by donations are about my day job however is startup with about customers and couple million dollars in revenue can tell you that the software at the professional gig is much more advanced and harder to write than the mass market website harder to write harder to duplicate so there less risk of competition coming in and taking away the users users will visit anything if it doesn cost them anything in money or attention it much harder to extract revenue from that even if it low fee because it requires that the user think about how much the service is worth to them take look at livejournal million users last checked but only about of them are paid accounts and lj has much stronger network effects and customer value than reddit doing the math that about million year enough to support person company but they re no google

just want to emphasize something you touched on it was noticed that turnstile jumpers often turn out to be wanted for much more serious crimes it sort of like how you go to singles bar when you want to find single people because the average person there is more likely to be what you re looking for looking for serious criminals try narrowing your search to those seen committing petty crimes

you sir are an idiot the other replies in this thread have said it correctly he didn flip flop here are some examples kerry voted against bill that included funding for body armor in that bill was lot of stuff that was good ie body armor but some things that were bad don recall what those were kerry voted no on the bill later he was asked if he was for body armor he said of course next day kerry flip flops on body armor kerry voted for the war but year later thought it was bad idea flip flop however the assessment year later was based on new information faulty cia intelligence to not reassess would be stupid but he was labeled flip flopper how you could not know these things given you use computer and presumably did in is amazing
once saw milosevic at the hague tribunal several years ago my class and had gotten vip tour of the court thanks to one of the judges from our home country when they brought milosovic in was totally surprised by the man presence he refused to look at the court or his accussers not out of guilt but just because he didn accept their jurisdiction over him his gaze was always on the audience had taken my headphones off because the court was in closed session when he looked at me and pointed at his head as if to ask if the headphones where off twitched to tell the truth and he shrugged and continued observing the people in the lounge it was truly interesting occassion

actually turning off the ignition will engage the steering column lock making it impossible to steer at all actually had this happen to me once and briefly couldn steer this was on curvy mountainous road on the way to fayetteville arkansas fortunately turning the key forward without engaging the ignition released the column lock but steering was still extremely difficult was an old olds cutlass and apparently the accelerator cable needed oil think newer auto trans cars probably won let you shut off ignition without getting it in neutral first hate cars that try to out think you also only ever buy manual transmission vehicles

my thoughts exactly gt the racing green reg car which mr nicolle had had for year has been examined by police and he has been told he will not face prosecution it doesn state if his bmw had an auto or manual tranny most likely manual just push down the ng clutch is it possible to yank the stick from one gear to another without pressing down the clutch this will blow up the gearbox but at least the car will stop
that was hilarious have you submitted that to reddit
he could just have turned the ignition to position the steering lock doesn engage at position the steering would have got very much heavier but it wouldnt have been impossible can imagine why the police aa didn tell him to do that once the engine was off he could have turned it back to position ii to make sure he had brake lights etc ieka car with disabled power steering will be much much heavier to steer than car without it in the first place

don worry people rarely read anything before spouting off the unsettling idea that our fellow countrymen tacit approval of trading liberty for security may eventually lead to trading all of our liberty away for security totalitarian regimes rarely have any problem with terrorism uprisings etc because they are picked up by informers long before fruition this troubles some people who figure that it always best to avoid questioning the president when in fact the constitution is all about the people rights to question everything about the government and assumes that it will be upheld by bloodshed if necessary russia went from democracy to totalitarianism in years what is to say that the united states cannot are we somehow better human beings than the russians or is it just matter of keeping our eyes open and revolting against that which is morally unacceptable secret domestic spying unfettered monarchy for the executive branch etc the most salient phrase in her interview to me was this we must be ever vigilant against those who would strongarm the judiciary into adopting their preferred policies to which would add whether man believes he is doing the right and just thing has little or nothing to do with whether his actions are in fact just the people of this country are the ones who stand to lose or gain by the im balance of powers in the government if congressional elections are as nakedly fraudulent in as the presidential elections have proven to be in florida in something has got to give or we might see the callow sheep in congress quietly standing by as their powers are dissolved by executive order not today not tomorrow but it could happen all it takes for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing

it is my understanding that this particular caliphate was so tolerant that the reigning caliph would regularly attend debates where muslim and christian scholars would openly debate each religion and the nature of god here is an excellent example of them working together another high point in the twelfth century was the collaboration of two scholars one christian and the other muslim on series of translations of dozens of works from arabic into latin by way of spanish the works included texts in astronomy medicine mathematics and philosophy the christian was gerard of cremona and his good friend and colleague was the muslim ghalib the mozarab and of jewish importance finally abu imran musa ibn maymun maimonides preeminent jewish philosopher of the middle ages was born in cordoba maimonides wrote his most famous work dalalat al ha ireen guide of the perplexed in arabic an attempt to reconcile jewish theology with muslim aristotelianism maimonides has been touted as one of the best examples of the mutual tolerance between muslims jews and christians that led to the cultural flowering in andalus in the medieval period however the fact is he was forced out of cordoba during purge by the puritanical muslim al mohads about after which he moved to cairo where he served as court physician to salah al din saladin and where he died it certainly seemed like the place to be at the time it is definitely fascinating

must try this
gt perhaps you would prefer me to phrase it thus yes there is an objective truth but we ll never find it nope that doesn help at all there is an objective reality outside of our understandings of it we absolutely can strive to understand it as best as possible so we will find parts of it all the time gt without an audience to keep us honest our minds can rationalize anything our minds can rationalize anything even with an audience attempting to keep us honest better to just leave it at our minds can rationalize anything and ll agree gt fucking moron yourself now can we leave the name calling out of it not if you try to say something like truth is fundamentally about social networks although ll admit to having said stupider things myself
it unfortunate that whoever replaces him will be just as bad without revolution america is doomed

huh don really see anywhere in the article where the author suggests that this is indicative of the attitudes of all anti choice people or statistically significant portion of them obviously the article is not and does not purport to be statistical analysis it is anecdotal exactly as you allege that does not mean that it doesn help the story it absolutely helps to understand the viewpoint of the people involved in the anecdotes and that is very very valuable no matter what your position is on abortion

the article is really excellent have been trying to tell people about this exact situation for long time but nowhere have found such succinct explanation those who have had faith in either the gop or the dems had better hang onto their hats as those two parties have collaborated on this every inch of the way to drive this country off cliff and they are still doing it people may think the libertarian party is just bunch of anarchists which is an incorrect perception but they are the largest agent for correcting this travesty in the country today neither the gop nor the dems have any interest in changing the country course if you really want change you are going to have to start voting libertarian at every available opportunity once we have slowed this train wreck down to more reasonable speed we can re open the debate as to the role of the government in the meantime the government has got to be stopped at all costs

many thanks to the pro life posters on this board as non religious pro lifer am often frustrated by the broken logic and random attacks that my side so often uses for an issue that is really rather direct and simple it is refreshing to see the tables turned it is heartening to see my side sticking to the issue while the other side flails all over the map to even say that these anicdotes are of any value has to either be complete failure of intellect or the result of completely biased point of view it tells nobody anything at all about the issue itself and handfull of anicdotes can hardly give anyone the slightest clue about group as large as the entire pro life movement

the point of the article was not to convince people that anti abortionists are stupid and hypocritical sure some of those women who seem to think that the only moral abortion is their own come off as misguided and hypocritical at no point did the article say here is proof that choice is better even though the author is pro choice herself it is merely exploring the responses of anti abortionist women who become pregnant and decide to have an abortion thousands of similar women will keep their babies attempting to say that anti abortionist women are hypocrites and therefore wrong is not the purpose of the article your argument is classic case of the straw man fallacy http en wikipedia org wiki straw_man

actually got into an argument about this with friend she pointed out that political views are more likely to be passed down to children than religious views the way she put it children are more likely to rebel against taught religion than they are against taught politics after awhile of thinking about it think she was right it something about the very deep moralistic aspects of politics that really seperate the love and nurture aspects of progressivism and the competition and survival of conservatism

as of right now the first sentence in the wikipedia article about him is gt slobodan milošević serbian слободан милошевић pronounced sloˈbodan miˈloʃevitɕ august march was serbian yugoslav leader and war criminal yeah know wikipedia is not authoritative and often articles aren neutral but this is just an example everywhere in the media we see him reported like this so forgive me if there small chance that he was an entirely innocent man but always thought it was given that he was guilty and that the trial was just formality besides even if he wasn guilty of killing hundreds of thousands the chances that he was entirely innocent of ordering any civilians killed are slim how likely is it that the un would ve conducted lengthy and expensive trial if they weren pretty much convinced of his guilt all for human rights and all and think that it would be wrong to imprison him without fair trial but here talking more about cosmic justice if you will it seems unjust that man who we all know is guilty even if we can prove it passed away peacefully in his old age when so many others were murdered in their prime because of him

ok ll post the link to your entry on the darwin awards when you re done
the article fails to explain why society oscillates between being liberal and being conservative the author argues that the liberal population exponentially decays and the conservative population grows exponentially then the population steadily shifts from liberal to conservative also some percentage of conservatives will neglect their patriarchal duties and for our purposes turn liberal if this percentage is constant then there will be some equilibrium where the change due to difference in birth rate is offset by negligent conservatives something is missing in the model to cause cyclic liberal conservative trends

ahi did not say that milosovic ordered atrocities my last two sentences where more general staments the fact is milosovic was the figurehead of serbian nationalism and the drive for greater serbia in my opinon both these causes where just way to gain power for him yet do belive he did know that his people where comitting crimes against humanity but did nothing to stop them as it was against his personal interests once talked to lawyer who was once affiliated with the hague tribunal and this person was convinced that the court didn have any evidence against milosovic personally at all

look you re wrong here you implied that the fact that milosevic is dead leads to the logical conclusion that his doctors were incompetent when this is obviously bullshit as millions of people die each year in the hands of fully competent doctors death is fact of life then you sarcastically claimed that nobody ever dies because doctors are incompetent as though you were refuting claim that doctors are never responsible for their patients death however travisxt had in fact only taken issue with your earlier lapse in logical reasoning and had in no way implied that doctors incompetence is never reason for patient death two pretty serious lapses there man really don think that gwenhwyfaer is being delusional here don know if spelling this out for you has actually achieved anything there certain level of intelligence below which people are unable to comprehend their own inability to correctly perceive the world blindly believing themselves to be in the right but you seem fairly literate so here to hoping you ll understand

don think it unreasonable to perceive your earlier comment gt given to understand that milosevic is perfectly dead as suggesting that milosevic death could only have happened because of incompetence guess you ll disagree but that the way read it and that formed the basis of my taking issue with your logic whatever suppose it just comes down to whether your remark is interpreted as serious refutation or as throwaway comment

gt we men tend to define womans sense of humor by how much she laughs at our jokes and not the other way around don think the word woman even belongs on this statement do you have any proof having sense of humor male or female has as much to do with being able to take joke as being able to deliver one and for the record her spot in the aristocrats is the prime example of what was running through my mind when wrote my previous expert evaluation of her
used to get into arguments over iraq with conservative americans including some vets from the first gulf war who in one breath would ask don you think iraqis deserve to be free of dictator like saddam and in the other call arabs sand niggers and mouth off about turning the desert into glass never once bought the notion that americans were in iraq for the good of iraqis as result

wrong memes cannot be tested and will explain why can write much about it but lack of space and perhaps interest will secure that keep concise first to test meme transferral we must come to an agreement what memes are actually are and how to identify them correct anti id rightfully pointed out that id remain suspiciously vague who the designer is if someone claims they are aliens we have the question who created the aliens chicken egg problem god is supernatural solution and is useless because it can explain every secret and is therefore no explanation at all so what are memes dawkins explained them as an analogy to viral code in computers information which can replicate itself so in case of humans they are thoughts dawkins even goes so far that religions are bad memes now how are we going to get sure that memes exist in case of computer viruses this is easy we can write down the binary code looks what it does according to the processor and see that it is capable to replicate itself we cannot look into someone brains we can locate currents and temperature and activity of special zones but that aren thoughts so we are forced to rely on speech and writings alone what dawkins will call meme transfer isn much more than talking with other people now if the meaning of meme has any sense at all it must divide talking into irrelevant talking and meme transfer otherwise you give talking just another synonym gt occam define successful meme transfer as example we take the word meme itself is it when people understand the concept but misheard it uh these mimoses infect my brain if the people spelled it correctly but don understand it memes are new biological organism which are transferred by sound waves if people like in urban legends attach own personal additions and worldviews to it memes are apart from their dawkins meaning holistic spirits which are engulfed in our soul come up with definition how to detect memes and memes transfer and will tear it apart in no time concerning strictness repeatability and falsifiability it is junk science and no am not id proponent but id is embarassingly for dawkins and in contrast to your assumption testable because the term irreducibly complex is defineable so the opponents of id who take it earnest haven said that the concept of ic is not falsifiable which would be wrong but that functions may develop from unintended side effects or that gradual development may have in fact positive effect on survival which is not evidently at the first moment or the possibility of mutation with the intended effect is grossly underestimated

there is an objective reality outside of our understandings of it we absolutely can strive to understand it as best as possible so we will find parts of it all the time all saying is that we ll never have all of it so we keep looking when think have it all will roll over and die our minds can rationalize anything even with an audience attempting to keep us honest better to just leave it at our minds can rationalize anything and ll agree not offering guarantees here that an audience will keep you from groupthink an audience is huge help on average the review process is the fundamental difference between science and alchemy before it stand by my original statement rephrased the truth of proposition is more confidently established when it is exposed to scrutiny in social network if you re having trouble with this scrutiny you have choices either change the proposition not single atomic fact but subgraph of the semantic network or change the social network in this case changing the social network seems poor option because it would involve civil war secession genocide so we need to understand the belief systems of the other side intimately for example perhaps their push for creationism in schools comes from deep rooted fear that their children will lose their religion admit it that has happened lot by being exposed too much to science in that case we must find common ground by addressing this concern it doesn help that the other side is largely unable to come half way in this process but they re hampered by their belief system that no excuse for us to be like them hold my side to higher standard not that think it holds water

the adult business reasons for you using industry standard tools are that you re too stupid to understand that those tools are just the ones that most of the incompetent idiots in the rest of the industry have decided to use there is generally speaking almost no technical justification for using those the justification is instead of the form these ebusiness enterprise class xml and ajax based database solutions which cleverly leverage your core competencies are more powerful scalable and easy to use than our competitors

dog blog news and info
and that supposed to reassure us
agree that you have point there but do feel that reddit finds good balance between enforced conformity and free for all opinion slugfest for example have noted that the feedback loop from comment ratings is not nearly as strong as that from face to face conversation recently got away with calling someone dumbass http reddit com info id xsh yef actually getting rated up for that go figure don think you re right when you say the rating system drives out the mainstream that would imply that in my conversations with my friends where theoretically there should be an even stronger feedback loop it would be difficult to discuss unorthodox ideas don find that the face to face feedback loop would indeed prevent me from sarcastically dismissing my friend idea of looking at paul graham blog but it wouldn prevent me from making joke about how much paul graham already have in my bloodstream think can come to conclusion eligottlieb post wasn rated down for its content but for not being clever or humorous witty comment lamenting the fixation this site has on paul graham would have done quite well in the ratings this is strike against your theory that the rating system drives out opposing views although still believe there is something to that idea

let decompose your reply it seems more efficient to reply to each sentence separately gt what kind of advantage do you feel clearly defined development processes bring to software business or to it department clearly defined development processes are an mba way of disguising hacking because he afraid of calling it hacking hacking has been talked about at length by intelligent people and you can tell whether the person talking about it understands it or not based on whether they call it hacking or development processes people who call it hacking are usually hackers themselves and therefore understand that hacking is usually solitary high concentration activity that involves peace quiet and few interruptions people who call it development processes usually haven the first clue about hacking and want to turn it into an assembly line process that they can control rather than an erratic creative process gt do you think it is advantageous for the parties involved to use the trial and error method to validate similar processes in similar businesses each on their own no think hackers should learn how to hack and then get hired because they re good hackers if you have good hackers in your company they will hack good code their own way and the end product will be vastly more useful and functional than if some mba tries to impose industry standard development processes on them gt how about training do you think it good use of software development company time to develop their own training material and courses no learning how to hack is not something you do on the job you learn how to hack on your own time because you love it and maybe you learn some new languages or tools on the job but if you re reasonably competent person you should be able to just learn those on the fly without using training material and courses

little bias is fine really understand that evangelising is an art and that programmers need their fair share of evangelisers but this note ruby must be their favorite language or they obviously don know it very well but just in case few acceptable runner up favorites are scheme lisp haskell ocaml python io and lua is either real poor attempt at humour or the type of bias which means that any dev shop worth its salt throws this idiot out of the interview room secondly evangelists should stick to evangelising one thing evangelising on all fronts just makes you look like flaming wiseass will they go on about how they really miss intellij and hate having to use emacs for all their ruby coding definitely not hired right so unless someone claims to the sky that ruby is the one programming language and emacs is the one editor you should definitely not hire them guessing what this entire recruitment manual boils down to is simply this hire me everyone else isn good enough pardon me while trash this advice in the garbage can

honestly it seems rather clear if you don approve of killing people don kill anyone fixed that for you the question at issue is inheritly moral and thus not clear at all my feeling is that abortion is not necessarily killing but whaddoiknow think even abortion opponents don feel that abortion is exactly equal to killing because if they did they would be justified in bombing clinics to save lives much as it would be justified to kill guards at concentration camp however very few anti abortionists support punative measures against abortionists so even they don act as though it exactly the same as murder still in the end the question is whether something horrible is happening or not so it not just matter of personal conscience it has to be decision of collective conscience that no it not murder so it is permissible not everyone decide for yourself if it murder or not
not really there are ton of problems associated with using the cpu and even more with using the disk presently you do google query you get result back in about ms right it takes me about ms just to ping google and am on an excellent internet connection in nyc they would have to somehow get ton of webpage index data to my pc then send me queries they cannot hold the local shard in memory because it would make my box useless for actual use therefore they would have to do disk read that would take big gob of time also they would lose maybe of their time budget just on communications overhead and they would have to make the shards lot smaller because my box is running lot of other stuff if they got the core engineering challenges knocked they would also have to worry about someone compromising the remote machines and causing them to return spurious results etc tremendous amount of engineering would have to go into that even if it were technically feasible google would then have to have copy of their binary out in the wild on my box it would be disassembled and analysed immediately so overall it would be pretty bad deal for them

is either real poor attempt at humour or the type of bias which means that any dev shop worth its salt throws this idiot out of the interview room no remember the article is about hiring ruby programmers he simply stating that most ruby programmers you ll encounter find that ruby is among their favorite programming languages and often favorite if ruby isn the candidate favorite programming language you re trying to hire ruby programmer then consider certain other languages which can fit into similar mindset and he lists them at this point if candidate says that their favorite programming language is java then maybe it time to consider different candidate there are plenty of good ruby programmers who are passionate about the language and you probably be better off with one of them if you re doing ruby project
there really isn an one size fits all development approach some software are better done by hacking in ruby while others are more suitable with structured team model there are many factors influencing which type fits which but the most important factor is probably how frequently the requirements change if you re building banking system where are the requirements are pretty much set in stone and most of the time you can build complete system in one go then you can have the luxury of year plan but if you are building web start up where you have no idea how your users will like your product it good idea to keep your options open and build your software in way that makes it easier to make changes later on because you ll be doing plenty of it

points words with specific technical meaning are often useful outside their specific technical context because there is no other word that says exactly the thing that is desired examples abound so regardless of whether this qualifies as exactly the same thing as normal arbitrage it is legit use of the term unless there is an extant word that means the same thing second your examples are beside the point he never said that he did all his projects in ruby nor that ruby is always win it has been apparently win in all of the cases that he has encountered but it need not be for him to engage in arbitrage if it is win in even one situation and the cost of having ruby as an option is then he can choose ruby for the projects for which it is well suited while avoiding it on the projects for which it is poorly suited note that this is isomorphic to the case in which vendor in market has an extra supplier that is not known by his competitors if sometimes has better price than the rest of the suppliers in the market then can engage in arbitrage by buying from when the price was better and from someone else when it was not assuming the cost of keeping on retainer is negligible this allows for strictly non negative advantage which is in fact arbitrage second and halfly if we re going to pick nits arbitrage does not require that you must always get strictly positive results it requires that you get strictly non negative ones it is exceedingly strange that someone who wants to pick nits missed that

know the rhetoric fought for know the operations conducted were in one way or another connected to the furtherance of stablility the establishment of power sharing democratic government of some sort the fixing of infrastructure and so on the realism of it now seems sadly laughable to me the rifts between different religious sects and different ethnic groups run deep to level that is stunning cannot imagine hope of any real cooperation or necessary democratic concession making without the most calm of settings now toss in the various militias every large group has don forget the neighborly influences of iran and syria among others oh yes they have big stake in how it works out too and how about the fundamentalist and other foreign insurgents who keep coming in pretty sure they haven all been hiding there for years so not sure what was really fighting for it looking like might have fought for civilian leadership notably one devoid of much military experience who idealized the shit out of their post invasion scenario and didn want to listen to dissenting opinions so little bitter
by the logic that the utility of wealth diminishes at higher levels playing the lottery becomes doubly stupid not only are your average returns negative but the utility of any positive return will be substantially less than the aggregate constant loss of utility from your payments insurance makes sense however for exactly the same reason since it prevents the sudden loss of great wealth and at lower levels of wealth that loss becomes devestating so in summary the article is bs but thought should clarify

not specifically focusing on startups but my comments do apply to those startups ve been part of programming the apps initially is trivial compared to the more demanding tasks coming up ahead when you start getting customers you need to integrate your app to your customer environment some customers are absolutely adamant in demanding that you must run save your data on the corporate standard oracle which doesn make sense to you but makes sense to them one of their reasons is that for general applications you can really use any reasonably sql compliant database and so it makes sense to have your app work on say derby oracle and db depending on the expected traffic taking your customer preferences into account without priori judgements will make your sales so much easier after you succeed you ll have situation where you ve given your word to support your customers you ll have new apps coming out and sales effort going to sell to both your old customers and new markets and at this lull you ll have spike of turnover and new hires this is what consider the most critical phase for success if you rein in your cowboys and consolidate on industry standard tools you ll have succesful software business because the game is all about getting your people to concentrate on doing the right things for your business as group instead of concentrating on locally optimizing their own jobs
gt people who call it development processes usually haven the first clue about hacking and want to turn it into an assembly line process that they can control rather than an erratic creative process for me software development was hobby when was hobbyist and then became business when became professional it business very much enjoy but still business in which the reality of results is more important than what would like to be true and how like to see myself as gt think hackers should learn how to hack and then get hired because they re good hackers learning how to hack is merely the very first step of professional development some people stop there but not all ve seen some people circumvent the step by doing other things and are still well able to contribute to the group effort gt if you re reasonably competent person you should be able to just learn those on the fly without using training material and courses quite number of people are say ten years from retirement and have been working on what are now considered legacy technologies for decades this process is ongoing and at some point you ll quite possibly notice that the technologies you ve been working on for the last decade are now considered legacy and then you ll be thankful that there is training available to speed your transition to new things or you ll be unemployed at fifty

thought the article was kind of good in the sense it got me to think about different perspectives but you re right the basic problems is that the utility of one dollar to poor person is much higher than it is to middle class person sure middle class person might blow on candy bar without much thought but poor person if they have common sense which is rare enough for people of all classes would not just buy that candy bar without some forethought if you shop carefully you can eat healthy meal for about dollars on average so playing the lottery is fine for middle class people because the utility of million dollars is quite large and the utility of one dollar is low but playing the lottery still doesn make sense for poor people

for those of you who are hearing the utility function argument for the first time let me provide the counter point of the billion dollars that get spent on lottery tickets every year comes from of the players just like pareto said it would and those are under educated low income minority men the article is absolutely correct in theory poor people might not be stupid to play the lottery in reality though the lottery is tax on poor people who aren good at simple arithmetic the idea that the lottery is good because so much of the money goes to education is also ridiculous you re asking the uneducated to fund our schools instead of the educated

providing the fire insurance example as counterpoint is little bit misleading since the utility curve generally shows that people experience more pain from the loss of than the pleasure they get from gain of this is not directly observable but can usually be inferred from people behaviour also this argument only makes sense if you assume that lottery ticket gives you the best odds on longshot gamble many other possibilities come to mind such as playing roulette or buying otm options for

will often play on the lottery when the payoff is large enough for the reasons that are cited here once did an analysis on the present value of the possible jackpot and found that it was good investment when the jackpot was about that was about years ago when ohio lottery pots were easier to hit now ll throw buck at it when it gets big enough not because it good or sound investment but because the reward total change of lifestyle far outweighs the risk buck which have no second thoughts about giving one of my kids for candy bar think one aspect of this whole scenario is that the poor don throw just buck at it it could be week or more now they are changing their lifestyle negatively on regular basis for very slim chance to change it positively
hey like answering questions like this of course it always great when people are curious about your field unless they re trying to get me to trip up this proving evolution is false anyway as for the answers there are many changes in dna such as in noncoding regions or in the rd position of codons that do not seem to have an effect on the fitness of the organism however more interesting answer to your questions would be that mootoo kimura came up with whole branch of evolutionary thinking called the neutral theory he postulates that the large majority of mutations confer neither an advantage nor disadvantage and that evolution is therefore the result of those mutations gradually becoming either fixed or lost from the population there are regions of the genome known as mutational hot spots that seem to undergo much more mutation than other regions the most interesting example that can think of is the gene which tends to mutate in response to uv radiation leading to cancer however have not heard of situations where this affected evolution generally when two distinct populations converge to have similar traits they use different genes to do it other than that transitions gt and gt are more likely to occur than other changes transversions simply because the structures of the nucleotides are more similar hope that answers your questions if you have any others or if this doesn make sense let me know
but the wireframe thing doesn really work because it will only find locally optimal solution not globally optimal one and the locally optimal solution that it finds may be suboptimal but if suboptimal solutions are permitted most np complete problems are solvable in polynomial time it not hard to come up with polynomial solution to tsp for example if it is acceptable to produce good locally optimal solution the difficulty of np complete problems arises precisely because these are problems for which local optimality is not sufficient guarantee of global optimality
work at college it fairly routine for parents to take care of everything for their children in lieu of the child doing anything for themselves roommate conflict mom and dad call me to say how this is impacting their precious child upset at the two year residence requirements parents call me then call my boss then call someone else etc until they get what the child wants the other day parent called from out of state asking questions about the college her daughter was student here but mom was taking care of finding out all the on campus housing options mom was calling from work the daughter was minute walk from my office during career development class for undecided freshman students were encouraged to talk with faculty member in an area they like to major student approached the instructor and said how am supposed to talk with the faculty person instructor said dunno maybe telephone the student instead had his mom call the faculty member to arrange it mom said hi my son is supposed to meet with you what times work for you puzzled the faculty member said you are calling on your son behalf to arrange an interview why not just have the son call this isn really the best way to take care of things mom said oh he standing right here but wanted me to call the point is that this type of dependency is brand new see students who are more sheltered more conservative more don rock the boat than ever more people who have no idea the nature of the world they live in and unforunately more students eat the heaping spoons of bullshit that comes from society than ever before some are demanding and plain fucking rude some look down on people in the janitorial and maintanance departments as below them they think that my job in my department is to meet their every need regardless of the policies and procedures if they come to me with an idea of how something could be changed their expectation is that will immediately make that change can wait until all these people have kids then things will be entertaining
no it really the same thing tsp comes in two forms one is the optimization form in which one asks for the path of minimum cost the other is the decision form which gives budget and asks whether there is path that comes in under budget and in fact the canonical version is the decision form which is the one you say you don like but the elmo problem has the same two versions the one described in the article is the decision form which asks if there is distribution of all segments but you can pose it as an optimization problem instead in which case you ask for the maximum number of segments that can be simultaneously packaged into thematically consistent videos then there always an optimal solution but contrary to your supposition that makes it more complex and messier

ll bite this is what think types of ratings there are number of ways that we could have users rank articles sort articles in order of preference score articles from to without first seeing the current score like on hotornot tagging articles to put them into different categories rating an article after seeing the community rating like reddit less flexible version of this would be site like dig also rating other users and using this rating to help determine the ratings of articles this is whole another category each of these has its benefits and some haven even been explored fully yet my argument is that biases aside types and even are the same similarities in rating systems when user rates the comments on reddit page for example he first gets feel for the vote density that this page has received for example if the highest scored comment has score then this sets the bar to compare the scores of the other comments to now as the user rates comments on the page he bases his vote or absence of vote on whether he thinks the comment current score is accurate he is no longer just voting up down or novote but participating with the community in choosing score within much larger range he is doing type voting with some extra bias from the community can readily be seen in action in that almost no one votes on every comment or every article that they come across pros cons of bias so now that we have demonstrated that the types of voting are quite similar what are the tradeoffs in allowing this bias in the system cons the initial voting on the article can be very influential as to whether those small number of people browsing your article ever even read it in the first place this is where these modifications to the new section will be helpful well that about it pros the system is actually helping the users by filtering out the bad articles if the article has very high score it also encourages the reader to go ahead and read it even if its outside of his usual areas of interest this is good for narrowly focused guy like me in comments there is big need for the user that doesn know everything to be able to distinguish informative or insightful comments from garbage without someone having to comment on everything it lets users just downmod flamebait articles without having to fan the flames by replying oh and while we re on this reddit guys please don ever add an extra funny rating to comments this is what has caused to go to total trash much of the time so gt why show points to anyone but the submitter we have the ability to block low scoring items that should be enough the same for comment scores see pro above for articles definitely see pros for comments heck even osnews has ratings on comments now who would ve thought gt or is reddit the present day coliseum guess that it we like to see em live or die in real time actually don like seeing many of the articles that die in the new section do so turned my threshold down to the other day just so could catc those articles that overeager submitters downrated just to make their submissions stand out am currently ramping up to building some applications sites who cornerstone is in effectively using new types of rating systems primarily and in new ways creating an effective interface actually seems to be large part of the problem understanding how people will use the system is the rest of the problem how does everyone else use reddit

nice article mjd enjoyed it speakng of expected value of the lottery remembered line from freakonomics good book check it out that just finished it went something like the reason people play the lottery is not to win per se since their chances of winning are extremely slim but to dream about being rich the proposition that one could win million allows that person to think about what they could do with all that money and that why one spends the dollar for ticket just as you can eat healthy meal for as ansible mentions you may not get the pleasure out of it as you would nice piece of candy sure the middle class can afford candy bar every day but remember something in my freshmen college econimics about the law of diminishing returns reasoning that to the poor person who doesn eat candy bar everyday out of financial inability would enjoy the candy much more than the relative wealthy thus goes much further for the poor person when not based on filling healthy meal but on emotional satisfaction

think what makes lottery tickets interesting is that the stupid arithmetic that keeps getting mentioned is really manifestation of part of prospect theory which won kahneman and tversky nobel prize the basic idea is that past some point events with small probability all get mentally lumped into rare category that has small probability but not small enough to be accurate so good event like winning the lottery gets too much weight because people can accurately process really remote probabilities you can use the same argument to justify insurance although for risk averse preferences you don need it without allowing this type of probability assessment inaccuracy its hard to explain lot of peoples behavior with their money not just lottery tickets

this is the kind of oomph the democratic party is going to need from its candidates even nay especially in districts where multi term republicans hold the the big advantages in money and incumbency it the kind of campaign that however hard the slog may just have chance of knocking the king off the hill and win or lose it the kind of campaign that keeps republican incumbent money in district instead of letting it wander off to defend weaker republican incumbents or to allow republicans to out spend democrats in contests for open seats

gt many schools just don fucking care about the students and why should they got to school to learn and make friends make friends with human beings and learn from schools don make friends with my school maybe my interactions with the student council and registrars office are cold but they are also efficient and believe me they get lot more complaints when things are inefficient
have no references but can offer you some reasoning in general physical processes always converge to local minima of potential energy because the system moves roughly in the direction of the force which is nothing but the gradient of potential energy thus nature is applying gradient descent optimization which can only converge to local minimum put another way at local minimum of potential there is no force therefore the system will remain in that state and not seek out the global optimum of course am speaking only of equilibrium and ignoring things like momentum which anyway must dissipate for the system to reach steady state that why your coffee stays in your cup local minimum of gravitational potential rather than climbing up and spilling out which would reduce its potential energy greatly and another thing dumb soap solution is not smarter than you or me how can it figure out the solution of the problem if we can
no because nobody ever said the utility function has to be continuous for many people vs is wash they ain using that dollar anyway so they don lose anything by spending it but million dollars means material change in their lifestyle their thinking is well ll be poor whether pay the lottery tax or not but if do have one in million chance of being rich the dollar amount doesn matter the poor rich dichotomy does of course this brings up whole bunch of other issues about people not being able to aggregate risk or see the value of building up small changes over lifetime however even factoring those in it could still be rational to play the lottery say that you start investing day at returns fairly typical stock market values after years you will have over million however you ll also be old what good is million after you ve wasted years of prime spending time earning it under that logic it makes sense to have small but positive chance at being millionaire by age rather than certain chance of being millionaire by age and for many people being millionaire is the only thing that matters

it is interesting to see that the article briefly addresses the subject of reviewer anonymity but this isn major problem as see it the larger problem with peer review is this highly successful researchers often get their work rubber stamped into top notch journals whereas relative unknowns whose work may be just as good or even better than the big fish get harshly criticised and rejected would propose double blind method of peer review the authors don know who the reviewers are although some of the time they can make good educated guesses and conversely the reviewers shouldn know who the authors are judge the work on its merit and not on the name in the last position on the first page this will likely never come to pass because the big names in the field don want to part with the name recognition that allows them an easier pass into high impact journals

thanks for the compliment but don think jimthome knucklehead and he absolutely right in that all np complete problems are precisely equivalent and so in way they are somehow just different restatements of the same problem all wanted to point out was that like programming languages while they may be just the same theoretically which is truly deep result practically and pedagogically they are quite amazingly different and regret my wording that seemed to imply he was incorrect

the problems are all isomorphic in certain complicated sense but that doesn mean they are all the same there certain sense in which circles squares and all other simple closed curves are isomorphic but this doesn mean that circles are the same as squares except in this one very specialized sense one could make an equally vapid argument that all numbers are the same because any two numbers are equivalent under some suitable linear transformations that would be an equally stupid position to take jimthome assertion to the contrary integer linear programming is not the same problem as travelling salesman in any meaningful or useful sense adopting point of view that glibly erases the essential and major differences between them looks very clever but it isn cleverness lies in understanding the real relationships that different problems have and the real differences between them not in adopting pose that erases those relationships and differences that what thought you were getting at by mentioning programming languages while there is an important and interesting sense in which all languages are the same the senses in which they aren the same are much more important and interesting both practically and theoretically think the only people who really believe otherwise are very clever people who have bent all their cleverness toward self delusion

since you asked downmodded it because it referred to the lottery versus meteorite argument but the article it was referring to did not make any lottery versus meteorite argument and because its comment on the lottery versus fire argument was obviously mistaken the comment says you cannot choose not to play against nature which completely misses the point that you can choose whether to play against the insurance company

who cares about goto they re leaving out named parameters http php net derick meeting notes html named parameters sigh
respectfully disagree you can choose not to play the lottery in which case you avoid the cost and lose the potential benefits if you choose not to purchase insurance you lose the benefits but you are still subject to the risk the article compares russian roulette with meteorites same flaw you can choose not to play russian roulette whereas it is hard to protect yourself from meteorites soldiers can desert but they are not forced to enlist either in most countries could have used other examples of high risk high payoff activities such as voluntarily testing experimental drugs for money my point is it rational to pay for fire insurance and not worry too much about meteorites because we have no choice but this doesn justify playing the lottery or russian roulette oh and yes my comments about wealth redistribution were deliberately provocative
lottery tickets are frequently part of government monopolies on gambling so that can reduce the other options for longshot gambles
you gotta be kidding
hehehe love the part about setting your friends hands on fire
what ever happened to clay shirky why no articles published since
the article does not compare russian roulette with meteorites it does not attempt to relate them it does not even mention them in the same paragraph your disagreement on this point respectful or not is irrelevant since it is not matter of opinion

yes that too they re all the same and they re all different beyond that feel it just matter of taste as to which side of the coin you find more interesting did have in mind originally what you mentioned in the second last paragraph but later decided didn want to be so combative since both sides are right somehow call me kerry don care
this makes me think alpha channel support is fixed for ie gt update fixed the regular expression used to detect msie to ignore ie or greater

that was what was thinking when voted third party back in now look on that as an impossibly naive decision though it is not coded into the constitution our system is inherently two party system if create new party today the effect of that party will be loss of votes for whichever of the main political parties is nearest to it as long as we have winner take all system two parties will naturally emerge as dominant the reason most european countries have nice range of parties is proportional voting unfortunately this is quite incompatible with the american idea of federalism it mess don think any tactical changes to the law will improve matters what we need is more engaged free thinking population which prefers to educate itself and vote on the basis of policies rather than closing its eyes and voting for its favorite political party or which candidate they would prefer to have beer with

have no references but can offer you some reasoning find your reasoning clear and compeling am still going to go off and look for proof or at least counter example the knucklehead who said that there was only one np complete problem can see the knuckle heads point it would be ok for topologist to say that squares and circles are equivalant in the same way its ok for complexity theorist to say theres only and np problems and were not sure they are different now anyone can see that the topologist is wrong unless he says in the context of their topology it is the same for arguments about problems he needs to say in the context of their complexity

okay it does have some reasonably good info on the differences between the formats but can believe there isn something better and more up to date out there for example as mentioned the patent on gif has expired so no legal problems there anymore also png support has greatly improved current ie does do full png alpha transparency albeit not out of the box you need to apply some filter through scripting or so which will be completely fixed in ie basically png is practically always good and most often the best solution also it doesn mention svg at all which is starting to become viable web image format as well

this article botches several key points would never be able to get million dollars but have dollar in my pocket hey investors can do math as well as you can if you have plan that truly has chance of payoff you ll be able to get an investor pool together that has million dollars particularly if you get to play the game repeatedly as many times as you like the spectre of crushing debt is just silly the value of the enterprise of playing the game would be exactly the expected net present value no more no less you should be able to sell that enterprise for just about what it is worth utility of dollar there is no such thing except for strange people who like george washington portrait on greenback the utility is for all possible other uses of that dollar including buying formula for the baby that candy bar or whatever all of these are sure things and they are all worth very close to dollar unless you can think of nothing else you buy other than lottery tickets the pleasure of fantasizing about the lottery is probably most of the payoff and the disappointment of not actually winning is probably underweighted people almost certainly get positive utility from crack use but would we really want our goverments to sell crack to support government activities are poor people perhaps not stupid to use crack he also very sloppy about the payoff for penny rounding one cent to zero utility is just silly insurance is just like the lottery this is misleading analogy can really avoid the risk of fire or flood or other loss that could affect my house don necessarily have the liquid reserves to replace my house if it burns down the fire insurance is weighing small predictable loss of utility against large unpredictable loss of utility the stupidity or non stupidity of poor people playing the lottery is not going to be clarified by haphazard logic

gt clearly defined development processes are an mba way of disguising hacking because he afraid of calling it hacking hacking is more difficult in team especially when you are working on an existing product it is awesome for developers but beyond that you need coordination to keep people from wasting each others time that is clearly defined development process and it is if anything designed to try and scale the positive benefits of hacking to groups large enough to handle the task gt no think hackers should learn how to hack and then get hired because they re good hackers if you have good hackers in your company they will hack good code their own way yeah really want to hear that my bank employs bunch of self trained hackers to churn out code their own way that advice again is great for small groups on fresh projects in specific problem domains if you are getting this from paul graham he even dileberately puts in caveats about these cases regardless in order to bring in new people on project they have to know the tools involved to not be burden self training is awesome at teaching you how to use the tools for what you want to do which is not problem provided the company you go to work for uses the same tools in exactly the same way gt you learn how to hack on your own time because you love it and maybe you learn some new languages or tools on the job but if you re reasonably competent person you should be able to just learn those on the fly without using training material and courses so company is supposed to just let you sit around and try to learn it how many people have you known that would not have that kind of motivation so far it has proved patently impossible to hire someone and know you can trust them to do all their learning on their own and know they have learned everything they need to what is wrong with providing resources to help learn yes have read all the books about the disadvantages of adding more programmers they are awesome books and make for really great quotes they also say that the concept should not be taken to extremes at the end of the day no matter how great everything else is you still have an amount of people amount of work equation the numbers involved are in how you handle the everything else

the differance is that after many billing cycles you can estimate about what these basic utilities will cost you instead lets look at phone service plans remember how happy you were the first time you got an unexpected bill for the month this is what will happen to many unsuspecting micropayers when all their fun adds up at the end of the month the differance is this isn paying for utilities or anything crucial they will just stop using it and never look back another comparison how many people use per minute cell phone plans very few either that or they are dead set on using it as one only using it on nights or weekends people will pay more just so they have the flexibility to not have to be watching the clock or in this case watching how many pages they click on not to mention that these services always end up costing more in the end don see how anyone can argue that micropayments as judgmentalist more accurately defines in his post will be effective for any online leisure activity

how about some mechanism whereby people who consistently vote stories down but very few up reach certain ratio of up vs down where down votes will detract kama points that should discourage the ones who vote other stories down only to try to lift their own upon high along with the sheer anti social ones

that not possible the absolute fundamental job of government is to protect its citizen from violence that means decision must be made as to whether fetuses are citizens or not if white people started killing black people we wouldn be allowed to say well that it might be murder or it might not depending on your definitions but we don want the government deciding we would have to say black people are citizens the violence must end alternatively the government can say they aren of course the analogy is obviously broken here because black people are obviously citizens whereas embryos may or may not be but to remain silent on the question is to abdicate the fundamental job of government to monopolize legitimate violence

an entertaining take on the million dollar homepage pixel for sale idea started by alex tew have to say the saterical blog is the highlight poking fun at current events and celebrity gossip the one about the mohammed cartoons is quite humurous without being offensive
it depends on the field but yes indeed it is used in many forums
ah context you sir have hit the nail on the flat rounded end
remind me never to have dinner at your place
suggesting that real programmers use algol means it was joke regardless of his intent
can we just stick with hypocrite
not bad take on the pixel for sale fad the blog is very funny especially the ones poking fun at current events see the mohammed cartoon one and the one referring to cheeney shooting inncident

the article does not have anything to say one way or the other about the stupidity or non stupidity of poor people playing the lottery it does not mention or allude to poor people everyone was happy to turn this article into whatever hobby horse they happened to want to ride regardless of its suitability for that purpose for example people who wanted to argue that lotteries are stupid read into it an argument that lotteries are not stupid and then argued that point with the article but the article has nothing to say on that subject from my point of view it is as if hundred strangers showed up in my email saying of all the arguments have ever heard that purport to prove that boiled galoshes are good for growing puppies yours is the stupidest and the suitability or non suitability of mangel wurzels for cultivation in the andes is not going to be clarified by this article haphazard logic fine but those are not defects in the article since it was not written with the intention of discussing galoshes or puppies or mangel wurzels and does not say anything about them the article has many defects but its failure to present cogent argument about mangel wurzels is not one of them and its failure to cogently address the issue of the stupidity or non stupidity of poor people playing the lottery is not one of its defects either since it does not address that subject and was never intended to the article was essentially in two parts one part discussed particular argument against lotteries an argument which focuses on the expected value to the exclusion of everything else and refuted this single argument refutation of fallacious argument against lotteries is not itself an argument in favor of lotteries and did not intend it as such the other part of the article was series of potentially interesting non sequiturs on the subject of risk the paragraph about catstrophic meteor strikes was of this type these non sequiturs were not intended to form any argument for or against any premise whatsoever that did not stop dozens of people from imagining that these non sequiturs formed part of whatever argument they happened to want to have at this time wrote the article thought it was by far the weakest one on my web site and seriously considered throwing it away am somewhat ashamed of having posted it but would be much more ashamed to be one of the many many people who invented some argument out of thin air attributed that argument to the article and then criticized the article for making or failing to effectively make the argument that they themselves invented
that article is just daring someone to try and take them down

no peer review as presently practiced by journals probably is though it only worked in the first place because people self censored their submissions and therefore the reviewers had small submission volume that they could scale to the submitters on the other hand probably could afford to self censor because they did not have as much publishing pressure as there is today now that lots of people send subpar papers to big journals there is little downside and huge potential upside to submitting subpar paper yourself properly done reddit like system could manage this though

find the comparison in the article between the file sharing networks and libraries interesting currently we are living in the country where we cannot have tv reception by any means we re house sitting so can install satellite etc so we ve been getting lot of dvd movies from the local library to watch it surprising they actually have many very recent titles am always struck wondering whether public libraries could ever be started in this day and age if they didn already exist from times gone by think not can you imagine the mpaa and riaa standing by while publicly funded institution allowed people to just check out movies and books without payment unthinkable the only reason it tolerated is because it an existing institution from before all this madness began small ray of sunshine from an earlier age of more reason perhaps am all in favor of the copyright holders getting paid for their work but is it worth squashing everybody else rights in the process maybe if they didn make quite so much money for movies then some of the actors wouldn be paid such insane salaries maybe million to star in movie is too much money to pay someone in any case remember how the mpaa tried to squash vcrs when they first appeared they ranted about how this would destroy their business since everybody would be pirating and copying away but look today video sales and rentals are their biggest earner wish they could have little more imagination about how to use the online potential rather than trying to put more and more limitations on us can even fast forward through the fbi warning on dvds any more so have small hope for what kinds of future draconian measures they will be putting in place if they have half chance they want to stop us from making more than one copy of song say enough is enough on the one hand they say you don own the song or the movie but rather merely license to play it under certain circumstances but then see movie poster trumpeting own it on dvd next monday hope all this reaches such point of absurdity that the courts have to step in and stop the madness because left to their own devices it sure thing that these corporations will bleed us dry of every nickel and dime

if rich family had kept at least couple of hundred dollars in the bank continually since the th century it would be worth an astronomical amount by now due to compound interest since there aren many old families with astronomical amounts in the bank it shows they must have spent every penny in the bank many times for example interest over years interest over years interest over years the average uk long term interest rate from was the us from was http www eh net hmit interest_rate if the american indian tribe that accepted goods worth guilders for the sale of manhattan in had invested the money in dutch bank at interest compounded annually their investment would today be worth over billion around us billion more than the assessed value of the real estate in all five boroughs of new york city http en wikipedia org wiki

ill cop to your demur and subtle criticism did read the article and its predecessors carefully but the headline didnt get as much scrutiny perhaps trust the ed sub red itors to much generally dislike ie mod down submissions that editorialise and or draw false conclusions from the submitted article reflecting on few of my recent submissions could have done lot better in this regard and hope to do better in future
in might not buy as much as it did in but it still buys you lot let us focus on the with the more realistic interest rate now divide it by reasonable number of descendants years later as pica mentioned above and none of this accounts for the upheavals of time over years modern banking is pretty stable but lot can still go wrong over years of changing laws and political boundaries the bank may misinvest your money and end up collapsing very common until recently insured bank accounts are of much more recent vintage if you don touch the bank account for while your descendants may forget about it and the bank may silently gobble it up http www cnn com law holocaust bank accounts it important to see where the money comes from rather than view the compounding as black box

as others have said think for most the main value is entertainment which is okay as to the utility or not think the article wasn convincing in that it rounded the value of cent down to nothing in the one cent for long shot at and by implication the cost of lottery ticket down to nothing the problem is even is not trivial amount and most of the people who play the lottery regularly spend lot more than and do it week after week at this point it really does cause financial harm and think the these people tend to believe their chances of winning meaning the return on investment is much higher than it is not even mentioning the folk who ve got system for those people think lottery essentially tax on the stupid also not to mention most lotto winners tend to end up not much happier after short period of time sadly no link available entertainment fine investment sucky as elsewhere noted there are other better high risk return investments out there did enjoy the what is my life worth thought experiment though
an impressive pile but with two caveats the maximising your returns story has been around as long as there been pizza hut the internet cucumber is the devil ck
the title of the submission is unfortunate but the language itself should be awesome if it lives up to its claims my main fear would be that when using intensive algebraic datatypes la ml happy mixture of tagged unions and tuples the type system comes in the way indeed such programming style really needs support from type checker that why lisp is bad at handling it ml sacrifices couple of important things most importantly function overloading to be able to do type inference rather than just type checking it guesses the types and checks their consistency it could be that qi type system requires too much type annotations and thus makes the program kludgy and verbose but it definitely worth torough checking

epistemic hedges aren noise though they carry information about the thoughts of the writer if however you are arguing that people should never hedge at all then would partially agree with you in that it would indeed be nice if people could always find the perfect word or expression at the right time but no one can do that it would be unrealistic to expect that

not sure if people self censored deliberately or if there was this work is mine only submit stuff proud of thing happening ve discussed this with faculty and the older ones have really strong less publications of better quality and the younger ones have everything that contributes to my even in small way is good mentality sure blatantly generalizing but at least in the earth sciences there has been huge decline in quality accompanied by huge increase in the number of journals of course there is corresponding request for papers for midlevel journals trend too because they need to keep those journals full journal publications are explicitly ranked by search committees for positions and by grant committees everyone knows what the first rank second rank and not so good journals are in field sure some great papers show up in the not so good journals the converse is even more true lot of same old same old conservative papers show up in the second rank journals agree with some of the earlier comments that there is old boys network phenomenon here though would argue that it is an old comfortable ideas phenomenon people want to be challenged bit not lot and they certainly don want papers out that cast their historic papers into questionable light and this will happen new research will make perfectly honest old research either irrelevant or invalid in new context so there is social bias against really revolutionary work think that science not science journals not editors of science journals not would be well served if everyone was told okay you can only submit two articles for peer review per year as first author and two more as anything other than first author before you scream that these numbers are too low remember that most of the famous scientists historically didn submit anywhere near this number and remember as well that spending ten hours on project perhaps shouldn result in being listed as an author even fifth and yes these rules are the rules apply to myself and have no shortage of research grants etc so obviously it wasn fatal decision to make spend fair amount of time doing peer reviews and doing grant selection work and can honestly say that of what see is not credit to those who did the work ve gotten harsher in recent months because the flow of sewage is increasing sigh

it always dangerous to extrapolate had those indians invested their guilders in dutch bank their money would have been wiped out there were ample opportunities for that to happen the years coincided with the height of the dutch tulipmania it is likely that the bank would have decided to invest in tulip bulbs instead of land or in trade with japan when the tulip market cratered the indians would have been out of luck during the second world war nazi germany occupied the netherlands and rigged the financial markets there to their advantage how long do you suppose that huge fortune owned by american indians sitting in dutch bank would have lasted

it not just course content that under assault from the politically correct the university of prince edward island actually confiscated student newspapers that printed the danish cartoons how can they pretend to teach students to debate discuss and defend freedom of expression even as they censor them
removed
after the student newspaper at the university of prince edward island in canada decided to publish the danish cartoons university president wade maclauchlan stepped in and announced that it was decided not to permit the distribution of the issue on campus in fact he thought the campus environment was better for halting publication of the cartoons the president of the student union which owns the campus paper fell in line with mealy mouthed statement guess it is fine line that we are looking at on very complex issue freedom of the press is not absolute there is also responsibility to balance it with justice to portray things properly

people who believe society purpose is to care for people are actually called socialists but dare not use that label in the us because previous round of demonisation equated them with communists who had in turn been associated with the cold war enemy century liberals were from what we now call libertarians but drew lessons from events like the russian revolution and the rise of totalitarianism in germany modern liberals hold that it is important to provide opportunities to the disadvantaged because if we don history teaches us the extremist groups will extremists are the enemies of liberty
it not even considered particularly left wing in europe but rather more centrist and as the inventors of fascism and communism guess we should know think lot of people outside the us view these us political labels with some bemusement like various factions vying for power in china for long time the us has had in essence single political philosophy capitalism think the republican and democrat parties are really just diversion to exaggerate the illusion of political choice it makes more sense to see them as competitors in runs things rather than things are run however have to say that it looks like bush may be radical who really wants to make difference

modern left liberalism is based on the faulty assumption that it is possible to give power to government without that power being abused even well meaning liberals in government support policies like minimum wage laws zoning laws work regulations victim disarmament welfare etc all of these policies while they look good at first glance are harmful to the very groups they try to help don doubt the heart of the modern liberal but every government intervention has negative effects that more than offset any positives minimum wage laws are effectively price controls for labor discouraging the formation of many temporary jobs that would provide valuable work experience to immigrants and other disadvantaged it is usually the poor who buy guns to protect themselves while the rich live in gated and guarded communities guns are used to prevent millions of crimes every year but such events are not very newsworthy since usually shot is never fired all saying is it not enough to be liberal it not enough to believe that you are doing good by supporting liberal policies you must research beyond the superficial and look at the long term effects of policies on everyone in society including the more subtle ones
just trying to illustrate how libs and cons view the world already gave two simplistic sides of the issue could argue either way not that would because it doesn help or maybe it is time to pick side and fight to the bitter end the cons seem anxious to grind the libs under their heels maybe this isn time for compromise then again just can get too excited about world controlled by either side so guess moderate http en wikipedia org wiki moderate or lib if the cons get too cocky or con if the libs whine too much there said it
modern right conservatism actually free market radicalism and not conservative at all is based on the faulty assumption that it is possible to leave corporations unregulated without them abusing their power it is also based on the blatantly paradoxical assumption that democracy consists in small goverment leaving most of the control in the hands of manifestly undemocratic institutions

yes am free market radicalist not conservative don believe the government should be in your bedroom either abuses of power in corporations unlike abuses of power in government are immediately and swiftly punished by the free market we are experiencing anarchism all the time it just political anarchism rather than market anarchism there is no god like completely impartial and incorruptible entity of government our government is it own watcher and overlooks it own abuses of power consider how far government has grown beyond the scope of the constitution as evidence of that you are making the mistake of assuming that government the biggest monopoly of all that makes its own laws will not be corrupted government is just people given power over others power that companies do not have and so government abuses power far more than any company does abuses of power by corporations always involves using the government against individuals or other companies corporations have no coercive power without government

if you want to see the results of free market radicalist polices in action take look at the british government response to the irish potato famine initially the government response was good the conservative minister robert peel provided free corn to the starving after he was replaced by the liberal john russell free market radical the corn handouts were stopped and million people starved irish produced corn and livestock continued to by exported thoughout the famine where it commanded higher prices than the destitute irish farmers could afford ireland eventually withdrew from the united kingdom largely because of this lack of support from london

both of these cases are primarily for the personal liberties and freedoms of individuals the freedom to be gay without being shunned the freedom to have an abortion performed secondarily can sort of see where you get the environmental control because this lack of freedom can only come in from environmental conditions but it kind of twisted to see search for liberty as helplessness against the environment

alternatively one could easily say that conservatives think they are responsible for everything they ve gotten in life and attribute none of it to luck they never realize that without the good fortune of being born into wealthy family or functional family or family at all for that matter or being missed by some horrible unpreventable disaster they be in just as bad of shape as the worst of us and they too would resent those who have had the good luck and insist on hoarding their fortunes while they tend to call themselves religious people they seem to have forgotten the phrase there but by the grace of god go

stronimo argues that the irish potato famine was exacerbated by the laissez faire policies of the british government he is correct the article you cite argues that the famine was caused by british meddling in ireland polity and economy that is also correct modulo fungal blight but certainly the conditions were there for disaster the point is that once the famine began it behooved the british to do everything possible to stop it they did not out of ideological reasons and the usual mix of arrogance and bigotry curious should the first world help the third world when people are starving or sit back and claim that big picture view would have prevented famine in the first place

gt modern left liberalism is based on the faulty assumption that it is possible to give power to government without that power being abused as opposed to the modern conservatives who believe the government should have very little power have you read newspaper in the last years
assuming the government is truly democratic for of and by the people it would have as much incentive to gain information and right wrongs as the people that government is corrupt and usually corrupted by the rich is not an argument against government per se but an argument in favour of greater democracy democratic accountability and participation in political life ultra libertal free market ideas sound way too much like theology to me believe in the market and all will be well twirling twirling towards freedom

your criticisms are by design disagree with the proposal because it doesn seem like it would make much of change anyway the election was really really close whether you go by population or the electoral college feel that we need system that will not provide us presidents that volunteer us for land wars in asia switching between the popular and the electoral college still leaves things too close for comfort if an identical proposal were made for nationwide approval voting http www approvalvoting com for the president then absolutely advocate popular vote for the presidential election hell you could even let montana amp wyoming keep their representation it might still leave us with presidents like gw but it the only fair change that drastic enough that it could change our political landscape

the reason microsoft pulled back on using net in the core of the os is because of memory simply put if the system runs out of memory managed code with automatic memory management goes absolutely haywire and crashes because it allocating memory all over the place without the source code knowledge without giving it an opportunity to handle out of memory conditions short of storm of exceptions this isn great but it usually okay for applications they can do much when the system is out of memory anyway and application code is notorously careless about checking allocation success but it totally unacceptable for the core os apparently microsoft originally thought they could deal with these issues but ultimately they discovered that they couldn anyway this article just big wad of speculative hot air bullshit

this will never ever happen the current system amplifies the power of voter in small state this is on purpose otherwise states like rhode island would never have joined the union so let say you live in wyoming are you going to give up your amplified voice if so your needs and views would never be noticed you be drowned out by california texas new york and when there presidential election they do all their campaigning in the major cities take the cities sides of all the issues and abandon everyone who lives outside of major metropolitan area if you tried what the editorial describes law would be passed forbidding it and for those that say this proposal would cure the problems that happened in the gore bush election think of this at least we just had to investigate the voting in florida with popular vote we be counting and recounting the votes in every county across the us every election

gt the problem that the proposal is trying to address is not really really close elections are possible oh that wasn what was trying to say saying that it not ok with me to have really really close election when one of the candidates just started war of aggression in asia switching between the electoral college and direct popular vote seems like rearranging deck chairs on the titanic we are deeply fucked in such way that don think such small change is worthwhile iduno maybe its more drastic change that realize maybe it be great since it might only be tiniest change in the outcomes while being huge change in campaign methods

this proposal does not rely upon wyoming or any other state approving of the method suggest that you read it again if you don understand this point law forbidding it would be blatantly and mean blatantly it would be struck down as soon as it was tried the constitution directly states that the manner in which state chooses its electors is up to the individual state legislature

completely agree with what you re saying although in my experience lot of the better artists are the more ambitious egocentric and driven ones however there popular belief that the big greedy labels are trying to squash file sharing while the poor musicians are starving on the sidelines saying nothing to do with me man friend of mine on label reliably reports that they get frequent requests from artists to do something about their tracks being given away for free on the internets and that the labels are therefore obliged to be seen to be doing something given that their job is to generate as much money as possible from the artists music the labels are happy to play the bad cop because they know that the artists stock will go down if they are seen to be throwing hissy fits at the thought of some kids getting their masterpieces for free

most old stuff that makes it to the main page is interesting to the majority of reddit readers and unlikely for you to come across through google because it not so well known and you wouldn be searching for it anyway come to reddit for constant supply of interesting links what the problem if it old if you haven seen it before and you find it interesting
this story illustrates why think the up down arrows on reddit should represent interesting and uninteresting instead of like and dislike don like the prank they pulled but still find it an interesting story
yeah that was enough to make me stop reading the article how can you trust the article at all if the reporter presents such an offensive bowel excavation as hook know know it odd that didn consider it worth my time to read the article but do consider it worth my time to complain about it

you miss the most important part of my first sql statement limit your statement will show one row for every address_book not only the first child address for each name record in my case don want duplicate names know you can by pass that limitation by using distinct and group by however if you are doing some custom querying reporting system one where you allow user to define their own column types it requires lot sql meta programming in that case it is more convenient to encapsulate each column with subselect instead of using distinct and group by in the end the second example is very common when you need to find the max or average or mean value of subset of records within the current table have run into that lot when building accounting system and hospital patient history analyzer it can ofcourse be achieved by adding more code but why would you want to do more coding when you can accomplish with one sql statement

when you find cool article don write three sentences about it in your blog and then submit the link to your blog if you think you have content on your site that others will like then submit it but don be blatant traffic whore
do comment suspected reposts as such before you mod it down this is as courtesy to both the submitter and other redditers this will help others figure out why good content may be rated so low and help them decide if it is worthy of reposting
relevant is the key though

know what the great compromise was and you are absolutely wrong that relates to the representation of different states not ruralists suburbanites and urbanites some states may be more urban than others but that has nothing to do with the reason for the great compromise or the electoral college the usa was created as coalition of states that would not have joined if they had to give up too much power

yeah that sucks that it got voted down it looks interesting bookmarking it for later reading think that the solution may lie with introducing slashdot style voting system informative insightful funny etc and then poor spam etc for negative votes and maybe an option to disagree with an article stance rather than declare it bad article maybe make it harder to vote things down so you have to go to the comments page or something so that people won open an article see that they re not interested in it and just mindlessly vote poor you can tell that haven thought this through but convinced that simply up down system isn going to cut it as reddit gains wider audience as the number of redditers rises articles like yours will come to appeal to smaller percentage of the community so it important to create some kind of method to deal with this
what is point of having programing subreddit then if people are really upset about the number of political articles then maybe the answer is politics subreddit
not noteworthy let the modding down of this comment begin
if they re subtle such as google ads on blogs usually scan them there no point deliberately avoiding text based ad which might be offering you something you re interested in especially if you re enjoying the content of the site and the ads are generated based on said content but when people put up floating flash ads on their shitty sites which barely work outside of ie that when start getting rage blackouts
just one thing don want funny modifier think that that what turns complex in depth content into big joke all too often on
don link to your own stuff self links are obnoxious
gt an extreme hypothetical an absurd one and even ignoring its absurdity it also totally wrong way wrong incredibly wrong in the election even if of california and new york votes went to single candidate he would somehow had to have garnered over forty percent of the voters in the other states the other states that he pledged to bankrupt so what are you going to suggest next that candidate can promise to bankrupt all states except california florida texas new york illinois ohio pennsylvania michigan new jersey and north carolina and if he wins of the vote in those states he would win the whole election is that what you want me to admit your big gotcha okay admit that if the election of the president of the united states was by popular vote and candidate promised to bankrupt all states except california florida texas new york illinois ohio pennsylvania michigan new jersey and north carolina in order to enrich the coffers of those states and he wins of the vote in those states then he would win the election you got me congratulations oh but by the way if we instead keep the electoral college add massachussets into that list of states and now he only has to win of each of those states instead of so yes concur you win the electoral college is the only thing keeping us from the tyranny of california florida texas new york illinois ohio pennsylvania michigan new jersey and north carolina unfortunately it makes it easier for us to fall under the tyranny of california florida texas new york illinois ohio pennsylvania michigan new jersey north carolina and massachussets
yeah email friend and make them do it seriously why does it matter if you re some unknown who else is going to link to your material assuming that we have minded set of users here and not bunch of people who vote stuff down when they re bored it sounds like good way to get known if you re good
yes greenspun does have the unique rhetorical style of referring to himself in the second person
whoever wrote the wikipedia article http en wikipedia org wiki reddit about reddit seemed to think that the lowercasedness was important whatever that worth
when you first try submitting something to reddit don submit links in minutes people hate that and will mod them all down to punish you which is unfortunate because if there good link among them and someone else tries to submit it later it will already be in the system and in point hole that will be impossible to climb out of actually this is something that the reddit developers could probably add feature to fix
in return wonder how much del icio us was helped by name that seemed cool our two mere speculations backed by zero evidence thus cancel out leaving us neutral on the question of whether the name helped or hurt

no must admit that didn see the tour de france because bicycle racing is boring for me you are right the behaviour of the com fans who were supporting ullrich was inexcusable they have attacked not only armstrong but another german jens voigt who dared to fight ullrich for his team and was insulted severely as traitor and judas by the same people should have known that there are always dumbheads in every country

sorry but don understand this the purpose of specialized subreddits is to specialize can see crossposting between reddits but can understand not putting something in the specific reddit created for that purpose as it is currently designed think your suggestion lacks merit now perhaps reddit should be modified like to see votes become sub reddit specific so link could be voted up in programming reddit com but down on reddit com then like to see all submissions get posted to reddit com finally like to see the language subreddits get replaced with language flag fr is not topic subreddit it language so disagree with your suggestion but agree there are some problems just think they should be fixed by reddit not worked around by the posters
never use postgresql if you are ruby developer otherwise you ll become lamr

there is none the programming reddit stemmed from this http request reddit com info id cdh conversation but notice who in the comments advocated the creation of this no actually this was mistake due to using the reddit system to vote for features know that everyone voted this link up because of the interesting comments not because they supported the creation of second class programming reddit agree what is the point of having programming reddit if we don also have politics sex advice and useless junk subreddits too would like nothing more than to see some of that junk hidden away this is difficult problem with possible solutions from tagging to different recommendation systems we ll find good way but the system as it stands is not finished edit think its great that you reddit guys are willing to experiment use feedback and even retract features that don go well keep it up
what who hasn heard of chung king teenagers
it matters in that read the whole article thinking why he on about afghanistan so much that so four years ago and then when got to the bottom saw and sure not going to re read it again in that context and if have known that it was something read four years ago and forgot wouldn have wasted my time
more generally behind every great writer of either sex there are lot of friends of both sexes
afaict the engine works like normal four stroke engine suck squish bang blow but it injects water into the combustion chamber after the exhaust stroke which boils as it contacts the piston and combustion chamber walls the resulting steam pressure forces the piston down in second power stroke the fifth stroke and the steam is ejected as the piston rises again the sixth stroke so overall it suck squish bang blow sizzle blow it seems like this could recover bit more energy the exhaust is cooler from the fuel and potentially lower nox emissions and reduce knock and ping for given fuel grade the downside of course is you need to carry tank of distilled water around guess the real trick would be to condense the water out of the exhaust stream and recycle it
think comments should freeze after certain amount of time like hours edit and mean that comment not all comments on the article
it was an experiment we didn create any more because not satisfied with the way it worked for programming we ll continue experimenting and eventually we ll find something that works well
this could rock now that star wars return to the age and setting of the old movies hopefully they can try to recreate the feeling of the old movies and not the comic gfx glossy embarresing kind of movies that is amp there is so many good series coming these days for example sopranos and lets hope that the show could have some of the same success and remember the clone wars animated series which came between and was really good

deleting all comments and replies beneath comment can be useful for example if you misunderstood something when you made comment and then got flameful corrective replies redditer have had good etiquette in nearly all of the deletions that ve seen but there is probably better way then again there always the edit button if there was some kind of notification for when parent comment to one of yours changes is deleted then we wouldn need this freezing
while it was well written the arguements were real weak last checked the war in afghanistan hasnt caused real revulsion throughout the arab world even in we had pretty broad support from most arab countries while will admit the population was against us at the time of invasion it wasnt rooted in our invasion of afghanistan but in just general anti americanism support of israel etc it has also been accepted that afghanistan was haven for terrorist organizations that were targetting america you can argue we were supporting them at one point but that would be like saying we cant attack britian if they lob nukes at us because we supported them in the war against germany so not only is this old its weak too
and anyway there is fine solution to the spelling nazi problem see etiquette rule http reddit com info id the most important rule of all take that you spelling nazi bam coulda wiped ya out just like that

well the zphone discussion http it slashdot org article pl sid on today was full of funny and politics thought would comment on what makes this program new and interesting by summarizing how the crypto system works guess overestimated the reddit crowd an advanced heck the only crypto filesystem that worth much and freekn fully automated gun torrent that you could build out of the parts in your closet zero across the board these are amazing articles by no means but just strugling for that tells you something would really be interested in seeing the number of ups downs on my submissions though are there any reasons this shouldn be done

going through someone comments submissions and rating them all down this has happend to me twice since this thread started have about for few hours and then all of sudden everything drops by point about an hour later it happed again that not nice think that the rating arrows should be taken away from user summary page if you want to do this to someone you should have to click each permalink
poor guy another one who should have read the game

there are comment deleted everywhere around here now its ing war zone haha here are some ways that this could be prevented allow people to optionaly reset the time and score on their comment when they edit it so they don have to be embarassed about making totally wrong but interesting comment just change the author to anonymous or deleted have link somewhere on the page for deleted threads deleted comments like the wonderful osnews system used to have for modded down comments prefer option should we put this to poll
see also my idea http reddit com info id sc on this
for one welcome our new warzone comment deleted strewn threads

if people accidently vote up hoax then vote up the retraction as well case in point http cocksanddolls blogspot com letter to editor html http villagevoice com news news html
guess people like there self links here you re sitting at as type this and agree self links are almost always crap if you write something good people will find it
imo you re probably complaining about articles that other people thought were poorly written or poorly reasoned and not actually just over their head but the point of reddit is that so long as you honestly vote up links that you like amp vote down links that you don like high quality links will bubble up among all interests no matter how sophisticated subject is if intelligent non experts can adjust in the first few paragraphs of your article then it usually poorly written
the cia didn change the book ending though did they it just that animated movie version
if there are no responses or all of the responses are also deleted then don think comment deleted should still appear

ve never been to cnn com either was just an example
who is wrong here people or the submitter this sounds almost like you are trying to ensure everyone gets chance to submit something interesting am against that kind of social engineering here think the best way to tackle this is to hide the user name for two hours as well
even in context it is ridiculous
im not so sure about this one we know this happened with steve yegges blog recently are we just posting link or trying to promote healthy discussion like this one by having individual links to articles each article can be modded on its own merits and discussed in its own right feel free to submit the index page as well but most people can just follow the home link on the specific page
agree with masterfuol it can be useful for submitter to just filter out the good stuff
just because they have title as cheerleader and do something bad doesn mean they all do it people just like to talk about cheerleaders

believe he saying that you are slimeball because you viaweb applied for software patent which was later granted and assigned to yahoo think software patents are evil but it wouldn stop me from applying for one just so that could hold it over the head of anyone who wanted to sue me

good idea and maybe also showing the top bottom comments by points accummulated
know you meant that sarcastically but in this case at least it was true that patents inspire innovation viaweb was not even in the search business and we only worked on these ideas in the hope that it would cause big search engine to buy us without patent there would have been no point if they liked our new technology they could have just copied it also while few people realize this the very act of writing patent application causes you to have lot of new ideas just as happpens with essays most of the ideas in that patent application only had while writing it of course arguably one could have the same ideas by writing the application and then not filing it but writing patent applications is so painful and people in startups so busy that in practice no one would ever do that

this can backfire fairly easily ve seen students respond by agreeing to hold up their end of the deal and not show up anymore if they truly believe that you won make fuss or report them missing then they will relish the fact that they are no longer required to be somewhere they never wanted to be this can lead also to other almost as obnoxious students ramping up their efforts in an attempt to get kicked out as well

dont agree with your dislike of the funny modifier on slashdot often get great laughs out of some of those posts although there are lot that are just infantile the slashdot karma system is highly developed having been worked on for something like im guessing years it is advanced enough for you meta modify the modifiers to your preference ie dont like funny meta mod the funny modifier down by two points ergo funny posts would become funny like interesting informative meta mod those modifers up one or two points
not true this only holds when the content involves something smart people do universally such as reason no matter how smart someone is if the content is of specialized enough nature it has the distinct possibility of going over someones head even if that person is very intelligent take the example of say high level math proof or an article on cosmology going over the head of say historian who may very well be intelligent
sketchup is nice for quick mockups but the level of detail they show in their examples and tutorials isn really practical with the tools they provide it decent tool for what it is but it not autocad by long stretch can model in lightwave lot faster and gave sketchup quite bit of learning time that said as free tool love to have it imho it not worth the they want for it

evil in almost every case software is already protected by copyright it rare unique for something to be both patentable and copyrightable the move from desktop to server based applications changes things bit though the value of an application to user depends on having access to the server not local copy of the application copyright only comes in to play if company actually steals code from someone or misuses it like making proprietary web app based on web py

it appears according to the linked articles that he intends to use it to buy startups this could be the new exit for small fast moving startups of the sort ycombinator funds with they probably won be paying tens of millions per company but might be happy working for year to build company and getting for it something makes me think ycombinator helped give him the idea would not be satisfied with that amount for reddit but think would for any of the other yc startups ve seen
absolutely everything can make it to the front page this would be determined simply by popularity the default reddit com would actually be what is now all reddit com with the exception of nsfw unless users opt in edit ok just saw ctsc post below mine we are in agreement on this

well let think about that claiming we only thought most of these ideas it not just single atomic idea because of the patent so for someone to think of them without that extra stimulus they have to be significantly smarter than us and we were not completely stupid plus they would have had to know good deal of the weird specific domain knowledge we had about commerce that narrows the field further in fact to our competitors most of whom we knew and knew weren very smart

or waited six months until there were more informed people and they had more time to think about it don think the issue is completely one sided but don think this is that great an example of how patents are helping innovation especially since in theory you could have sat on the idea and then the next person who thought of it wouldn be allowed to actually use it without paying you or waiting potentially twenty years this is something that might work well as trade secret too

although it has taken on other meanings linux is in simplest terms kernel http en wikipedia org wiki kernel_ some people consider that the modern linux distros such as redhat or debian should be refered to as being gnu linux rather than just linux due to their dependency on the gnu tool chain for development http en wikipedia org wiki and library http en wikipedia org wiki glibc support anyway the laptop requires such kernel to allow the various hardware components ie screen memory cpu keyboard power supply cranking thingamajig to interact this can be developed from scratch which may have potential commercial advantages for proprietary platforms alternatively project may leverage an existing body of work perhaps forgoing those potential commercial benefits in the interest of reducing the cost of delivering the platform various vendors have chosen to go this route in the instance of linux examples might include tivo boxes various wired wireless routers pda and cellphones those involved in the project have chosen to this route

actually the idea behind this is that they need to build up system to produce the things you mention themselves for this they need education for education they use these laptops
it like that onion headline about starving africans getting much needed bibles although think this is different the thing that africa lacks is infrastructure not money education is the fundamental way to get better infrastructure and cheap laptop is helluva way to jumpstart education assume these things wouldnt be parachuted over villages but set up in schools you teach the teachers how to use them and the kids learn from the teachers the amount of information available will increase exponentially really think there is big market in cheap pcs for america there are lot of poor people and lot of people who would like to surf the web if it didnt cost initial investment these people could use cheap pcs to catch up in america where using computer is quickly becoming part of everyday life think gates was full of shit you need to give people broadband with access to support guess he just signs blank checks becuase if he ever thought about developing countries he would know that those things are irrelevant mit is trying to support the lowest common denominator the people with nothing how do his claims even apply to the demographic that can afford anything

my article wasn really directed at reddit but here my point talking about capital constrained companies running on minor investoments or just founders capital though software companies are less expensive to run these days hardware software people etc are cheaper they are not free so most companies giving services away for free are losing money every month if they factor in opportunity cost of the founders they re losing even more money so at some point you either have to start charging money or the cash runs out or the founders no longer want or can afford to work with minimal or zero salaries you re right many companies are not playing the above game their game is to be able to hold out long enough and build up enough of user base and or ip to get acquired before the above inevitable event happens

prove just means to show irrefutably with certainty person agreement or disagreement with proof doesn affect the truth of falsity of the proof can you prove that when the proposed putative facts are in dispute that there can be no proof either way ll give you hint look up transcendental argument it kind of argument that examines the philosophical preconditions necessary for there to be an argument with logic and fact

going to backtrack little about not being satisfied we just haven found the right solution yet and there are couple of issues we need to resolve before continuing cross posting being one of them think we may just drop cross posting altogether just don like the notion of making users jump through too many hoops when submitting or finding links conversely we want the users to be able to find link they re interested in as well so there tricky balancing act there

there definite intersection betwween technical geeks and legal geeks probably thanks to the rise of interest among developers caused by the gpl eulas sco vs ibm and related software licensing issues for me this interest in the intersection of technology and the legal profession has expanded into other areas find myself fascinated not so much with the law more interested in those areas where the law breaks down the bugs in the legal system the bizzare corners where cases make you chuckle frown or just go what were these guys smoking suspect that there is segment of the reddit population that would be interested in these types of submissions the problem is that these types of submissions tend to fare poorly on the main reddit site there is apparently large segment of the reddit population that apparently thinks that if submission isn about lisp python startups politics or religion then it uninteresting so whether one of these submissions lives or dies is crap shoot it depends almost entirely on the initial reaction of the first person to see the link subreddit for these types of articles would remove some clutter from the main submission queue and allow articles on slightly less popular topic the law legal profession to exist where they are judged on their own merits and within their own realm instead of having to be subjected to the tyranny of the majority on the main reddit site
speaking as an agnostic with strongly atheistic tendencies who has been in many an argument with many theist here my friendly suggestion on how not to embarrass yourself if you want to get in an argument with someone like me know the basic claims of the religion that you claim to be believer in never cease to be amazed at the number of true believers in say christianity who have no idea what talking about when ask them their opinions on certain specific parts of the bible often they don even believe me that the bible contains such passages they conflict too heavily with the vapid god just this super nice guy version of christianity that is extremely popular today have had people actually come to my door unsolicited trying to convert me who have left shocked at some of the verses that pointed out to them that just unfathomable to me if actually believed that the bible was the word of the creator of the universe you could be damn sure that would know it word for word backwards and forwards in the words of george bernard shaw no man ever believes that the bible means what it says he is always convinced that it says what he means

honest mistake was also depending on reddit telling me that thanks for pointing this out
it seems that most of us agree that they should while not affecting scores
agreed at the time digg and reddit came out had just finished php program that allowed for voting on comments inside forum showing them and hiding them based on whether or not people gave them vote very familiar know thought it was so great so brilliant so patentable then someone else does it and was forced to realize once again that ideas are everywhere and to think that you are the only one having the idea is rediculous it was fun to be in that dream world of being innovative for while though what angry about is that someone can file patent then claim the idea so now have to pay to use an idea that came up with myself this is patent of an idea and how can anyone own an idea patents can stop innovation sometimes and other times they are just anti competitive

some students do not belong in any classroom that gear them for the sat and entrance into college no matter our society ensuring equal education to all under bill of human rights these students are like virus to the healthy operation of an education bent on prepping for college their behavior stems from deeper problems at home or with their peer group that require something other than educators who are equipped at prepping for the sat and skills required for competence in college this is especially evident when teaching students in inner city public schools where students routinely come from poverty stricken and broken families whose only education in self come from school itself schools are not geared to do what strong family and healthy community should provide schools are geared toward passing tests and acquiring mental tools for success at college when we require schools to do more than prep our kids for college and offer the resources to do so that is when the method this teacher employees will no longer be needed
totally agree decided to go for an ee degree so could learn complementing skills that would help me out later not to mention that it is much harder for me to learn anything about cs when seated in front of chalkboard instead of real computers all day have even met history and english majors that are excellent with cs think that its the desire itself to learn and accomplish not the desire to do all those things that make you successful in school which really matters
you don have children do you most parents tend to care about their young children and when another adult plays pointless mind games with them under the guise of education it doesn sit well ten year olds have insufficient skills to defend themselves against this type of treatment especially when it coming from trusted authority figure physical child abuse no mental abuse absolutely we can play semantics with the words child abuse all day but it doesn change the fact that child of that age should never be subjected to that type of treatment

you realize that for your proof to hold you have to first assume god exists god exists and was the source of info in the bible thus when something happens that is mentioned in the bible it is proof god exists sorry that circular logic
gt dont bother with the article ll sum up how not to embarrass yourself dont try to prove that god exists it will never work you re right but not for the reason you think first of all you generally cannot prove or disprove the existence of anything outside of the realm of abstract mathematics science doesn work on proof and disproof because the universe is just too messy to allow that however things can be strongly supported or contradicted by physical evidence so we can use this as weak definition of proof disproof but given this definition you still can prove or disprove that god exists because god by definition is an omnipotent supernatural entity not bound by the laws of the known universe and any proof or disproof of the existence of something must depend on those laws trying to use science to prove or disprove the existence of god is like trying to use the rules of monopoly to argue that you ve won game of scrabble it just ridiculous

what is wrong with trying to support nations ability to develop itself agree passing out laptops to starving disease ridden village would border on cruel but what about the people step above that they need help too the people working on this laptop are good at electronics they know computers programming hardware design all that stuff for them this is more efficient way to help large number of people even if those people need slightly less help than those at the extreme edges of poverty the people these laptops will go to help are capable of the bare necessities given tool to educate themselves and get in contact with wider world of information they will be able to better their lives how is that wrong or bad does escaping the easy list of poverty conditions suddenly eliminate your other needs no you don need to be able to educate yourself or figure out the best time to plant crops just take this care package so don have to see you on some late night tv commercial

gt again all in favor of helping people laptop is lofty goal though it will happen on its own if the market has time to work its magic in the interim why doesn negroponte go and donate to the gates foundation those dollars will go much longer way towards helping the poor people of the world tell me where can buy super cheap processors or gig hard drives market forces should have dropped the price on that kind of gear to around what one to two dollars unit the market will keep coming up with products that consumers want which for computers tends more towards bigger and faster than it does cheaper all that aside why is this wasteful the technological challenges involved will have to be solved at some point these are people from mit they are working on contributing to society through their specific skillset think laptop would be great way to further education handing out food and drugs is admirable but it only solves immediate needs and thus really only fixes half the problem education is practically the other half all by itself and that is what this laptop does would it be cruel to say sorry kid no food or meds today but here is shiny new laptop of course say in the long term it is equally cruel to say here kid have some food and meds can be bothered to help you learn how to get this stuff on your own

as mentioned in another comment one major problem with the laptop project is that it is structured in very economically unsavvy way better approach would be to offer an prize for cheap laptops why negroponte who is no dummy hasn done this is beyond me as for market forces look think you and probably both agree that there market for laptops people in poorer countries are just as much consumers as people in the states and europe if there were true demand even if this demand were light it would only be matter of time believe it happen in time trying to get bunch of academics in the lab and couple of hopeful visionaries in the corporate world to build the laptop s_ the crazy part

do you honstly believe that the internet would be where it is today market forces most econ students can tell you that the government plays unique and very important role in the economy we can verify this claim unfortunately but think it is reasonable to suggest that the internet would have happened with or without the government intervention it would have taken longer and it wouldn look the same as it does today but the need for instant connectivity is shared by far more than the military and some academics

if you see bill on the sidewalk clearly you shouldn pick it up because if it were real somebody else would ve picked it up already things get invented because people invent them mit has long culture of coming up with seemingly impossible academic ideas and then bringing them to market the principals involved are all tops of their fields what makes you think that the first team that wins the laptop prize would do better than them
gt if they wanted to play it safe they say that anyone who could be blackmailed for any reason shouldn get the clearance which is what they already did it looks like the new policy is considerably more susceptible to blackmailing gt if sexual behavior is strictly private consensual and discreet that could lessen security concerns according to the regulations that came as part of an update to clearance guidelines distributed in december now if you re gay employee and you ve kept it discreet someone can threaten you with indescretion this would be hopefully less damaging result that don ask don tell but it clearly along the same lines and don ask don tell has lead to considerably more blackmailing in the armed services than any previous policy about homosexuality

personally mod down any posts to reddit that are just lists of links to read the point of reddit is to tell me which of them is interesting duh in general don think etiquette should be about limitations on what one can post the community and moderation setup will deal with those that what they re there for perhaps the biggest argument against multiple links from single site is that it encourages patent like behavior with one user trying to put his stakes on new ground before anybody else would argue that this is not big problem since user karma doesn seem to be much used anyway in fact think there good case for doing away with karma altogether beyond the most neonascent stages of an online community development when they provide initial adopters with an extra form of positive feedback once you have good community this positive feedback should be unnecessary http com essay html seriously considered submitting reddit recursively to itself there would say in the first comment you want an index here it is the universal index now you need submit no more links to it but that would just be straight play for karma this argument belongs here where it is in context
gt also don forget that atheists don believe that the bible is divinely inspired since they don believe in god in the first place so any argument based on the assumption that the bible is the word of god is going to fall flat for example the bible contains many examples of prophecies that came true surely this means that it is of supernatural if not divine origin might become the lord of the rings predicts several events such as the death of boromir the reapparance of gandalf and aragorn ascension to the throne which later come true surely it must be of supernatural origin does this guy even know about the prophecies some fulfillments of prophecy are recorded in history like the kingdoms in the daniel prophecies then there the all the prophecies regarding the messiah
it clever quip but this isn strictly about invention this is about taking numerous commodity parts and putting them together in new way unfortunately no amount of wishful thinking from the laptop team will make the prices of the parts go down to the point where it is viable product they simply don have that sort of pricing power in the market not saying that it can be done not saying that it shouldn be done just saying that there are better approaches far more likely to yield positive results in the near to mid term
so it used to be that if you were gay and susceptible to blackmail you got denied but now it just if you re susceptible to blackmail how is that step in the wrong direction

not going to defend tjr but not all circular reasoning is invalid if say that whatever god says is true and that his word is my ultimate standard and then proceed to assess factual claims whether god my ultimate standard in fact exists then if appeal to some other standard outside of god ve just refuted myself because ve contradicted my commitment to god as an ultimate standard ve said yeah god is my ultimate standard except on the most important question for which have different standard that nonsense so the point is that if have precommitment to god as an ultimate standard and analagously for everyone ultimate standard don justify that standard based on something other than that standard that not invalid but it is circular in sense

quick clarification as been invited recently to join some of the new forums and want to make sure no one else professional life is tainted by what future employer might read here at least one person voiced that concern to me you are correct that did have less time to post on the forum and was increasingly critical of some of the flames perceived or resentful if you wish to view it that way also joel spolsky agreement that the forum had psychotic elements weighed on me as researched this matter upon hearing of the suicide however having discussed the matter with reasonable people such as marktaw one of the moderators it is clear that should certainly retract these claims as few people should not take down everyone and some people are so desperately in need of help that perhaps no forum could provide it

if saddam hated the and was training clandestine operatives in terror techniques why did his regime decline to form any collaborative relationship with al quaeda historically the most successful terrorists against the why does the ibd writer not acknowledge the lack of collaborative relationship why does he instead push that the commission found that there was relationship when that same commission found the relationship not to be collaborative
good small guide it doesn say anything on high level style though
from the report http www commission gov report report_ch htm gt the reports describe friendly contacts and indicate some common themes in both sides hatred of the united states but to date we have seen no evidence that these or the earlier contacts ever developed into collaborative operational relationship nor have we seen evidence indicating that iraq cooperated with al qaeda in developing or carrying out any attacks against the united states

starting the price ridiculously high and then haggling down to what you really expect to sell it for is just the typical seller way of maximizing profit you never really plan on selling it for that much and you re making tidy profit even if it gets haggled down by some huge percentage you risk sticker shocking people away for the reward of occasionally finding buyer who doesn care and or is just complete sucker and will pay the ridiculous starting price but even the buyer who haggles you down to price that gives you profit is sucker if they think they re getting some tremendous deal and hagglers often do think this it sounds like the author understands they re paying way too much but they still paid it and it sounds like they would have paid it even if they weren experimenting with haggling from the seller perspective it shouldn matter what may matter to them is if word of this gets out and they suddenly have to haggle like this with buyers who previously would ve settled on the initial price or at least wouldn have taken the haggling this far then you run the risk of losing sales if you don repeat this performance but you re not getting as much profit as you could have if your potential buyers didn have this information about what kind of pricing you re willing to agree to if pushed far enough

pedantics aside he got his point across that said was quite disappointed in this article to me the whole article seemed useless he singlehandedly tries to invent law of sorts but it simply doesn make sense all of the cases he listed are cases where abstractions failed because their underlying components failed don see how this relates to the concept of learning how to understand things at conceptually low level while working on them at conceptually high level cs student with heavy focus on operating system design quite aware of the concept of abstracting things to make life easier virtual memory caching network protocols filesystems don know like joel articles

ve never believed that math was not for programmers in fact the more program the more want to walk into my old high school and explain to the kids how important it is if you need to create graphs and charts programatically or develop games do projections calculate odds on and on you need some real math skills wish had done more than read the book and pass the test for discrete in college if only had absorbed little more some of my more recent tasks wouldn be so daunting
my contention exactly this story is similar with the added stipulation of managerial oversight down
ve actually never had manager base anything on lines of code producted so maybe they do get it
look at the raskin center website and you may be surprised they work on human interaction guidelines for over years now what they re proposing is something like next generation gui but with textual interaction they are strongly focused on not confusing user experience with interruptions like today guis wanted to say at first focused on what user focusing on then reread this article there certainly some point here
gt catch all errors that change the meaning of the text because ve aready read the book times know what it says yes but do you know what the meaning is or does the roman catholic church or the eastern orthodox church how about fred phelps http www godhatesfags com link probably nsfw everyone has their opinion of what it means and in the translation you change the words to have the meaning you ve opined quite possibly to the exclusion of other meanings getting back to your original argument this happens whether or not the scribe does it consciously in fact if what you said is true the bible translation profession seems like one way ticket to hell
example from the article knowing that the ternary operator returns true false value in this example you can make the code even more concise by embedding the ternary operation into the if then statement if speed gt speedlimit true false pullemover emphasis added
what are you getting at do you think this guy who has spent his whole life on this subject is just plainly wrong at one point or another there was just one copy and there was scribe copying it and the text had no spaces in it and the scribe may not have known all of the words in it and at that point the language it was in was current and there weren lots of christians around to refute what you write heck most of them can read what you wrote
shhhh was just writing in my blog about that
and everyone continues to mod me down just because said they shouldn interesting
yeah ve been professional programmer for many many years and the only times that ve ever seen anything about lines of code as metric it has been some programmer writing an article about what stupid measure it is and how managers are stupid for caring about it and stupid stupid stupid ve never actually been asked how many lines produce or anything remotely similar to that in fact don even have vague idea of how many lines produce ve come to the conclusion that all these articles are by people who ve never actually worked professionally as programmers and are projecting their imaginations of how horrible actual work must be into their absurd and uninformed articles
agree this is where the blogger lost me too perform long division with regularity sounds like he grew up in an age when calculators were commonplace saved my allowance money to get my first calculator when was about and it cost

only mildly curious about zen zazen mediation however people who are only curious about something are more likely to read the comments to find out whether the article is likely to interest them in fact that why read the first few comments before actually reading the article that said it does sound like you are vigorously disagreeing with the article and yet unwilling to say why which is very like trolling in any case the article seems to be saying that zen is the opposite of everything aim for in life so thought it was interesting and good pointer of what to avoid until ve done learned all the interesting things forever

the distinction between the pg philosophy and the signals philosophy as far as can tell is that pg suggests you add more features to your software whereas signals suggests that you implement as few features as possible and spend your time making the ones you have work really well the original google is good example of the second type mainly one feature done really well but we couldn think of any successful sites that won through constantly adding features
great wouldnt have replied if wasnt interested
ol pica been doing that for while it kinda funny
ah have it multiple submissions from the same user in short span of time should be folded out of the new page using link like other submissions by this user
think you should add as many features to your software as the problem requires but no matter whether an application is intrinsically simple or complex you should get version out as soon as possible
let me summarize that article so you don have to waste time reading it if the inner workings of an abstraction break in an unhandled way the abstraction can break joel calls this leaky call it life it very long winded set of observations that most people would make through common sense any and every part of process is prone to error the inner workings the abstraction layer everything creating water tight abstraction is impossible because it requires that either the inner workings be perfect and never generate an error or that the abstraction layer itself be perfect and be able to handle every conceivable situation and implicitly that the hardware implementing said workings and abstractions never make mistake there is no such thing as solid foundation not in hardware not in software not in physical existence the best we can do is build things that can handle what can be reasonably expected to occur to the extent that it even necessary cost effective or desirable to do so gt the law of leaky abstractions is dragging us down not really the universe our bodies computers the internet all still work reasonably well despite constant small and sometimes large failures

for me having mathematical maturity is worth the effort that reading and writing mathematics takes also think practicing engaging in formal logical arguments helps you with informal logic as well it keeps your bullshit detector in good working order in other words think like machine learning because it good blend of mathematical theory mostly nonlinear optimization probability statistics and linear algebra and beneficial practice you can get your hands dirty and write interesting code basic implementation of multilayer perceptron in matlab octave or some other numerical computing environment should only be lines or so and you get to see your software learning and getting better as it computes more it wonderful experience

as programmer love this stuff nice little gem
think lines of code is best used as an estimation of complexity this is the opposite of what the managers in the story meant estimation of productivity but it related to what you re talking about generally speaking more loc in program means it will be harder to understand harder to modify have greater chance of errors and have greater chance of cruft that last one depends on what the program is doing of course unfortunately the only practical application ve found for this idea is it makes me feel justified in sighing with dismay when have to look at one of my co workers gt loc projects for what we do nothing needs to be that long

gt now if we observe ants we can come to the conclusion that due to their brain size it is very unlikely that they can analyze our behaviour and see us in their complexity in fact they would see us as mere moving shadow before we crunch them while we have an extremely advanced brain there is no indication that this limit does not apply to us ever imagined five dimensional room we use mathematics as walking stick to peer into unimaginable things but the more abstract the whole thing grows the more problems we have computers are more and more prone to beat us in chess which clearly shows us our limits even if it is senseless brute force algorithm yeah btw dimensional room is imaginable gt this points out that it is very unlikely that we have reached the ultimate state of consciousness therefore it is very likely that there are things we cannot and will not understand duh gt all the comparisons with invisible pink unicorns and flying spaghetti monsters have one fault they are imaginable counterparts gt naturally that means that any kind of transcribing transcendental experiences to the normal world are doomed to fail there are no holy books or rules which have any sense at all so having an agnostic viewpoint which includes the possibility of thing being whatever going over our imagination called god has sense this is not supported by anything you said and even if it was it still wouldn make cinvincing argument for the existance of god saying that something is possible is completely useless gt telling that admit that my believe that means accept other positions than organized religion or strong atheism and know that is isn rationally proven is panentheistic guess not very thorough but your argument didn really have much substance assuming you that what you were trying to do which not quite sure about

primarily they went to syria not just simple matter to go in after them during the first gulf war saddam flew most of his modern aircraft into adjacent countries including iran who is otherwise mortal enemy to evade their capture and destruction the facts are that iraq documented huge caches of poison and biological agents after the first war and never did account for them as required in their surrender it was iraq obligation to account for these items not the us or un don know why people think that its easy to contain an enourmous desert border with hostiles on both sides when the usa can even slow down the rate of illegal border crossings along the us amp mexican borders don care much for the way this whole war has been handled but the above are not being denied by anyone with knowledge of the situation its remarkable that so many people have convinced themselves that saddam wasn that bad only to be shocked by revelations from his own documents
realize you made your comment in jest but still can help but observe that gt does not mean that gt foolish consistency implies little mind but the converse is not necessarily true
gt if you can prove it either way why do you care care what whether or not there is god don really whether other people believe in god don care about that either do care when people claim to provide scientific proof about the existence of god because that usually means they have an agenda that not going to like and it annoys me when people try to foist bad reasoning on others

you know the linked article does describe specific case where loc metric was applied to real working programmers so it evidently not all made up that said do get the impression that the heyday of the simple loc performance metric was long time ago was it ibm thing and that it is indeed bit of strawman by now nowadays apparently there are any number of nostrums for autogenerating productivity numbers for your project in general they re rather more complicated than just totting up lines of code though not sure they re really much more useful

knew that would happen but wasn kidding perhaps indentation sensitivity is better euphe hterm the idea isn to force you to use indentation instead of bracketing in all cases as python does but to eliminate the redundancy between the parens that do get indented out and the pretty printing so the code looks damn sight more attractive at least to those who aren hardened lispers and the danger of wrongly indented code is elminated it single point of truth thing while you can still do one line lambdas and so on it possible to bring it in without too much disruption or coercion too one could easily extend srfi http srfi schemers org srfi srfi html to allow an optional second header line to indicate non standard syntax then significant indentation source files can be automatically detected by their header and trivially transformed into an all parens form and vice versa even the layout of the source on the page wouldn be much affected by the transformation

more specifically here are some stuff love with qi the cristal clear syntax still directly lisp flavoured but lots of useless parentheses have disappeared lists as data syntax is also real improvement its functional flavour common lisp is just not functional enough to my taste scheme does better job at this most importantly it embraces the ml programming style in nutshell ml style is all about algebraic datatypes working not only with cartesian products aka structs lists but also sum types aka unions to do this properly you need proper sum types which means labelled ones there is tag safely indicating what kind of data is actually contained in an union proper deconstruction by pattern matching that safe and efficient way to access the content of sum type basically it means providing glorified switch construct which offers one case per possible tag in given sum type each case is associated with the corresponding code and in this code variables are bound to the actual content of the union moreover complex pattern matchings which test several possibly nested sum types at once with guard conditions etc are easily compiled into atomic switch style ones type system what really cool with ml is that you can shift lot of your problem complexity from the algorithm to the data structures that makes sense because the type system is way easier to debug partly thanks to type checking making sure you don unwillingly mix union tags from different union types and that pattern matchings are consistent and exhaustive that probably the main reason why lisp practically failed to embrace ml in ml type system is your friend and not psychorigid moron cleric as in many languages there is symmetry between product types and sum types and most problems which feel unelegant with products become natural with sums and reciprocally look at their symmetrical behaviors products gt product type gt gt foo struct int char gt gt product constructor gt gt foo gt gt product accessors gt gt foo foo unions gt union type gt gt foo union int char gt gt union constructors gt gt foo foo gt gt union accessor gt gt foo gt gt gt do something with int gt gt gt do something with char once you ve tasted both halves of the symmetry you really miss it when you re deprived from half of it lisp fan esp of its meta programming capacities yet often prefer to work with ml because given the tough exclusive choice prefer alg datatypes over macros now qi offers both and static type checking is made optionnal in it which means that you don have to bear it when it be of little help

well arguably there is law that the venom directed at syntax change is inversely proportional to the actual importance of the change in that case indentation sensitive code being completely trivial is utterly doomed the only thing is that it so trivial that it more like indentation style than new syntax and we know that indentation wars can happily continue for years with no casualties
feel so retarded now

just reading about math and not doing the exercises is fairly pointless about as useful as reading books about programming but never writing code agree that math in school focuses too much on the how and not enough on the why though still can remember the formula for solving quadratic equations you were supposed to memorize in school but perfectly capable of deriving it if would need it and the weird thing is it isn even very useful for solving quadratic equations by hand
feel more upset if it was some really banal danger show like fear factor the fact that it was supposed to be fundraiser for heart research ouch

headline leading with george bush screws up wake me when he doesn screw up
agree that it could just as anything be implemented in lisp actually qi is just the concrete proof that it could that the usual answer of the lisp community when you talk about such and such not or badly supported feature yeah but that could be done with couple of macros what matters is it could be done yet it isn frameworks of some importance are difficult and costly to implement such an important change as static analysis of parts of the program is huge paradygm shift it alters the whole development process and it not worth it for me nor anyone else to develop cheap knock off of it just adequate for single project need to achieve within real world constraints agree with lisp zealots that lisp has all it takes to re take over the programming world the problem is probably more of social one community which is perceived as arrogant from outside which brags lot about what it could do and eventualy does little if you except cool yet hardly usable proofs of concepts sure lisp have invented ruby on rails and could even have done it much better but what matters is that rubyists did and lispers didn and can believe the reason is not intrisic to lisp the language yet don think it just an unhappy coincidence either

no what saying is that the same pattern can be applied in any dynamically typed language as long as it strongly typed and allows user created types which schemers seem to construct on conses as previously described since tagged unions that can take any value are implicit in such languages what not necessarily natively there is the ability to restrict the type of the values that slot or variable can take in other words not saying that it could be done but that already doing what seems to be the exact same thing in vanilla cl and that it is statically checked to certain extent the difference will tend to lie of course in when the types will be checked

thought the article was pretty weak basically he generalizes from his own experience that he learned math better when he was motivated to math teaching sucks and you should all do it like did sample size of one isn that impressive which he should know with his newly developed statistics prowess think the most important point one of the ones agree with ha is that it is important to motivate students to learn something and to engage their intuition remember learning vector calculus and finding it difficult and then learning the physics that gave birth to the math and suddenly understanding it all okay sadly not all but much more perhaps it another bad generalization but think people learn much better when they can imagine what happening and apply their intuition rather than just pushing symbols around which is also interesting later in computer science what personally like about funky math is it seems to stretch my brain in whole new ways and end up coming out with better understanding of how the whole universe fits together and when you see concepts from different areas coming together linear algebra for multi variable calculus tensors of inertia looking like covariance matrices from statistics it pretty cool and yes can do long division on paper hell can take square root but geek who likes math and uses it daily in my programming work mainly stuff also lucky in that good at it and had number of good teachers so yes students should learn more linear algebra and statistics and yes it possible to learn math as you get older but no to most of the rest of the have solved the world math learning problems post
the article is kind of content free in the sense that there no mention of how the two guys calculate their btu counts for production heard about this guy on the radio and there was mention of him counting the petroleum used in manufacturing the tractors for the corn my unsubstantiated feeling is that these people are full of shit and they re making stuff up based on bs calculations
totally agree on the problem coding analogy to develop your intuition you need to go through the work sometimes after you have some intuition about things you can skip over more also agree the why should be taught much much more and for the record ve used the quadratic formula fair bit and yes could derive it but since understand it why waste the time find it quite useful if you re dealing with more abstract things that you can just factor or immediately plug in value
pointless you say you re telling potentially thousands of programmers who would go from learning no math to learning some math that it pointless just because they don do the exercises and proofs on paper without ever having tried this approach yourself you re going to completely discount the benefits of mathematical awareness increased capacity for problem identification increased ability to read and understand mathematical papers and infinitely improved chances of wanting to go do the exercises in the first place you sir are mathhole
kind of freaks me out really can you imagine new wave of lawsuits over what level of openness qualifies for the discount

actually don think there was ever just one copy my impression is that there bunch of religious writings that at some point were bundled together and called the bible although from the little ve read if you re just talking about the gospels ie the books by matthew mark luke and uh john then it seems there was one earlier original version
think you mean because there are other guys who spent the whole live but actually that doesn seem to be the case that much ve never heard someone say all of the ancient version we ve found are exactly the same
if you have reasonably high quality speakers or headphones you should check out the new high fidelity kbps audio stream on radio paradise on good equipment it significant step up in quality from kbps just about the best sounding audio available anywhere
why are you so upset for me personally and everyone ve studied math with just reading the books doesn get you very far if anywhere at all it isn until you actually do the exercises that you realise how things fit together and actually learn something think encouraging people in general to learn more math is great idea but don think they ll learn much if they just read and never use it especially with thornier stuff often thought had something pegged failed miserably at the exercises and then had to carefully pour over the text again to find out what ve missed but american textbooks are usually wordier than european ones so this might depend on what bokos you re reading you don have to do exercises to try your newfound knowledge of course you could code small opengl game to flex your linear algebra muscles or use statistics to analyse performance logs or anything else that seems fun just use it and apply it in some way

ok my personnal experience is that in ml build more complex data structures than in any other language and clearly the reason why confident in them are the soundness of the static type checker and to lesser extend the fact that you re encouraged not to use mutable variables or at least when you do you do it very explicitely and you know where and why and never have that level of confidence in language that don have such reliable framework but as always ymmv

this is better response because it starts with for me personally your first comment generalized irresponsibly for everyone in the world upset because the guy you re responding to says he was about to go repair his math skills and effectively you told him not to bother my article is targeted at the vast majority of programmers worldwide who including me until recently have never bothered to look at math resource again after they graduate it should be patently obvious that getting their noses into the books is an improvement over never looking at it if you bothered to read my article before commenting on it you have understood that absolutely advocating doing the exercises but only after gaining the insight into why you re going through all the effort otherwise most people will and do simply give up or perhaps you did read the article and now need to start advocating reading comprehension as well

what other hope does the us have at reducing our energy dependence can think of any they talk about fossil fuel used to produce ethanol but why can you use corn stalks or grass instead of fossil fuel then there would still net energy loss from total energy perspective but net energy gain from fossil fuel perspective say it the latter perspective that win win for the usa understand that there are whole towns in the midwest that are now revitalized because they have an ethanol distillery pumping up the economy that jobs and dollars that stay in the us the japanese beat us with hybrid cars but it sounds like ford and gm are winning in the ethanol race three cheers for ethanol
silly silly article
no it not solved by the score hiding and yes that my blog the lack of positive scores on those articles doesn concern me because of the flaw discuss here in the reddit scoring system suppose people like the article and dislike that would provide here but on site without negative votes such as shoutwire it would show is much less than random example and given reader should logically be as likely to read the as the but it is more meaningful than the which doesn show that there are number of people who think the article is useful pinkfu so don go there give crap
sure but it seems lot more reasonable to expect the lisp guru sitting in front of his customised emacs to make it insert the superfluous parens he is used to than it is to tell the guy who is poking at some lisp in notepad that it would be lot more readable if he just installed and learned special editor that would make the superfluous parens disappear after all the whole point of plain text file format is to make your data usable to humans with basic non specialised tools yes also the redundancy between pretty printing and superfluous parens represents duplicated data which is something to avoid in your underlying data format these things do matter fair bit if you want lisp to win big relatively small speed bumps at the start of learning process have crazily effect in driving potential learners away
the real trick is the flex fuel sensor http www siemensvdo com powertrain sensors powertrain flex fuel sensor that tells the software how much ethanol is present

how is it different from any other religion seriously religions that are thousands of years old and that have quite literally molded the society that we live in today confluence of religions have incredible importance even if the foundations are completely fictitious from that perspective it doesn matter if jesus was god son or mohammad was prophet the result is that the world we live in today is enormously influenced by it thousands of years ago man wanted answers and lacking scientific means arguably they sometimes resorted to inventing explanations creating god in man image and everyone was happy if on the other hand in the modern era with all we ve learned and know science fiction writer not err talking about any religion in particular imagines up pretty far fetched story remarkably correlating with his line of fiction then it should be debunked and discarded showing disdain for something with such lack of history and lack of any credibility at all is completely healthy response lumping the latter in the former is ridiculous

haven made any in depth research here but the main difference between scientology and all other major religions seemes to be the lack of moral and ethical teachings see the ethics trap http www xenu net roland intro html it completely self centered religion quest to free yourself from some kind of spirits inside your body could be wrong though you might argue that it resembles buddhism where the ultimate goal is to achieve nirvana but buddhism also teaches respect for others peace and understanding etc edit on second thought after reading wikipedia http en wikipedia org wiki xenu can say can view scientology as religion man this ron guy must ve been on acid trip when he came up with this shit gt the galactic confederacy civilization was comparable to our own with people walking around in clothes which looked very remarkably like the clothes they wear this very minute and using cars trains and boats looking exactly the same as those circa on earth gt the space planes were exact copies of douglas dc except the dc had fans propellers on it and the space plane didn why ca and why dc planes with wings in space beacause thats when ron came up with this crap the guy obviously couldn foresay futuristic cars and technology screw tolerance anybody claiming to be scientologist is stupid stupid person with reasoning like year old

about the redesign http en wikipedia org wiki wikipedia_talk main_page the proposed main page design improves the prominence of the portal links clearly divides the header article navigation links and project related links includes both the picture of the day and did you know on the main page seven days week adds section containing descriptions of wikipedia important non article areas swaps the positions of did you know and selected anniversaries renamed on this day thereby establishing left hand column that highlights our most polished articles and our newest articles which hopefully will receive similar treatment along with right hand column that highlights current news stories and news stories from years past swaps the positions of the links to our sister projects and the links to other languages wikipedias thereby eliminating the need to use extra small text for the latter aims to improve the page aesthetic appearance this was previously submitted http reddit com info id vj to reddit by hitsman again when it was up for voting

we need reddit feature which allows you to vote down everything someone has ever posted with one button more seriously negative karma wouldn go amiss not that this would stop trolls but everyone would have giggle at each new low his karma reaches and know to disregard him on sight
temporarily suspending users from submitting links not commenting for certain amount of time for continuously posting links to their own blog or spam sites would perhaps help discourage people from doing that kind of thing this could be detected by taking the percentage of negative votes that their links get voted after certain number also detecting that the user is continually submitting articles from the same place that all get voted down could also help determine users like this this would actually penalize someone eventually for posting lots of bad links people like this http reddit com user naphets and this http reddit com user anatolyl would not get away with trying to get traffic to their site by spamming reddit this would also allow reddit users some group control over spammers

zak what kind of language syntax libraries simple system would you prefer to get started in general and specifically for graphics related programming
as long as the base language features are finalized and he is willing to take on dictatorship role agree what don want to see is people haphazardly adding features to the core language that belong in libraries or half dozen slighly incompatible implementations common lisp has both of these problems and think they re big part of its lack of popularity
impressed that the german newsagent in question was so helpful in providing change especially for non existent denominations gt cologne newsagent bernd friedhelm accepted one of the fake euro notes from an unknown customer who bought two cartons of cigarettes and walked off with euros in change
not entirely sure but know what it not and it not this don have any experience with graphics related programming but here are some things that come to mind the syntax should be simple things like ml scheme and tcl come to mind java does not generic programming object system would probably be preferable to message passing unsure about static vs dynamic typing in this domain generally prefer dynamic typing but can see where an ml style type system might be good here in any case have strong bias against exposing beginners to the explicit type declarations used in this language

actually took pinker class last year in my opinion he stuck on proof of concept that language really does affect thinking which has led him into some dead ends he getting old enough that this kind of thing is inevitable ever read kuhn structure of scientific revolutions wrote paper for the class which addresses this thread directly only with some contemporary neuro research behind it pinker believes in modular theory of mind which means that he thinks that our brains are set of coevolved functional units modules each of which behave very differently on the basis of evolutionary development sight is module as is hearing language face recognition dexterity etc this theory is good in that it further opens the black box of the unconscious mind but modular mind theories are ultimately limited in that the highest level of granularity of structure within the brain that they can address is module better model would actually look at the patterns of neural association in the brain or within these modules pinker doesn seem to care about this kind of research even though it tends to explain many more of the subtleties of our psychology than his such as priming now referred to by psychologists as an general effect all this modularity business confounds our understanding of what is actually happening within the mind in leads philosophers of mind who do not even read the neuro research to say ridiculous things like language is the module which unifies all other modules that great but how on earth do you support such claim if it not by looking at the structure of relationships behind our thinking the paper is pretty short but it has good references if you re interested you can read it at http people fas harvard edu garris garrison thought pdf most of the non book refs can be found easily on google scholar

oh shut up
you wanted legitimate argument for thing being etc which can be called god not proof my argument says nothing more than that such thing could really exist so people who believe in such thing being could not be dismissed as superstitous and irrational per se you are right that it is not convincing for converting people but you haven said that this condition must be fulfilled you said that saying something is possible is completely useless according to your argument the seti program search for extraterristial intelligence is completely useless because there is currently no indication that such life exists to prove it we need to test planets for oxygen or listen for em transmissions you may say that the difference between god and seti is that the latter can be proven but there are reasons that et may very well exist even if it is entirely impossible to prove it first transgalactic distances may prevent spectral analysis of other planets forever second suspicious long range transmissions which are detectable are energy hungry and so just century after broadcasting the advance in technology with satellites mobile phones cable transmission with glass fibers etc causes that even our long range transmissions are dying out
gt if america was changing stuff like this people would be complaining about america invading countries and destroying their cultures and you see the result of them not changing it the problem it seems is that the end result of america invading countries and changing their cultures seems to be very difficult to distinguish from the end result of us not invading them and changing their cultures btw did support the toppling of the taliban for the simple reason that they unlike saddam hussein attacked us but now it looks like we ve gone to all of the trouble with the associated cost and loss of life of taking out tyrannical fundamentalist regime in order to replace it with democratically elected tyrannical fundamentalist regime great job team can wait to see how iraq turns out most people who really think about it and all too many on both sides of the political spectrum do not realize that the line between supporting freedom and interfering in other cultures is very difficult to define but if we re invading countries and knocking down governments in the name of freedom it doesn look too good when the result is stuff like this

registered just to post this comment but look forward to posting more every good muslim practices jihad jihad means to refrain from actions that corrupt the mind body and soul as listed by islamic tenets murder theft fornication adultery backbitting greed envy jealousy usury etc it is struggle against the gluttony of the flesh and the material world this is the jihad every muslim is encouraged to practice the lesser form of jihad is the holy war holy war as described under islam tenets is fight in defence of muslim life family property fellow muslim if they are being wrongfully persecuted and the religion of islam there are two key important points that need to be emphasized in the last paragraph the first is that the fight does necessarily have to be physical or voilent the second is that the fight has to be defensive and offensive in other words muslim should never be the aggressor if unfortunately the conflict cannot be resolved peacefully there are islamic rules of engagement that should be followed any action outside the rules are considered barbaric criminal and unislamic ll list the ones remember women and children as well as ill infirm and old people should not be attacked plants and lower animals should not be harmed innocent entities who have nothing to do with the conflict should neither be attacked or harmed if the opposing party throws in the towel the fight should cease immediately in conclusion jihad does not mean terrorism and jihadists assume this means muslims who practice jihad are not terrorists islam forbids terrorism and good muslims are disgusted by acts of terrorism the term islamist jihadist as abused by the authors of this article is an oxymoron

well if you re thinking of the class helloworld public static void main string args system out println hello world kind of tedium dare say you haven had good look at real processing code ellipse is complete processing program that will compile and display circle on the screen for animation http processing org learning examples setupdraw html you just define setup function and draw function tedium hello instead of knee jerk it like java ergo it sucks reaction please pick up some real processing code and point out what exactly is wrong with it would so terrify beginners then we can have more constructive discussion
it was just wierd really don think most people are wired to think functional it was easier to see how series of steps happened in an imperative language at least as beginner really wan that interested in programming before university miranda believe is the predecessor for haskell we did some non trivial stuff in it will grant that but it was terrifying they tried to make it fun and everyone was friendly and helpful but it was just bit to magical it put me off functional languages for long time this is going back years think it was well meaning no one wanted to scare people appreciate it now and am now working back through what has happened with functional languages in the meantime would think something like ruby could be an ideal candidate as long as people didn go overboard with meta programming etc ruby feels mainstream enough it can be imperative or functional etc man am sounding like fan now am not really barely use ruby still mostly java and don mind it too much most of the time but don build web apps

yeah every language has its wierd top level quirks like for stdout in lisp hehehe think its fair enough to ask people to go beyond that can remember the last time did public static blah blah in java someone who complains about it clearly has not had to do much with it its strawman in the java and net world there is view that the language is really the language plus the tools ides as they are not exactly usable on their own am not saying that is right but thats the viewpoint out there but having good command line like irb would think would be ideal show how people can build things from the bottom up as pg likes to say quite like irb actually it seems uber friendly perhaps lisp in box need to pick something to teach my daughter as she gets older

gt sorry didn see it here before you re right apologize for sounding snotty things show up here so fast it easy to miss them sometimes gt what if people are driving anyway as an addition to current conditions wouldn capturing energy that is already being produced and wasted and converting it to electricity be positive it would but this won do that instead it will increase the amount of work cars have to do by making them climb over slight bump and consequently the amount of gas that they burn that where the energy to generate electricity will come from there is great deal of energy wasted by modern cars engine exhaust heat braking etc and someone might come up with ways to capture some of that and use it not all of course thanks to the nd law of thermo but some in fact some schemes like this have been explored and or developed for example there is regenerative braking in electric cars which slows the car by turning the motor into generator capturing some of the kinetic energy and converting it back into electrical charge there is also the interesting story of the six stroke engine http reddit com goto id that according to its inventor recaptures some of the waste heat produced and does useful work with it these technologies of course only focusing on recapturing waste energy to power the individual vehicle but if adopted on large enough scale they would have significant effect on nation energy infrastructure but the idea of the electricity generating speedbumps is just silly sure the inventor is proud of himself but hope that somebody with some basic physics sense is involved in the decision of whether or not to adopt it
actually that isn quite true the are more than few things that might work here back in the maybe more recently not sure ethanol and methanol were used as anti freeze they can be used in temperatures down to the real problem for use as radiator antifreeze is that they evaporate easily so you have to check the radiator often to make sure they have all evaporated which would let the water freeze if you re using them in six stroke that isn an issue since you expect the level to decrease fairly quickly the problem then is that the ethanol might burn which isn quite what you re intending it to be used for that being said had heard of few subaru performance enthusiasts who were putting in water injection system that would inject water into the cylinder when the fuel went in they reported improved power and decreased knock or rather that they could increase turbo pressure without getting knocking it also was reported to improve emissions ve also seen some sites mostly for motorcycle racing where water injection seems to be given that suggested that adding ethanol it has different properties than gasoline to the water improved performance gallon even further with the benefit of acting as antifreeze as well

these ideas are discussed in great detail in david landes book the wealth and poverty of nations why some are so rich and some so poor http www amazon com gp product ref fencoding utf amp glance amp there are three major reasons for wealth poverty geography infrastructure and culture economists disregard culture as economic artefact because it can be quantified and its politically incorrect the reason economists distrust culture is because it is such one size fits all argument nations are developed not because they are more intelligent but they work better as society meaning the co operate better in the macroeconomic sense not corrupt socially responsible etc its cultural traits and values rather than resources are what make or break country

can help but think that this article was reddited because we are supposed to be impressed by the oppressive and controlling nature of the chinese government though if you read the article the decision was made for orthographical reasons as has been amply pointed out in these comments china is not the only country that does this in fact live in country norway with an official list of names and our child name is not on that list we get lot of raised eyebrows and is that name from people we meet for the first time it actually not on anyone list we named him after programming language so my point is even if china decision in this matter were oppressive and weirdly controlling many other nations do this too and so do many individuals

the problem you are trying to point out is that people don understand or don know how to implement being assertive being assertive just means asking for what you need and not taking crap if you do it wrong you come off as an asshole and if you don do it you come off as too shy it all about knowing what you want and taking the right steps to get it in the cases guy is talking about the people you are sucking up to have power over something that you want but they do not have vested interest in screwing you over until you give them reason sucking up to car dealer or salesman is probably not going to get you anything but brightening the day of somebody who is performing service for you can really help

then why do conservative economic policies tend to help the rich while giving the shaft to the poor just assumed it was because rich people are the ones supporting conservative governments you re right that over generalizing but this article is pretty general and was trying to come up with an explanation for their findings can only generalize from the rich people know who tend to be economically conservative they want to keep their wealth and also tend to give their children everything they ask for

in my view his article is just plain wrong it easy to blame the victim and it certainly attractive after all if the poverty of poor countries is their own fault then we certainly shouldn bother trying to help them right okay corruption stunts economic growth but it very poor predictor of poverty because some of the least corrupt countries in africa are extremely poor and some of the most corrupt countries elsewhere are developing quickly it more likely that corruption is caused by poverty underpaid public servants have an added incentive to take bribes and an undereducated public does poor job of monitoring officials to keep them accountable countries are poor for many reasons they may lack natural resources or infrastructure or fertile cropland or natural seaports and many of them were systematically robbed of their resources for centuries under european colonialism to blame the problem on kleptocracy is dangerous fallacy for an excellent opposing view read jeffrey sach book the end of poverty

gt but it very poor predictor of poverty because some of the least corrupt countries in africa are extremely poor you will have to give examples know that botswana is doing well and it has relatively low level of corruption gt and some of the most corrupt countries elsewhere are developing quickly read somewhere that corruption in east asian countries is different than elsewhere because the corrupt governments tend to spend some of their ill gotten gains on infrastructure

not unless he press the charges nowadays patent system is so ridiculous that many companies register patents just to prevent themselves to be dragged to the court by patent squatters
don believe the article said it is the only reason it just explored one of the many it likely that poverty and corruption reinforce each other as the country deteriorates in downward spiral once people lose faith in the society and are disconnected from it it might be unfixable unless big shakeup occurs the most ridiculous part that the author touches on is that the rich in poor country would be even richer if they share little of the wealth think poor countries should receive more aid but if and only if they remove the self defeating beauracracy that makes it impossible to do business

gt with more people chasing the same jobs wages and secondary labor conditions must go down that the whole point larger population inevitably leads to net job growth it simply naive to think of the job pool as static resource and therefore needing to be protected from new entrants you might just as well propose sterilisation as stopping immigration the fact that nobody does this just goes to show that the real motivation here is xenophobia dressed up as an economic argument and the logical conclusion of this position is that declining population is good for the economy which is clearly nonsensical gt employers really like this situation for them there can be enough immigration you know that employer and employee are in perpetual state of conflict right that just typical recruiting propaganda that politicians use to attract people in marginal situations nominally left wing parties say this kind of thing as well as the far right because they are simply telling people what they want to hear don forget that larger population also means more employers you might also want to consider that an employer who wants to really drive down labour costs doesn need immigration to achieve this as they can always outsource you think it better for the danish economy to have those jobs go abroad or stay at home gt apart from that many polish work here to sustain their family in poland so call crap on the fueling the dutch economy thing as well so you think that the set of workers who are polish export more money to poland than they spend in denmark obviously only tiny proportion of earnings leaves denmark and there is net boost to the danish economy

the sachs book mentioned above goes into lot of depth about this but for one example take madagascar very well governed country by the world bank standards that is nonetheless poorer than zimbabwe where corruption is rampant agree with mixmastamyk that corruption can form crucial part of the downward spiral but the title why poor countries are poor seems to me to imply that the reasons being discussed are the primary ones of course there are lot of vicious cycles at play here

unsure it even worth posting this but here my take groups like the afa really believe that children are better off not growing up with gay parents whether or not you agree with that position should not affect their right to assemble discuss it and act on it ie by boycotting ford for running the advertisements and of course this guy has every right to post his piece about his daughter and grandchild but get really concerned when nebulous laws about hate speech are used to arbitrarily silence whatever viewpoints for example if all criticism of the lgbtqq community is censored how are social workers supposed to discuss the actual effects positive and negative of growing up with two dads or two moms

gt take madagascar very well governed country by the world bank standards that is nonetheless poorer than zimbabwe where corruption is rampant really madagascar seems to rank about the same as zimbabwe on corruption indices see for example the corruption perceptions index http ww transparency org cpi cpi sources en html
interesting was going by world bank rankings http info worldbank org governance kkz which for placed madagascar in the rd percentile while zimbabwe is in the th with regard to their control of corruption measure maybe part of the problem has to do with the difference between corruption and the perception of corruption but lot of it is probably due to the inherent subjectiveness of these kinds of measures fair enough

surprise this tripe comes from san francisco
mea culpa read the first of the article figured knew where it was going and stopped instead the author contention is that the purpose of the invasion was to take iraqi oil off the market forcing supply constriction and increasing the cost of oil allegedly bush and company did this to reward their buddies in big oil and in opec it very different point than what originally thought nevertheless it still all hooey look even if bush wanted to keep iraqi oil off the market don believe this but for the sake of argument let say it true the easy way to do that was to maintain the pre war sanctions even with the oil for food program in place pre war iraqi oil production was tiny fraction of its potential much less than saudi or iranian production and too tiny to have much impact on world oil prices it true that the sanctions were being eroded around the edges there was lot of pressure coming from the europeans who wanted that oil production back on line and also for humanitarian reasons since the sanctions were clearly hurting the iraqi people more than they were hurting saddam hussein however after september th it would have been easy to get the europeans to fully fall back in line behind the sanctions they would in fact have bought into just about anything if it could have persuaded the not to invade iraq can also guarantee you that the saudis would much rather have lower oil prices than to have all that chaos going on just beyond their northern border that the thing about conspiracy theories they just don make sense if you apply even modicum of common sense to them

suburbs took off because when the car was invented families were afraid that cities were obsolete and that if they didn move out to the suburbs quickly they be left in the city with the people who relative to them were lower class only in the past years or so at least with respect to new york are people realizing that hey maybe cities aren so obsolete after all maybe there actually isn much good reason to live in suburbia

think what you re selling is an important factor for example company that is selling website design or any other type of visual design requires an attractive well designed website as far as his point regarding companies wanting to appear smaller and more personal goes we are family run business and do not employ marketing team sometimes small businesses want to make the opposite impression they want to look larger and more sophisticated than they are nicely designed website can help with that he right that an ugly simple website can do the job in some cases but wouldn recommend it to most people

sun sales model is not like dell sales model they were never set up to sell one or two or even twenty servers at time to small companies ve been at plenty of small companies that couldn afford sun servers and decried their sales process as convoluted but the large companies ve worked at were quite satisfied in fact more satisfied with sun and hp model than with dell he not happy because his company is not the audience that sun focuses on his company is the type that sun prefers to leave to resellers what it boils down to is that he doesn like the way that sun does business which is fine but the point still stands that if he really wanted to buy sun hardware all he had to do was talk to var to get it
my point is that using the term american in global context is fairly vague as it could technically encompass many nations in north or south america don really have problem with us based media calling us americans because we know what we mean and united statesian sounds rediculous however using the term to describe your nationality to others of different nationality is construed as arrogant in many cultures

good article while this advice is common it bears being repeated because it is so true and many young people don realize the inherent harm in playing the counter offer game as an employee have only accepted counter offer once and left six months later never accepted another counter offer and as an employer never countered an offer much to the chagrin of some of those that were quitting good advice and wish more people knew to follow it to those that call bullshit this is widely accepted by hr departments and hiring managers nationwide even if they do offer and you do accept trust me they still plan on you leaving and they ll be watching you closely from then on out

there is definite link between world bank imf help intervention and prosperity as well as the many factors others have identified here botswana is good example of an african nation doing relatively well the following is quote from joseph stiglitz former chief economist at the world bank there is one country in africa that has grown at close to double digit rates for thirty years and that is botswana you might ask what do botswana and china have in common the simple answer is neither of them have ever had an imf programme what has to be remembered is that imf loans come with what appear to be well intentioned conditions mostly around liberalising the economy allowing fdi privitization etc the mistake that been made repeatedly is that this benefits corrupt governments and foreign corporations much more than the intended populace free markets and economic liberalisation is boon to developed nations but it cannot be thrust upon poorer ones they need more organic and steady growth all in all hugely complex issue and one that continually divides economists and policy makers

to small company like joyent servers is big purchase but compared to the companies that normally buy sun it negligible sun works directly with less companies than you think and those that are large enough to get their attention still go through vars for most server purchases it only partly because sun sales force isn equipped for lot of direct customers but it also because they prefer to not take business away from their vars and integrators

most americans are science crippled even as we write what makes the country irresistible is that you can put down huge amounts of capital and meet business friendly environments relatively low corruption and huge homogeneous market in that california is culturally closer to maine than west jersusalem to east jerusalem or venice to ljubliana so it better to deploy there than almost anywhere else even acknowledging there are boutique countries like ireland israel and singapore

ok done with my socratic approach gt is mathematics scientifically valid and an abstraction no of course it not scientific science is based on theories and experimentation what theories would someone make about the number that is what experiments would they run attempts at number theory proofs perhaps my view however worthless it is is that god blue art humour are indeed abstractions to help us discuss our experiences however some of these abstractions are useful for some purposes blue helps us describe paints numbers are good in engineering etc some of these abstractions aren useful to us personally or scientifically there is no scientific correlation between praying for something and something happening though can be useful in sociopsychology pretending to believe in sentient higher power apparently makes some other people think we are noble good leadership quality it probably good idea to keep the abstractions in their context and don try to use them outside their sphere of usefulness don use blue as number

this is an insightful article his criticisms of the democrat position on the ports deal is especially warranted the democrats have shamelessly stooped to republican levels of anti arab sentiment just to entangle bush there is still an opening for good ending in iraq if the us admits it has made mistake and stops characterizing any democratic gains in iraq as victories for its militaristic foreign policy other nations may be inclined to help broker peace so that iraq can move on with the process of governing itself

never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity of course in this case it is not entirely stupid to believe that giving poor countries development grants loans would merely end up enriching the ruling class it clear in hindsight but then isn everything as explained in tfa it could have been the case that an entrenched dictator would be best off investing sizeable amount of money in his countries infrastructure so he could reap the rewards in few years time turns out that it more subtle than this is this evidence that the world bank is trying to exploit the populace don think so

id is not falsifiable so it cannot be part of the stream of scientific discourse also intellectually honest people who are into biology can cast doubts on evolution but there distance between them and what we re seeing lately people who have zero regard for scientific method and basically are looking for ways to sneak in their pre existing biases onto the curriculum

this review seems to miss the point wolfram wasn saying hey just found celluar automata he was saying that complex dynamical systems usually modeled with complex mathematics could be represented with simple rules and feedback you don need partial differential equations to describe fluid dynamics you can use cellular automata to do the same thing his other point was that we probably didn notice this before in the last few hundred years since we didn have the computing power to do so until recently
good tips paul
whether or not it new or whether or not wolfram is full of himself is irrelevant and these trivialities really seem to stick in the craw of those in the field perhaps understandably doesn take away from the interesting possibility that our sciences could become much simpler if we used computationally based mathematical paradigm instead of calculus based mathematical one

please see this http reddit com info id cfc am interested in your comment longman models are also cyclical in nature more worrying is the article relentless westernism there good reason for it the liberal conservative divide loses coherence outside the us even western europe has very different definitions for the left and the right so this article isn concerned about the growing population of muslims or chinese because they re going to be neither liberal nor conservative by our definition the crux is that conservatives breed faster than liberals in the us

life simulations and their consequences are the main example of what computer science has to offer few simple rules executed in grid of cells gives rise to complex patterns that evolve as you watch them one way in which this might teach us about the universe was if the universe could be described at low enough level by just such set of rules and we discovered what they were another way this can teach us about the universe is by discovering sets of rules that approximately hold in certain situations enough to be useful is describing behavior am neither physicist nor computer scientist enough to take you any further than that another twist on this theme which goes in the reverse direction how studying nature can teach us about computation is that non linear physical processes can be said to be computing things the book the computational beauty of nature explored this theme in some depth this makes some amount of sense when you stop to realize that the lowest level computer components used to build computers are among the simplest purely non linear components possible switches if the input voltage to the device is below certain level the output goes low if it is above certain level the input goes high one reason non linear differential equations are so hard to solve short of simulating them is that the processes they describe are doing computations if closed form solutions were possible you could determine the state of the system at some point in the future without having to calculate all of the intermediate states which means the intermediate states weren calculating actually anything later states depended on

gt it is fact that all living forms come from previous living forms and gt it is fact that cellular life has been around for at least half of that period these seem little inconsistent if the first is fact then life would have to always have been around in some form or another as long or longer than the earth has been around the thing that gets me about this article is that it is basically saying we accept these things as fact and argue about the how of it later they can fully explain it know ll be down arrowed for saying so but doesn that sound bit like faith statement to you

how many more reasons can the liberals come up with to explain away the term bush presidency is it this living nightmare for you that you still can accept could it be possible that the majority of the people in the country don agree with extreme liberal ideas no not possible it must be because us elite progressives have less children because we re so elightened there are about millions more realistic reasons than this for the recent liberal nosedive in politics probably the biggest being new media like the internet and talk radio

but the unstated assumption is that it matters to such degree that conservatives will outbreed liberals if that is the case the correlation had better be nearly determinative not mere tendency why because otherwise one political faction likely would have eclipsed others in the past due to breeding but this is not the case indeed this disparity in breeding has been in place for decades and yet the country is as divided as it ever was

try not to nitpick and hope not doing so here even if it seems that way at first glance if you offer an argument to support claim it becomes yours otherwise why offer it just for the heck of it to explore possibilities tend to do that before stick with one position to the death and try not to use rhetorical questions sorry if it seemed like one why need there be switch at all one isn born adhering to one political mindset it comes about through many years of living and learning and can even change throughout adulthood the word used was upbringing not birth and notice you replaced switch with change what the difference again not nitpicking trying to understand where you re going our political mindsets are profoundly influenced by the environment the strength of an environmental influence is in direct proportion to how early it is experienced do you disagree with either of these statements your claim simply doesn follow nor do you offer any support for it don know how else to say this but do you have anything else to offer hmm wasn aware had made claim and no all have to offer on this subject is questions discussion can help answer them no

was close but wasnt but you prove my point exactly there wasnt steady stream of liberals winning the presidency before this so this baby bust is fiction clinton was the first elected term democrat since fdr remember eisenhower nixon reagan it dont get any more conservative but at the same time the house of representatives had been domniated by democrats for years until in the middle of clinton decisive victories so where is this liberal baby bust clearly things like ideas personality money etc have much more to do with what side wins elections at any level of government how do you explain huge landslides for nixon in and in the midst of the so called hippy generation this argument for the liberal babies just doesnt hold up agree that parents are the most influencial factor in determining childs inital political beliefs but once the child grows up to voting age they will form there own beliefs on issues which will continaue to change as they age example old people are overwhelmingly republicans doubt they were all born that way

this was dumb no results given

it true that this point is no less relevant today but that not saying much any writer is going to write about topics that interest him and the resulting essays will thus reflect different facets of the author you could say the same of white or any other essayist essays have to be written from experience to be good so as far as can tell this remark is just tautology couched in language that makes it seem like clever and damning criticism
great point about stupid vs smart birth rate too bad you couldnt resist taking pot shot at conservatism it totally unrelated and detracts from your argument one of the most solid democratic voting blocks is the poor which also has high birth rate political beliefs obviously have nothing to do with intelligence

first because artists and scientists create things absolutely means that they are alike if only in that respect it does not mean that they are identical second good programmers are computer scientists is about as accurate as good men are saints just because programmers are often described as computer scientists doesn mean their work has anything to do with science the term computer science is misnomer in many respects and that is one of the strongest points of graham essays third art and science are not mutually exclusive there is an art to science and science to art they are different approaches to the same ideal making great things trying to isolate them to their own respective corners is impossible while they may not be identical painters are like programmers in more ways than say doctors and programmers even though doctors and programmers are both scientific professions

beg to differ most certainly was one of the closest presidential races bush won by only three percentage points which is nothing approaching landslide to be sure honestly don see your point regarding presidential elections proving some sort of conservative majority after all even if were to accept your claim that it proves anything that republican presidents have served more terms in the last years or so you yourself point up the fallacy of your argument congress as you say the republicans gained majority in congress in during democratic president tenure but what you don seem willing to acknowledge is that the democrats had solid majority in congress since you know during the reign of all those republican presidents you giddily name if conservatives truly were in the majority for all this time as you claim it seems rather odd that they held congressional majority throughout the tenure of both republican and democratic presidents would even aver that such trends are somewhat cyclical with clear ebb and flow of conservative and liberal thought in the face of your baseless claim of an overall conservative dominance and as an aside nixon is rather bad example for you considering he ushered in the most sweeping liberalization of the federal government since fdr epa et al he also bad example since you know he utterly disgraced the office such that according to gallup of the public identified themselves as democrat and only republican in http people press org reports display php pageid example old people are overwhelmingly republicans doubt they were all born that way you must just pull this stuff out of you arse because it simply not true http people press org reports display php pageid got anything else

yes but statistically overall partisan allegiance has changed independently of breeding over the last years http people press org commentary display php analysisid however partisan allegiances also change and over time they can change great deal in the and democrats enjoyed as much as two to one edge over republicans in party identification largely on the strength of the big tent coalition their party had assembled during the long presidency of franklin roosevelt but by the end of the president reagan had helped to build modern big tent republican party that wiped out most of the earlier democratic dominance the two parties have been closely matched ever since with democrats generally enjoying small single digit advantage over the gop during the past decade and half in pew july survey for example of respondents said they were democrats republicans and independents

disagree the whole point of reddit is to have number of different news sources all gathered together on one page having major category like politics relegated to separate page would defeat this purpose entirely that is unless all subreddit postings were automatically posted to main reddit as well but that doesn make lot of sense

gt the results are fairer because both parties end up with what they value most more satisfactory results overall yes more fair no what determines fairness is the rough percentage of the property that each spouse gets for example gt each party is given limited number of points which we must assume is identical for each person if not then it wouldn be gt the researchers found that using the software each party ended up with of what they originally wanted rather than the usual split apples to oranges come on so were is the code do we actually get to know anything about the method or is this just slick publicity for some compane know my guess in fact don want to see one more link about game theory http reddit com search game theory unless it makes some attempt at explaining how it works

the ai school minsky belonged to has failed and is dead in its place the artificial neural networks and other probabilistic vaguely biologically inspired architectures and algorithms he fought so viciously against have won they are completely mechanistic no more magical than quicksort say have no intelligence whatsoever and they work very well under the right conditions his unfounded wrong speculations at the end of his famous book perceptrons set back research in the area by years and he is completely unapologetic about it prick

that ridiculous voted your comment down because you elected to use an otherwise good point to ram strained argument down our collective throats saddam is bad example which bollockses up your point by introducing all sorts of unnecessary distractions all with the anti war and such but trying to argue that you re right by virtue of the fact that lot of people are trained to equate saddam to angry is just silly
for those who care ve written blog article about it here http www zwitserloot com the early vote

sure never argued that there been republican majority for the last years argued that its been divided therefore arguing that it has no correspondence with the the low liberal birthrate never said was landslide your people press org info deals with party affliation not with votes so don see how that proves or disproves anything either way it shows nothing supporting the low liberal birthrate theory if you don know that the majority of the elderly vote republican you re completely out of touch with politics this same argument has been applied to pro abortion people pro life pro abortion isn in your blood so the pro abortion crowd isnt going to kill itself off this whole article is just based on silly premise
alternatively vcs are people too id like to read more on ways of making people like your ideas for example making them feel as though ideas are their own making them think that your idea is incredible and motivating people to want to do work for you

think that you are wrong these sites are huge because they use their users do the advertising in order for this to work though people can be made to feel like they re just spouting out the advertising of some company when they recommend new site to their friends they want to feel like an informed person on the edge of what hot lets take an example myspace goes out of its way to make itself look like tom little project made to help people out the site does direct advertising no where another site tagworld does tons of advertising its fancy ajax stuff sucks and it feels like its being shoved on you very few people would recommend this site maybe they should have started porn site as this intense advertising would be more acceptable there similar buzz creating techniques were used by google and many others

if looking at the main reddit and click on the comments for some particular link and that link happens to have come from subreddit am then mysteriously moved into that subreddit for example if click on the new button from within the comment page will be brought to the new of the subreddit even though had been and intended to be browsing the main reddit
the real bs in id can be seen in comments like come up with the same conclusion id doesnt come up with conclusion it starts with an answer and tries desperately to refute the facts that dont fit id doesnt define its core terms like complexity in any useful way nor does it show how evolutionary mechanisms cannot generate complex systems it just relies on human preconceptions that make it difficult to understand processes that take millions of years and to understand how things can be useful without being designed
like addius don have problem with repost besides the article is fun to read
feh it exaggerates the appearance of compression by removing empty lines and putting rule declarations all on one line if you do that to the original reddit stylesheet it comes down to lines anyhow it neat little tool but not really very great all it does as far as could see is extract common declarations in different rules and put em in new rule so if you ve been declaring the same background colour for many different elements say it ll take all of them out and put them in one place which is good if you want to change that one colour everywhere any disadvantages though yes if you ve organized your entire stylesheet by the structure of your pages for easier editing you ll lose all that and if you want to change several properties of one element you ll have to go hunting all over the stylesheet for where all its declarations have been scattered check this out it from the factored reddit stylesheet contactlst usermenu little save sortbox tablelink text decoration none contactlst gray little menu sortbox head stats td color gray contactlst info little font size small contactlst hover little hover menu hover reptable hover sortbox hover stats hover hover save text decoration underline encourage you to try and find all the rules that apply to sortbox it fun like treasure hunt think the tool would be more useful if it simply pointed out common declarations in the css file and left it to you to decide which rules to refactor right now it just goes ahead and refactors to ridiculous extremes
and this doesn apply to programming reddit com because ummm why exactly of course if you actually mean to argue against the entire concept of subreddits then that different matter at least then there no inconsistency
of course that is their justification but it is pathetically weak context is everything here act forcefully could just as easily mean speak out picket petition etc as take up arms and violently overthrow the government the only way it should be interpreted as the latter is if the person in question had some history of attempting or directly threatening such violent acts they only way it would be interpeted that way in the absence of such history is if the government was deliberately looking for justification to target the person for harrassment and suppress their opinions
it nice idea but not sure how it works and so damned busy can afford to the time to alpha with so little pay off faq doesn contain enough info for example who assigned xp at what values
you are exaggerating his initial vision that we ought to be annoyed by our ignorance of how we get ideas and not just our creative ones was correct the field of ai still follows that it now is evident that minsky was wrong about the way to go about it he thought rule based programming was the silver bullet that would solve ai but his motivation and his very high level reasoning that humans and computers are both mechanistic objects with interesting emergent properties was impeccable yes probabilistic structures have replaced rules and logic programming as the king in ai today and wholeheartedly agree that that seems to be the best way to combat real life problems like vision speech recognition knowledge representation amp reasoning mobile robotics etc but they re no more or less mechanistic than the human mind both can be decomposed into units that behave mindlessly the only difference is that humans are running better algorithm we as ai researchers have as our goal to find algorithms as good or better than the ones humans use
sparklines are extremely cool and all that but isn this from edit take it back ve always enjoyed reading old links haven seen before and it was hypocritical on my part to criticize this one guess just didn think before posting this comment sorry

will agree with schwarzwald and go against this marvin minsky mit prof who is probably few time smarter than me puny third year ee student it seems this mit prof is hell bent on brute forcing his way into ai computers as great as they are are deterministic machines you take your input do some fancy algorithms then spit out an output noise is completely undesired this as he has admitted is good for repetitive data manipulations but has obvious creative limitations biological systems are non deterministic they are asymmetric distributed noise tolerant systems capable of emergence behavior more interestingly they use noise in creative ways to aid survival examples can think of are mutation and cellular behavior as simple comparison take your most complex multithreaded program assuming running on single core can read your source code of the program source code of the scheduling algorithm in the os and source code of the random number generator library and know exactly which thread will be running at what point at any time now take petri dish put in single cell remove all interference chemical gradient directional lighting etc and let it grow and divide you will soon notice that you cells through with exactly the same genes will have slightly different phenotypic behavior that to me blows any program you can ever write out of the water now am not familiar with probabilistic ai but it seems to be yet another fancy algorithm with limited use of noise so if my assumption holds you are still building elaborate algorithms on deterministic machines to compete with the complexity of biological systems so my questions is why would you want to program things that will always be dumber than you when you can make systems with emergent behaviors capable of becoming smarter than you
yeah this is complete hoax this article has been floating around the internet for years the first time saw it had the luxury of going to high school with bjarne son he personally refuted the article claiming that it had massively damaged his dad reputation see that it still at work

your whole argument seems to be that biological systems are noisy and machines as you know them are not probabilistic ai is entirely the science of dealing with noise and nondeterminism therefore think probabilistic ai is possible bridge between the two an example work on cmu aibo robocup soccer team one of the big ongoing issues is the process of finding the ball difficult continuing to know where the ball is more difficult since the ball is extremely from the point of view of small dog with resolution camera in its nose doing something with the ball but noticing as soon as possible if the ball is not where you think it is we and the other teams have used probabilistic ai methods all over the place on the dogs for exactly this reason and if you watch the most recent robocup finals it works reasonably well

artificial neural networks have also hit the wall and hard exactly the way minsky predicted in perceptrons probabilistic methods like bayesian networks are somewhere in the middle between neural networks and symbolic ai they are closer to symbols because knowledge representation is localized rather than distributed like in ann this seems to be the most promising current paradigm but again it doesn show that great potential from the start

my mistake in wording was simply trying to stress that the volume especially from such small company niche player in the hosting business isn enough to make them want to step in even very large clients in an area with at least couple of vars will go through reseller sun typically doesn undercut their vars and directs business to them as much as possible in fact you can almost always get better pricing from var than from sun themselves the only orders that ve seen sun get directly involved in are many times larger than what such small company can do typically strategic alliances and orders that make big tech headlines for sun ve seen sun direct mm orders to vars without blinking there seems to be two things here some people think that sun should go direct and some people think that joyent should have used established sales channels that argument been going on for long time each model works for certain type of business in the recent past last several years sun has largely concerned itself with very large businesses the ones that vars work well with that may change as if they try to compete more with dell but the case remains that whether right or wrong there is long established way of doing business with sun that way of doing business worked for years for many companies it doesn work for joyent and also many others it up to sun to decide whether the business of small companies is worth the potential losses of undercutting their vars sun usually chooses to not undercut those vars that may change in the future but that the way they work today some thinks it right joyent and you apparantly think that it wrong the best thing you can do is vote with your wallet and complain that they re losing your business in the meantime ll happily continue working with my var and stress to my sun rep that hate to see my var vanish and lose the steep discounts and integration support get far better than dell or any other direct company ve worked with if they ever decide to go predominantly direct

patents used to protect innovative ideas stopping other parties from copying ideas they were unlikely to invent themselves now patents are more valuable if they are likely to be invented by others these patents are like traps that function without copying from the patent holder the inventive step of patents needs to be set much higher at the very least
think have to agree that the animation wasn that impressive considering what emacs is capable of then again most of what love about emacs probably can be captured in screen grab love working on piece of code or text and when find myself repeating something just open my emacs file and write quick function to automate it hit and then start using the new functionality right away that probably doesn make for sexy video but sure as hell appreciate it good example would be idly wishing that arrow would move line of text up or down just like it does in eclipse ten minutes later it did five minutes after that arrow copied line up or down sometimes wonder though if the productivity gain from doing things like that is immediately lost by my amazement at the new trick wrote those functions in few minutes and then promptly spent several more minutes watching in amazement as they worked exactly as had written them
and why is that first of all it is just true enough to be both funny and sad second if you set yourself up as pundit you have to take the heat that comes with the position third isn the whole point of reddit that there is no central know better just emergent phenomena in bunch of people who really should be working on coding but would rather claw their own eyes out

ummmm rtfd you choose which loans to support diversify your investments and take loss if you choose correctly all of this is explained right on their website oh wait you were looking for free money

in fact your suggestion of this person paul graham is totally inappropriate and entirely irrelevant to this subject matter yes understand simply mentioned someone like paul graham because situations involving people like him contradict what said previously that is most people not liking links being posted to someone every blog post or writing or site but in his case it okay since most people seem to think everything he writes is worth reading see the top http reddit com top paul graham got the st rd th th but digress think what is important to note is there are people who want to read everything paul graham writes and there are people who could care less who he is there are people who don want everyone posting their own blog posts and there are people who don care and want to do that themselves http www netawaremedia com blog there are some people http reddit com info id ea that only care about tech posts and some who don care the problem is everyone going to vote up down things they think are appropriate or not when not everyone has the same opinion on what is appropriate and what they want to see you end up with voting mess http features reddit com info id of conflicting opinions and the majority opinion usually wins think subreddits are trying to help this problem it illogical to think that letting everyone try to control one section is going to work because of so many different opinions likes and dislikes so if there were subreddit with the specific purpose of letting people plug their tech blog posts sure that would be cool people who don want to read through that stuff don have to those who want to post their blog posts can and others can take peek at the top ones if they just want to get the cream of the crop not necessarly suggesting subreddit for that but hopefully you get the idea personally think it would be better if users could make their own subreddits or own sections or communities sure there would be duplicates and lot to sort through but people would gravitate towards the more popular ones and the ones they are interested in that way you could ignore things that you don like or post your own stuff without annoying anyone back to my original idea though the worry is reddit getting overrun by people who are simply trying to profit advertize and spam because reddit gets lot of views allowing users to penalize users or at least hide abusive user links could help make it less worth those people time or at least keep their links away from annoying people reddit is still young and maturing so lot could change the point of features discussions is to try to figure out what would make reddit the best experience for everyone

they re solutions to common problems that must be re coded every time in real language if you have solution to common problem you code it up as subroutine or lisp macro and you never think about it again unless you feel like it this is why design patterns are invisible in real languages like lisp or ve heard ruby it doesn matter how abstract the solution is if it common you can code it up and pass in the things that change as arguments to the macro or function it may sound like just talking about lisp macros but much of this functionality is often captured by first class and higher order functions you make higher order function that captures the common solution and you pass as arguments functions that apply to your particular domain therefore design patterns necessarily imply that there exists code that must be rewritten for each application which in real language would be factored out qed

hola mi amor
gt you never think about it again until it breaks or you want it to behave slightly differently law of leaky abstractions that is why these patterns haven made it into mature library for standard use they are getting there but they aren common yet they are on their way only half of the design patterns are invisible in your real language the fact that you dismiss all languages but for lisp and ve heard ruby as not real makes your claims about other languages little less relevant
guess what if put up wma format people would still whine if put up quicktime format people would do the same if put up an ogg format yeap someone would whine it almost as if whining is second nature to this audience flash is crappy because it is proprietary but it is also ubiquitous and making flash screencast is amazingly easy and inexpensive compared to the alternatives that why used it gif strong point is the fact that all browsers can handle it you don need to install buggy third party plug ins to view it its weak point is that there are no good authoring programs for making nice screencasts so the quality of most gif screencasts are usually lower when compared to other formats all these bickering detract from the purpose of the demo but oh well

gt the sort order always stays the same so as soon as the article makes it to the frontpage digging does not change anything so why should anyone digg anything on the frontpage just for the topstories does reddit work the same way reddit doesn work this way the hot page is continuously calculated so stories rearange themselves all the time this allows hot story to become even hotter and stick around longer if everyone likes it
good one simple is better
the article mentions that google search result pages don validate checked and it actually goes beyond that google front page doesn validate either one obvious explanation for this would be that invalid markup can be shorter for example by leaving out the doctype and google trying to minimize file size does anyone know if there are reasons for it aside from that
find the negative points posted against this article rather curious it too bad there are no comments indicating why did those persons think that the article was untrue or unworthy of attention hadn heard the story about the song before and found it history to be very interesting ahhh the mystery that is reddit
back to my original idea though the worry is reddit getting overrun by people who are simply trying to profit advertize and spam because reddit gets lot of views allowing users to penalize users or at least hide abusive user links could help make it less worth those people time or at least keep their links away from annoying people you seem to frequently use the words problem and worry ies and very concerned about profiteers advertisers and spammers what do you really expect to get from book marking service second of all your item is clear invitation to all kinds of users conflicts of opinions should not be pressing problem and worry given that you have allowed the voting system found under the sub header paragraph titled my votes train filter again what do you expect to gain from this feature what should really be of concern are with those people who have nothing better to do than to vent out their bad hair days on other people with their obnoxious rude comments and are thrilled by it the cause and effect of karma should be heavy upon them do not see you offering any sort of action with these kinds of behavior now or is there reddit is still young and maturing so lot could change the point of features discussions is to try to figure out what would make reddit the best experience for everyone am impressed by your last paragraph like the idea that there room to make changes hoping the balancing elements in nirvana can be achieved gradually just as the word of the mouth travels long way about good and the bad services bookmarking link such as this topic reaches wider audience at speed unimaginable suggestion you may want to re evaluate your faq be definitive if be on areas that have addressed hopefully reducing some of the burden and concerns you may be experiencing

gotta respect the gutsyness of it but did she not choose the act in the movie
section is classic
one of the apparently invincible fallacies of our times is the belief that president ronald reagan tax cuts caused the federal budget deficits of the in reality the federal government collected more tax revenue in every year of the reagan administration than had ever been collected in any year of any previous administration but there is no amount of money that congress cannot outspend the sums of money congress spent each year were on average within about of the spending they approved but did deviate from reagan recommended budgets if reagan wanted to he could have recommended spending dollar year but there would still be financial obligations such as healthcare and unemployment benefits to cover and it would still be his fault if tax revenue failed to make these ends meet reagans economic predictions that such needs would drop drastically as result of overall income growth were drastically overoptimistic on this front military overspending was also his direct doing it is not surprising that tax revenues continued to grow over the reagan period despite torpid growth in it early years as overall tax rates imposed on the middle and lower classes were adjusted to compensate note that the article makes no mention of inflation besides that revenues in each year of the administration exceeded those for all prior is bald lie http www heritage org research taxes wm cfm revenues exceeded that level in eight of the next years in other words tax revenues took all of years to recover fully from reagan tax cuts and this is coming from the heritage foundation of all people smell bullshit

well tellya what netscape actually did knock itself out lou montulli one of the founding engineers of netscape in after wasting year wanking group of new but experienced programmers and one of our misguided founders decided it was good idea to rewrite everything had lot of vested interest since had done most of the original design work on navigator but was unable to supply enough visions of doom to divert the effort the original design had degenerated substantially due to the integration of java and the rapid pace of zig zag development that went on over the course of years there was good reason for large change but rewriting everything was bit overboard to say the least laughed heartily as got questions from one of my former employees about ftp code the he was rewriting it had taken years of tuning to get code that could read the different types of ftp servers those lines of code may have looked ugly but at least they worked http www joelonsoftware com articles fog html

think what gets people is the lack of consistency if you preach against something you shouldn be part of it if you are then you are open to the label of hypocrite if you preach redistribution of wealth you better start with yourself chomsky and other communist socialist anarcho syndicalist fellow travellers would have much better persuasive powers if they rejected the capitalist system and started their own commune kibbutz thing and then showed people how well or badly these communities worked an experiment in new kind of living rather than assuming it works and then trying to impose it on everyone

frankly this is nonsense nowhere does chomsky say that individuals should try to change the distribution of wealth on their own he says that society should address this problem if chomsky were made king and then failed to implement policies leading to redistribution of wealth then you could call him hypocrite mean obviously you can call him hypocrite now but not with out the downside of being wrong

wonder where they get that number atheists and agnostics are much more difficult to identify than other minorities suspect the number is at least and perhaps far greater if you include all of the people who will always say they believe in some form of god when asked but are so completely nonreligious and disregarding of any consequence of belief in deity that they are effectively agnostic or atheistic this is not just people who don go to church but people who never pray who don think religious beliefs should be taught in schools or affect our laws etc they may have some sort of religiosity or vague notion that science can explain everything they may think that well known self declared atheists are wingnuts if they think anything about them at all they may even go to church once or twice year with relatives but religion and religious beliefs have no real influence on their daily thoughts words and deeds they re closeted agnostics or atheists in denial and or just trying to fit in

think mistrusting atheists just instance of the larger reality distortion field that religion emits plus people dislike atheists because we make them feel stupid we re ruining their little make believe party and man it really pisses them off and it goes both ways tho leery of religious people in personal relationships because always end up offending them and atheism is good shibboleth if can crack joke something like blasphemy is victimless crime and the other person gets it and is not offended can probably speak my mind in front of them and if it does offend them best off moving on because the convesation is only going to get worse and what wrong with listening to rock kmfdm stray bullet is fun song
atheism to me is strongly associated with lack of moral beliefs know it simply means lack of belief in god being an atheist myself but someone who labels themself as primarily an atheist makes it sound like they deny believing in any sort of moral values for example some buddhists are also weak atheists but being buddhists means we have very strong philosophical and spiritual beliefs these beliefs are demonstrated hopefully in our actions and this leads to positive public image so yes this is misconception about atheism but wouldn take it as depressing sign about the state of the country if people in the bible belt assume atheists are immoral they might simply be going on the way they link religious devotion to morality not because they think atheists are satanic

this isn really an ad hominem attack ad hominem means attacking the man proclaiming the idea in order to dismiss the idea an example would be attacking chomsky linguistic ideas based on his support of the khmer rouge the have nothing to do with each other so it logical fallacy in this case he attacking the chomsky for not following his own ideas on how individuals should change society person preaching how individuals should live is obliged to follow that advice themselves or be labeled hypocrite
morals are distinct from religion denying god does not mean denying any good morals that happen to also be central to some religion in fact find that some religious people see their belief in god as an excuse to behave in way counter to what their religion teaches believe in god so must be right

find the phrase denying god just an awful description of atheism it assumes that there is god to be denied there are indeed some people who call themselves atheists who do believe in god but don worship him her it that denying god what do is deny the existence of god but even that is bad phraseologoy assert the extreme improbabability of anything worth considering god imo the folks who are so angry that they refuse to worship god whose existence they subtely acknowledge most of those folks are untrustworthy but real atheists aren them
thank you you have just shown the perfect example of that immediate dismissal which was talking about you immediately assume that what believe is false because you ve never personally experienced it its very close minded way of looking at things

gt what is right for jesusphreak might not be right for an allahphreak at the end it always up to you to decide what right and what not it up to you to decide which god you believe and which one you ignore okay so if in my mind murdering someone is okay does that make it okay that is very relativistic arguement

jbstjohn did not claim there is not absolute truth he claimed there is not god that cares about humanity think in this case the right thing can simply refer to whatever social consensus says it is within american society you ll find number of behaviors that are almost universally considered unacceptable including rape murder and theft you ll also find number of behaviors considered positive or acceptable by many people and not so by others these include homosexuality drug use and gambling suspect most athiests are more tolerent of these than thiests especially followers of the abrahamic religions are excluding abortion

religious people in some but not all religions may believe that they ll be punished by god or gods for doing certain things but that doesn mean that doing the right thing isn important to them independently of that potential punishment obviously people can believe that stealing is wrong without believing that god told moses thou shalt not steal but having beliefs about what god told moses doesn diminish the moral sense that some but not all religious people already have anyway so no don think the moral stances made by atheists are necessarily inferior to those of religious people people who think stealing is wrong solely because they believe god would punish them for stealing are different issue and much less common one think

gt what is the right thing to do if there is not absolute truth gt what right to me might not be right to you that the slippery slope you find yourself on if you believe there is no god and no absolute standard of right and wrong trouble is you find yourself on the same slope even if you believe in god every religion and every sect within given religion has its own moral codes and who to say which one is right and which one is wrong for that matter even if you are right or any theist is about an all powerful god that has certain moral code he she it believes in why is that code right it still subjective morality because it still an individual personal opinion the only difference is that that individual is an all powerful being if this is the justification for god morality then it amounts to nothing more than might makes right objective morality is myth

gt religious people in some but not all religions may believe that they ll be punished by god or gods for doing certain things but that doesn mean that doing the right thing isn important to them independently of that potential punishment exactly even devoutly religious people do not rely solely on their faith to guide their moral judgement in fact strongly suspect that most of them would still hold the same core moral values with regards to things like murder rape theft etc if they suddenly lost their faith wish that more people would recognize and admit this

you say that atheists lack absolute truth because they do not have god to hand it to them and that therefore we have to make arbitrary choices about what is right and what is not you too have to make large number of arbitrary choices the obvious one is which god to follow jesus allah buddha lao tzu or ron hubbard but let assume that you have made that choice as arbitrary as it is then you run into versioning issues which jesus do you believe in the various gospels are not to put it gently completely in phase on who jesus was and what he taught and if you wish to be thorough as befits one on the hunt for absolute truth perhaps you should consider the other gospels that did not make the cut to get into the bible some of them post date jesus and many of them offer very different visions of the religion so you ask quite legitimately how atheists figure out the right thing to do and ask you how do you decide which god to worship how do you choose which bits of the religion to take and which not to submit that your problem is harder than mine and that game theory will not help you as it will me

please show where he was happy about it you won find it the bible recorded the good and bad of israelite history just because something in the bible was committed by an israelite doesn mean god approved of it david committed adultery with woman and killed her husband just because he was israel king did that mean it was good in god eyes quite the opposite he was very upset with david actions in that situation
and what does that have to do with rape doesn say single thing about it its stretch to try and say the bible and god is condoning rape there it might also help if you weren quoting verses from tranlsation that is years old was based off of texts from the th century and was composed by people with limited knowledge of ancient greek and hebrew

on the other hand their faith can and often does provide strengthening of those core moral principles even when it isn the sole basis of them religion also gives many people the support of community so even though devoutly religious people usually don lose their core moral values along with their faith it isn unreasonable to think that they could be weakened in the process
gt the only people doing others disservice are the ones who won keep an open mind either way and aren willing to let go of their notions whether they be atheist christian muslim jew buddhist whatever that is reasonable and currently fashionable relativist statement disagree it seems to me that we all make choices that these choices often matter in the sense of having observeable consequences and deciding that everyone else choices are priori equally reasonable requires bizarre set of assumptions about outcomes don care much whether you get into yoga group sex yogurt making or christianity in your spare time it all the same to me don even particularly care if you and bunch of like minded friends gang up and rent out football stadium to hold giant meetings start to care when your flavor of hobbyist starts claiming that their hobby is inherently different than yogurt making and that shouldn make fun of them when they make silly statements to the effect that their imaginary friend created the world in hours few thousand years ago get rather annoyed that someone hobby gets treated differently than mine in that it does not need to pay taxes and owns more property in manhattan than donald trump and go batshit insane when the hobbyists get together and say that their hobby should be taught in schools am happy to accept that christianity makes you happy if you are happy to accept that it has no place in public schools and should not have special tax status

and that is precisely what makes religion so silly its cunning ambiguity allows its adherents leaders to make of it what they will it is cover story for social power believers assert that troubling biblical passages were corrupted in translation but the truth was not due to selective devine intervention and all of this trickery is test for mankind nevermind that if the mind is sufficient to discern the truth in the meaning of the bible it must also be sufficient to discern the truth as it exists in reality therefore the bible is superfluous

get your facts straight beatch the lone gunmen was spin off not knock off
very good is there more elaborate and above minimum introduction or articles relating to the topic
would enjoy category of controversial postings post with large number of votes but score close to zero would be listed in this category
what else did conquering soldiers do with women in those times
so you re opposed to all war wouldn have guessed that from your comments here
move to city
but if they re all that soft in the head what the point do you think someone about to reach higher understanding here
agreed this was entirely forgettable down arrowed
exactly strong atheism as it called is not logically defensible position that where say there no such thing as god which is silly because have no way what so ever of proving that weak atheism on the other hand is stating don believe in god just like don believe in ghosts or unicorns all the smart and reasonable atheists out there who understand the difference between logically sound position and one that isn are weak atheists
the thing that interests me about most of the religious people have seen argue in fora like this is how well they pick their spots the chance of getting an answer to direct question eg how do you decide which god to worship or how do you choose which bits of the religion to take and which not to is virtually nil can tell if it is conscious defense mechanism or if there is something else at work
agreed which is why all their videos link back to their site

very cool idea definitely find this useful the most controversial articles are the ones which lots of people vote on but for which there is lot of disagreement in voting direction uncontroversial articles are liked or disliked by everyone in the current system controversial articles would tend not to make to the top of reddit unless there is majority on one side or the other maximally controversial article which split everyone would get score of and would not be read by anyone this would also address common problem you see with controversial articles some people vote them up because they think it will promote interesting discussion others vote it down because they disagree
you can say all you want but the fact remains the passage you linked has nothing to do with rape and was from one of the least accurate translations available don think every passage can be explained like that but in this case its interesting that rape isn even so much as mentioned and for whatever reason you decided to quote from the kjv why not more modern translation
gt because every single time do know that ll come across gt comment along the lines of everyone knows christianity gt is make believe that the product of bias and conflation ll explain how bias better phrase would be everyone ought to know that the supernatural is make believe this does not single out christians any more than other religions conflation there also the conflation of christianity with christian dogma even if none of the supernatural stuff applies christianity in the form you re defending what jesus said etc has lots of stuff that hardly make believe stuff like love your neighbor and other lessons of compassion etc that self evident or at least highly appealing regardless of the divinity of whoever said it so basically if it takes god to make people believe in precept suffer not witch to live most of leviticus etc then it probably crappy precept if people would willingly accept precept even without god attached to it even if they don always apply it as well as they should stuff like the aforementioned love thy neighbor then it probably an excellent precept and if that how it is then there can be no case for demanding religious belief of others only just and compassionate behavior it then also follows that there are no grounds for distrusting atheists as class and that judging people on their actions not bad idea anyway since even bad men can profess faith will be much more effective guide in telling the jim bakkers from the carl sagans

why the personal attacks just because my friends are in the military doesn mean that those are my personal beliefs gt so you re opposed to all war wouldn have guessed that from your comments here and again never said was opposed to all war there vast difference between certain wars such as ww and things such as killing abortion doctors why the personal attacks don pull that kind of crap on you guys it would be nice if you wouldn try to do it to me its disrespectful and intellectually dishonest

great overview of the economics involved as the article says nafta didn destroy american jobs instead it destroyed mexican lives prior to nafta most of mexico was farmland they farmed corn which has been central american staple for literally thousands of years and made good money too this corn was farmed by rural farmers here in the united states we make lot of money by harvesting corn with machines but mexico is too poor for stuff like that import quotas prevented mexicans from importing cheap american corn nafta required mexico to lift these quotas eventually and they did so immediately before they even realized that they needed to switch crops mexican farmers were up to their necks in debt fortunately mexico democratic constitution in had provision guaranteeing poor rural farmers land to farm on called ejidos unfortunately nafta forced mexico to amend their constitution to remove this provision lucky mexican farmers got to sell their land and work in factory unlucky farmers got their land seized by creditors and became homeless and penniless what sort of factories can you build in mexico that you can built right here in the usa factories that spew toxic waste of course nafta chapter provision allows companies to sue if the government refuses to let them build toxic waste dumps in town http en wikipedia org wiki nafta chapter_ former mexican farmers today are living in toxic waste dumps and sending their children to work in factories so they can pay back the debts they owe when you look at the numbers though everyone made lot of money off of nafta and since both sides benefited it was good trade that economics
gt on the other hand their faith can and often does provide strengthening of those core moral principles even when it isn the sole basis of them this is the common belief but honestly don see any convincing evidence for it when look at religious people see pretty much the same thing see when look at non religious or weakly religious people human beings who have certain ideas on what is right or wrong and who to individually varying degrees sometimes live up to those ideas and sometimes don really haven seen anything at all to convince me that belief in higher power makes person more likely to resist temptation and moments of weakness gt religion also gives many people the support of community this however absolutely agree with this is the one truly good thing that religion has to offer imo in fact say that missing out on this is one of the biggest disadvantages of being an atheist not that atheists can have this sort of community many do centered around variety of different things but it takes little more work to find it doesn come pre installed the way that it does for those that grow up in particular belief system

listen you guys are talking around one another let skip the ad hominem because it useless and do two thought experiments instead one atheists suppose you re christian as far as you re concerned true reference morality exists god morality which is absolute non subjective and non negotiable everything else being equal meeting two strangers on the road whom would you trust more to hold your wallet look after your young child etc the one who lives by the same absolute standard you acknowledge or the one who arrives at his own morality via introspection two jesusphreak suppose you re an atheist you believe there is no god you think the bible the koran the ancient greek stories about zeus etc are all mix of history and fiction you think logic describes the world and you re looking for truth what do you find more compelling deductions made beginning with axioms you choose by thoughtful introspection or morals about the behavior of zeus and hera in mount olympos summary when christian says that you find yourself on slippery slope once you begin defining individual moralities he means exactly that and within its own context this claim is logically correct when an atheist says that introspective morality is just as reliable as biblical morality he also means exactly that and within his context he is also correct neither of you are acknowledging that your arguments only hold within your own context it impossible to argue productively without some corner of common ground anyone have any suggestions about where to find that

it an enticing argument until you consider the view that economics is no closer to science than scientology is there have been economic theories of every stripe including marxist their equal vacuousness is not at all obvious until you have seen few of them come and go whichever theory is currently in vogue presents itself impeccably as very specialised subject understandable only by wonks and beyond simple explanation to layman sure sign that someone is either lying or doesn fully understand their subject what these theories have in common is that they are all designed to fit current facts which makes them very convincing for while until they fail and another theory comes along which fits the conditions of the day better so it no surprise that they catch on when they provide such convenient explanation for things and nobody wants to look fool by denying them so consensus is easily created this way especially among economists who fully believe their own propaganda unlike science economic theories never seem to be able to be solidly predictive economics may borrow lot of stylings from science but the key difference is that science is subject to the laws of physics while economics is subject to the laws of politics
yeah that what the author wants you to think is relevant what is relevant is that there have been thousands of non accidental deaths and tens of thousands of non accidental injuries in pre emptive war based on lies and no amount of statistical wringing will change that fact the author argument reads as if we have some quota of deaths of american soldiers that okay in any given year it doesn matter how flagrantly we throw away lives and limbs as long as we stay under that quota hey good news we got lucky in the accidental deaths category and we re dozen under quota this month so let handcuff some private to bear cub put them in cage with the mother bear and put it on pay per view it statistical sophism and nothing more

you make good point about the extra effort required by cars to get over the speed bump ramp in order to generate electricity and that essentially energy has to come from somewhere meaning that the electricity generated is offset by the extra gas burned by the car as it goes over the bump that is good physics and no physicist do understand that though also got the impression from reading the entry that the ramp itself did not cause much resistence therefore didn necessarily create more work for the car rather it reacted to the weight of the vehicle passing over first compressing then expanding back into position after the vehicle passes as result it is the compression weight which causes the motion that generates electricity even so your point is really good love to see some testing done to determine if the resistance created by the ramp and the extra effort caused was more or less energy than what is produced that would be fascinating must say love cars but you are correct there is great deal of energy wasted internal combustion engines are for the moment the most efficient way to power vehicles based on what ve read the thing that really makes me mad is the continuing trend toward larger and larger vehicles that mostly serve to one up the neighbors can tell you how many individual drivers see in ford excursions on the way to work as driver of either honda civic or porsche depending on my mood fear their size and lack of driver skill

warning you are reading the register hardly good source of information not saying that the story is false it just that the register is the supermarket tabloid of the internet verify anything you read from them with another source for example they broke the story about google banning footage from iraq weeks after that rumor had been debunked they didn post correction until they had squeezed all the traffic they could
this article draws sloppy comparison between economics as field of study and the kind of neoliberal economic theory that sowell friedman et al espouse there are two tiny problems with neoliberalism it predictions don conform to observed events and it succeeds in dismissing its informed critics many of them within the economics field itself only through ad hominem and straw man attacks exactly the kind of demagoguery that sowell claims to oppose the first problem is the clincher and it is the reason why economics as it usually practiced is an ideology rather than science the second is just gravy for the demagogues

gt people in every religion have these experiences religions which are gt mutually exclusive that is foolish statement how can religions be mutually exclusive perhaps you mean that they contradict one another or each claim to be the one true way doubtless in some cases you are correct and in other cases incorrect if you mean mutually exclusive in the sense of logically incoherent or contradictory then you win the prize for truism of the month the fact is that to reason about religion is to miss the point entirely am often surprised by the otherwise intelligent people richard dawkins who do this usually they are fanatics of different sort claiming that religions are irrational or contradict one another or purporting to disprove them is as philosophically naive as creationism to explain creationism can be summarized as the search by religious people claiming to be people of faith for concrete evidence of god existence thereby proving their lack of faith unfortunately they do not then disappear in flash of light

you act as though having many old theories replaced by new theories is something unique to economics when this is actually how the scientific method works mean with any historical prospective all sciences are this way planetary motion is the most obvious example ptolemy had theory for the motion of the planets which was replaced by copernicus which was replaced by kepler which was replaced by newton which was replaced by einstein there will always be progress with revision in science as theories and models approach and converage on the truth it is also important to realize the the formal study of economics is relatively young and is still growing it bit unfair to compare it to physics which is arguably the oldest science

for an atheist jefferson sure talked about god lot even postulating that our rights are endowed by god would say that jefferson had an independent mind as did washington franklin and many other ffs of the time but he was more of deist than an atheist he never explicitly called himself deist but he did say that he was unitarian and did say that his faith derived from the works of men who were deists note also that when he rewrote the bible jefferson bible is pretty cool he did not remove all references to divinity just all references to supernatural activity miracles which is in concord with deism as for lincoln while he did say am not member of any christian church recall from reading about his frequent discussions with pastor of his day can look up the details if you care he seemed to have views basically in line with deists that there was divinity it had some form of providential relationship with the cosmos but it was not personal nor was it revealed through book and jesus was prophet not god there was time when we could elect presidents who weren christians washington deist jefferson deist madison deist who later converted when he was bitter old man monroe deist lincoln perhaps others but alas those days are gone at least for while

experience teaches that when someone takes some absolute stance it is to be expected that with little prodding all the exceptions start to pop out the prodding bit would not be necessary if you said killing an enemy is ok in some circumstances ww when you go around saying things like what is the right thing to do if there is not absolute truth what right to me might not be right to you that the slippery slope you find yourself on if you believe there is no god and no absolute standard of right and wrong then you better tell up front that your absolute standard does allow killing in certain cases and not waffle about turning the other cheek it is after all an absolute standard so there should be no room for interpretation would be very interested in hearing how you apply your absolute standard in deciding on when it is ok and when it is not ok to kill

as an atheist no fan of religion at all but can at least distinguish between varying degrees of scam this is religion that preys particularly on the weak extracting money from people before sharing the religion the church is proprietary with all its doctrine hidden behind strictly enforced copyright curtain the kindly grandmothers that knock on my door chat with me and tell me everything about being jehovah witness are soooo much less insidious have feeling that pretty much any christian church would let me know everything about it without paying for the privilege and don know much about islam but have feeling could become muslim without paying the mosque anything the german government doesn even recognize scientology as legitimate religion because it more of commercial enterprise would consider scientology funny if didn feel bad for all the people victimized by it

well just happen to view the god question as sort of higher order shibboleth if you will don find it interesting in itself at all and think that discussing philosophical matters with people who do is waste of time postulating the existence of god just happens to be the first axiom of all major religions it part of their very language traditional thing one either decides to go on life spiritual journey using religion for guidance or one doesn if one does one has to learn the language discussing out of context the validity of one axiom is pointless and yes shallow

of course but religion can certainly be taught without being taught as science perhaps mattknox should not be making such ridiculous generalisations
the problem is some of these algorithms can really be compared mean binary sort vs rsa the former is something more or less intuitive while the later has extensive mathematical background and research behind it but place solving system of linear equations on top of the list you really can do much without linear algebra

gt other experts told journalists at the vatican yesterday that many of the thousands of executions conventionally attributed to the church were in fact carried out by non church tribunals gt what the church initiated as strictly regulated process in which torture was allowed for only minutes and in the presence of doctor got out of hand when other bodies were involved so if we torture vatican historian for only minutes and in the presence of doctor then it not that bad right cause think that would be fun way to learn about history

gt you act as though having many old theories replaced by new theories is something unique to economics when this is actually how the scientific method works but unlike economics our basic understanding of physics is not changing every years or so also the predictive nature of science allows us to do things like put man on the moon without relying entirely on trial and error economic theories are typically useful in understanding and anticipating markets whose members subscribe to the same theories gt it is also important to realize the the formal study of economics is relatively young and is still growing it bit unfair to compare it to physics which is arguably the oldest science had been wondering if you could say that economics was simply primitive science and analogous in some ways to say alchemy even if that were true we obviously shouldn base national policies on this kind of theory any more than we should turn the courts over to witchfinders but we do have economists who might just as well be reading tealeaves half the time with huge influence on government business and the markets russia is an example of country whose economy was pretty much ruined because they listened to the prescriptions of experts pulling just such confidence trick the problem with considering economics as science is that while an islamic revolution in the usa would cause catastrophic failure of current economic theories gravity would continue as normal

think it because the score of comment children are taken into account for the ranking you ll note that childless negative comments are always pushed to the bottom given that comment automatically starts out as you are in essence hitting the up arrow for the parent someone with better observational skills than or someone who knows how it actually works can probably clarify this
it occurs to me that people are obsessing here with prove in the deductive logic sense feel fairly certain that the various molecules making up the air in my room won spontaneously decide to crowd into one corner of the room yes it theoretically possible but pretty dang unlikely similarly one may come to conclusion on the existance or non existance of god in similar sense and consider the issue effectively closed not in that it is absolutely certain in the sound deductive argument sense but in the probabalistic sense computing bayes factors and so on and such may be one way to do this my point is claiming you can disprove it so you should believe it even if true is like saying can be certain that if played the lottery wouldn win so should consider the probability that win using observation and other prior information one may make inductive inferences not certainty but potentially close to or at least construct confidence levels for various specific religions and such note am not here claiming anything about which side would be the most supported by observation merely pointing out that making big deal about the potential unprovability in certain highly restrictive sense of proof gets us nowhere imnsho

it seems to me that economic views can be characterized in terms of freedom to make economic decisions another economist thomas friedman wrote book with the title free to choose he and dr sowell are in the camp that wants individuals to be freer nader wants individuals to be more bound by the community the community overrides individual choices by passing laws community decisions as to how much each person should contribute in support of the government are reflected in the income tax code how much the community thinks landlord should charge tenants is reflected in rent control laws what the community thinks land owner should do with his property is reflected in zoning restrictions what the community thinks the price of imports should be is reflected in tariffs what the community thinks worker should be paid is reflected in minimum wage laws by the word community mean the people through their elected representatives sowell argues that decisions made in this way are not as good as when decisions are made directly by the individuals involved collectively the individuals directly involved in economic decisions are called the market

its totally different christianity is not proprietary by design in fact it teaches openess and generally good principles scientology is cult that makes lot of money by design just because selective implementations of christianity have taken advantage of people the religion was not designed to do that people are always going to pull one over on others to get ahead but the two religions are totally different

scientology says you need to pay to hear the truth christianty says you need to believe to go to heaven they both force people to give up things money or your free mind to be promised something intangible that there isn any proof about they are both scams and the difference is just matter of degree the biggest difference is that since scientology has been around for only short time we can call it crap much easier than something that is lost in years of lore and mythology if christianity started up years ago with the same gospels we all be hanging more crap on it then we do scientology now guy died came to life and it biggest proponent is guy who never saw him till after he was reborn

just to clear everything up on what is and isn firefox fault firefox does keep separate setting for different users each user profile is stored in their own windows provided application data folder in this case as well firefox didn show the bug reporter another user settings see comment https bugzilla mozilla org show_bug cgi id when the guy had installed firefox and chosen never to save there was only one user account on the computer this data went in the application data folder of that one user account only later was new account created for the man obviously this was fresh account it was the woman computer so she kept using the original account which had the guy firefox profile guess the rest of the story is now clear

if one decides that it highly probable or improbable that god exists then depending how strong that probability is they may take it as an effective certainty similar to how sure it theoretically possible to see macroscopic global entropy reduction but it ain gonna happen ie the second law is such statement of probability that it can effectively be considered certainty much less strongly but still very strong it nearly certain that if played the lotto wouldn win the jackpot sure theoretically possible but wouldn bet on it yes while it reasonably probable that will win any specific lottery the probability of any specific person winning is negligable what saying is that through observation and incremental evidence accumilation one may come to possibly strong conclusion on the existance or nonexistance of god it may not be certainty proof but so what strong supportable probabilistic statement either way would be pretty dang good no

you don need to be working with continua to do linear algebra vectors are abstract so their representation doesn matter and scalars only need to come from field basically things that have division like amp things in between or sometimes just commutative ring with identity there are plenty of discrete vector spaces you can even define vector spaces with finite scalar fields or finite sets of vectors one example of this last is finite precision binary arithmetic what your computer does the theory is useful too signal processing people have defined whole theory of discrete integral transforms etc etc etc
this is by far the best article on free speech have read it is bit long but make sure you at least read the last section it is sublime wish had written something like this gt free speech does not mean accepting all views it means having all views in the open so that we can challenge the ones we find unconscionable today we do the exact opposite we ban certain views because they are deemed unpalatable but there are others we are also frightened of challenging because we don want to give offence to diverse cultures gt gt the very fact that we talk of ideas as offensive is indicative of the problem there are many ways of disagreeing with someone views we may see them as irrational reactionary or just plain wrong but to deem an idea offensive is to put it beyond the bounds of rational debate offensiveness is an affront to an entrenched tradition religious precept or one emotional sensibilities that cannot be erased by reasoned argument it is notion that sits well with the moralizing emoting often irrational approach to politics that we all too often see today gt gt but hatred of course exists not just in speech hatred has physical consequences racism can lead to racist attacks homophobia to anti gay violence in november two men were sentenced to life for murdering black teenager anthony walker with an axe simply because of his skin colour isn it important then to limit the fomenting of hatred to protect the lives of those who may be attacked simply by asking this question we are revealing the distinction between speech and action saying something is not the same as doing it but in these post ideological post modern times it has become very unfashionable to insist on such distinction gt gt in blurring the distinction between speech and action what is really being blurred is the idea of human agency and moral responsibility because lurking underneath the argument is the idea that people respond like automata to words or images but people are not like robots they think and reason and act upon their thoughts and reasoning words certainly have an impact on the real world but that impact is mediated through human agency gt gt racists are of course influenced by racist talk but it is they who bear responsibility for translating racist talk into racist action ironically for all the talk of using free speech responsibly the real consequence of the demand for censorship is to moderate the responsibility of individuals for their actual actions

here my problem with emacs especially with the kind of attitude this article espouses can say much about other uses for emacs but image it used more for programming than anything else tips like these might make you very fast typist but who really is limited by their typing speed when developing software anyone who is needs to work in leaner language that doesn encourage writing so much boilerplate java looking at you or work on more interesting problems that actually require some thought plus in all the talk about greater efficiency the years of practice required to master emacs never seems to get incorporated into the higher productivity equations now ve got nothing against emacs itself but any editor that encourages this amount of ridiculous tinkering just isn worth the trouble text editor is means not an end in itself

scientology forces you to give up your money and your free mind jay walkers and murderers are both criminals would you insist on equating them too not that think christianity is as innocent as jay walking but just trying to make point that degree really does matter and even though aliens are lot funnier than boring rising from the dead story that not the point hang lot more crap on scientology not because of their silly stories but because its so much more harmful to the life of it followers than mainstream religions are

slavery was fact of life in biblical times and very different to th century slavery slaves back then were simply lower lower class of society they had rights could own property and hold jobs in ot times hebrews could sell themselves into slavery to pay off debts and buy their way out when they liked is taking out mortgage much different every years all such slaves were released unconditionally the jubilee year as for morality the bible gives both absolute principles and relative applications all people are made in the image of god is absolute in society where slavery is commonplace this is expressed as laws protecting slaves well being in the th century it prompted christian reformers wilberforce amp co to call for slavery abolition the same absolute morality is at work by contrast an atheist has no logical reason not to treat his fellow human being as pure property to be abused at will same deal with polygamy in genesis one man marries one woman and divorce is not an option they shall be made one flesh in ot times polygamy and divorce were facts of life hence laws were given protecting women in the nt jesus says these laws were concessions not endorsements moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard but it was not this way from the beginning matt there is clear way things should be similarly the age of consent varies with custom but the underlying belief that child abuse is wrong is absolute and common to all societies highly recommend reading mere christianity by lewis it is wonderfully clear headed logical and straightforward presentation of the christian world view

the typical emacs user uses it for everything programming writing documents in something like docbook or latex notes you are of course right when you say people should use leaner language the reality however shows that of languages are limited by typing user interface interaction in the phases between the big thought processes in more primitive editor these often take up thought capacity and distract from keeping the thought on the problem you try to solve if you know emacs pretty well they only do this the first time you encounter problem you then automate it and the next time you can concentrate fully on the program text whatever you try to write

the writer obviously has no clue what they are writing about beyond the amount of testing required to even release fresh of vista code it would require more time than they currently have to rewrite it combined with obvious glaring errors such as one of the key components of the consumer version of vista is the media centre code this will be an optional package in the same way that microsoft currently sell professional and home version of xp with vista there will not be seperate media centre sku so if it sold in the same way that professional and home are sold how can there not be seperate media centre professional and home have seperate skus the article just seems like an amateur writers attempt into technology rather than someone who actual works in the business

stuff about moores law is about half way down disagree with the article on some points he blames the fact that we re not progressing because we aren working on parallelism and seems to think the standard programmer who makes living out of or java is to blame because they dont want to learn my answer to that is this we don expect college kids to write refereed journal articles we re not getting paid to push the envelope but put cell processor in game system and people will push it things won change all at once because you cant think up new hardware paradigm new software paradigm and everything inbetween all at once but it will come look to the gamers

every latex user and nowadays every web standards aware web developer knows the advantages of separating structure from styling modding this up because the rest of the world also needs to know it is possible to use wysiwyg word processor to work in this way though never touch the font dialog in word and make heavy use of styles to mark up headings block quotes etc it always worked really well for me think knowing markup languages like latex and html makes it easier to think in terms of document underlying structure
there were no known casualties the demonstrators would have made gandhi proud this is hopefully just the end of the beginning and in country where the kgb still operates the demonstrators courage has to be admired many of them willing to have their names fully attributed in print
actually his other two comments amounted to of the women know none of them are involved enough with web development software development systems administration or any of the other fields that require you to know full product names and development releases given the nature of gender ratios in it employment positions don see why it is not safe to assume that most women don know enough to file bug with that level of technical detail hell most men don know enough either what find disturbing here is that the gp was speaking in the context of his direct experience from that it was much more likely that the guy in the relationship was behind the posts this says nothing about the capabilities or knowledge of women in general it only speaks of the women that he knows think the argument would be better served by looking at gender employment trends in web and computer development administration related fields but that takes longer to type and is only really necessary in the face of someone misinterpreting your statements to cast you as misogynist
the funny thing about this is that they re using the fact that certain founding fathers were deists to resist certain items of christian agendna bet one of the things they re thinking of is intelligent design which is totally in line with deism

as someone who just started learning to use emacs think am probably better suited to answer this haven undergone the years of practice it takes to master the thing so maybe can put it in context emacs is all about optimizing your interaction with the computer for speed it is true that given an ideal setup most programming work is limited more by time spent thinking than time spent typing that said of the two thinking is the more important part so why not try and optimize away the rest of it the tinkering that goes on is entirely optional in sense emacs is program for creating domain spocific editing environments much like domain specific languages the advantages of that scale depending on the topic that said it still works as basic text editor personally would rather learn one editor that is generally capable of doing what need than several that together fill the same requirements

this article is seriously misguided the government religious perspective of the vast majority of the founding fathers was restricted to the question of recognizing an official state religion it had nothing to do with whether or not government should be guided by christian principles and morality that was all but assumed by practically every founding father you can lay your hands on jefferson included the article goes to great lengths to highlight deism and thomas jefferson views on religion however jefferson reviews on religion were regarded as amusing and on the fringe by the rest of the founding fathers washington has great quote mocking jefferson novel religious views but have been unable to quickly dig it up as for jefferson his comments on separation of church and state have been grossly exaggerated into some kind of brilliant statesmanship in my opinion more skeptical neutral approach would be to recognize the fact that he was attacked by clergymen on the religious question during the campaign which was perhaps the most divisive and controversial presidential election in american history though he eventually won that election he became even more deeply suspicious of the influence of religious leaders his comments against the influence of clergymen in the political realm should be viewed through the lens of man bitter about the hell he received during the election and ready to exact his revenge in other words politics as usual

agree that the article is pretty bad after quoting steroid expert and physician who says that that testing only catches the dumb and the lazy the author writes if local police departments took this same approach to law enforcement our country would be in real trouble but many people do believe that sending the police after drug users is futile and waste of public resources and in any case that has nothing to do with whether or not smart athletes and doctors can conceal doping from drug testers because it been shown time and again that they can these drugs have their own limitations the recent book on barry bonds doping notes that after he started his steroid regimen his injury rate went up along with his home run count because his outsized muscles were tearing at his tendons and bones think athletes should be allowed to use whatever performance enhancers they want if they re willing to accept the side effects including back acne according to bonds ex girlfriend and injuries guessing many athletes will choose not to use them anyway
there is an explanation all texas agencies are periodically reviewed by sunset commission to determine their need and effectiveness the tabc recently went through such review and it was determined during their review process that they were not doing enough to ensure public safety recommendation was issued and extra money was given to the tabc to better enforce the liquor control and public intoxication laws the tabc recently hired about two hundred extra enforcement officers and added this tactic to their toolbox for fulfilling their legislatively mandated
it doesn matter if you take cab home you cannot be drunk in public period your lack of adequate control over your physical actions and mental judgement makes you threat to public safety and your own health
it the id people who pulled out the appeal to popularity this is just smacking them down for it
let me see if can distill your argument correctly so the more law enforcement you have the more of chance that someone will break the law therefore we should have less enforcement which would result in less crime did get that right

it called signing statement and bush has been quite enthusiastic in his employment of them before reagan they were generally used innocuously to clarify how details might be implemented in policy or to complain about things the president would have preferred be written differently since then they have been used more and more as way for the president to re write the new law with bush they have effectively been the unitary executive version of line item veto though their is ambiguous at best surprise alito thinks they are the best thing since sliced bread in fact he was working in the reagan justice department when he helped draft novel proposal to use signing statements as way to expand presidential power while bush supporters will rightly point out that clinton used them as did bush and reagan before him in fact clinton used it fewer times in his entire years than bush did in his first year alone and has continued to employ them at at least that rate since then

like the way he describes some of the techniques but think the description of dynamic programming is little confusing yes you cache solutions to sub problems but just because you use cache doesn make it dynamic programming for example if you used cache during divide an conquer algorithm it would do no good since there are no overlapping sub problems the key aspects of problem that is best solved using dynamic programming are the problem can be broken into sub problems the optimal solution to these subproblems can be combined to form the optimal complete solution this is also true of divide and conquer the sub problems will overlap you will hit the same sub problem through different paths this is the key difference that makes caching necessary think of the computation tree of divide and conquer as tree and that of dynamic programming as dag directed acyclic graph
so it using the pixel page as type of collecting sponsor that pretty neat but does anyone with little bit of artchitectural background have any idea if such chip can be built realistically

can you really claim that signing statements would hold no weight on supreme court that includes one of the architects of the signing statements as power grabs maneuver alito in the justice department wrote they would increase the power of the executive to shape the law he made it possible for ed meese to declare in to make sure that the president own understanding of what in bill is the same or is given consideration at the time of statutory construction later on by court we have now arranged with the west publishing company that the presidential statement on the signing of bill will accompany the legislative history from congress so that all can be available to the court for future construction of what that statute really means it has been more than just commentary for bush that he has applied it with such regularity demonstrates how useful he believes it to be for crying out loud he has used it more times in his terms than it had ever been used previously in all the other presidencies combined it has been his statement of interpretation used in every case to attempt to broadly expand presidential authority narrow down legislative authority and effectively cut the judiciary out of the process altogether signing statements are included in the published legislative history of the laws they are attached to they are an attempt to change the understanding of the intent of the law congressional intent is an important consideration the courts use when they have to interpret law they ll use committee reports floor statements hearings etc from the legislative history now the president is speaking as if he were member of congress and his presidential intent is part of the legislative history big deal you say the court can just ignore it that is unlikely what with champion of this philosophy now sitting on the highest court in the land when asked about it during his confirmation alito refused comment about it leaving the suggestion that this will be coming before the court in practice the president has used signing statements to disapprove of over specific provisions of legislation that became law and to declare constitutional challenges to those provisions the presentment clause of that very constitution http www usconstitution net xconst_a sec html spells out if he approve he shall sign it but if not he shall return it with his objections to that house in which it shall have originated who shall enter the objections at large on their journal and proceed to reconsider it by declaring his intent to not follow particular parts of the law he is using the signing statement as back door form of line item veto against the clear language of the presentment clause the presentment clause was used to strike down law that had given line item veto to the president signing statements have become power grabs that have unbalanced our system of checks and balances our founding fathers were quite concerned about the unchecked power of unitary executive having just broken free of monarchy madison wrote about it in the federalist papers and paine in common sense now we have president who says that particular sections of the written law run counter to his philosophy of presidential power and so they just don apply maybe you are right that not line item veto that despotism

love this quote on the market the market is good example of evolution in action the try everything and see what works approach this might provide perfectly morally satisfactory resource management system so long as there was absolutely no question of any sentient creature ever being treated purely as one of those resources the market for all its profoundly inelegant complexities remains crude and essentially blind system and is without the sort of drastic amendments liable to cripple the economic efficacy which is its greatest claimed asset intrinsically incapable of distinguishing between simple non use of matter resulting from processal superfluity and the acute prolonged and wide spread suffering of conscious beings it is arguably in the elevation of this profoundly mechanistic and in that sense perversely innocent system to position above all other moral philosophical and political values and considerations that humankind displays most convincingly both its present intellectual immaturity and through grossly pursued selfishness rather than the applied hatred of others kind of synthetic evil

while agree that it more important to address the underlying behavioural problems not sure how well your suggestion would work in practice it evident that unfortunately many people go to the cinema not to watch the film but to simply to pass the time particularly for young males giving them that kind of attention and power over the proceedings might make matters worse suppose it really depends on the audience ve certainly seen that strategy work for theatrical performances at one large production the entire play came to stand still while one particularly rude female audience member took call on her mobile some time passed before she realised that she was the centre of attention of the entire theatre needless to say every other member of the audience rushed to ensure that their phones were switched off

gt yay let use possibly dangerous technological quick fix for social issue while suppose it technically true that preventing people from using cell phones could endanger someone it seems pretty unlikely in theatre in the event of an emergency inside the theatre there are multiple exits fire alarms and most likely some sort of phone in the lobby in the event that you re likely to receive an emergency call don go to the theatre do think that anybody using jammers reflective paint or faraday cage to block calls should post notice
perhaps there middle ground in ireland the telecoms regulator has introduced licensing for mobile telephony interceptors http www rte ie business comreg html which blocks non essential calls in limited area but still provides access to emergency services gt interceptors allow the creation of quiet zones where mobile phones will not ring but where calls can still be made to the emergency services or to lists of approved numbers gt the quiet zones are different from jammers which prevent all calls including emergency calls by interfering with mobile phone networks interestingly in many european nations mobile jammers are actually illegal although countries such as france have made jamming legal in public places http www wired com news culture html

comet applications can deliver data to the client at any time not only in response to user input the data is delivered over single previously opened connection this approach reduces the latency for data delivery significantly the architecture relies on view of data which is event driven on both sides of the http connection engineers familiar with soa or message oriented middleware will find this diagram to be amazingly familiar the only substantive change is that the endpoint is the browser while comet is similar to ajax in that it asynchronous applications that implement the comet style can communicate state changes with almost negligible latency this makes it suitable for many types of monitoring and multi user collaboration applications which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to handle in browser without plugins

gt in the event that you re likely to receive an emergency call don go to the theatre if you re likely to receive an emergency call you re probably not going to be going anywhere however speaking as father any time my wife and go out there is chance that could receive an emergency call and sure as hell want to be able to take that call can only hope that any theaters that choose to install these devices make sure they place clearly visible signs warning potential customers about it if not they better make sure they have good lawyers
mean that if you take two religions which cannot both be true one true way for example believers from both religions have religious experiences which confirms their deity or whatever consequence of that is that religious experience of this sort should be dismissed by anybody honestly searching for one true way answers and or answers to questions about the nature of the universe to assume your relgious experiences are dismissed by atheists simply because the atheist has had none is to entirely miss that point

it really too bad that posting sign on the door saying that cell phones will not function inside isn enough to protect them from that liability oppose the kind of so called tort reform that artificially limits damages but really wish judges would throw out suits where the injured party knew what the risks were going in to the situation
gt however speaking as father any time my wife and go out there is chance that could receive an emergency call and sure as hell want to be able to take that call that fine and do think anybody blocking calls should post consipicuous notices so that you can choose to avoid such places if it concern for you just don think jamming should be illegal if it can be reliably confined to the interior of building

suggest to make it legal to give sucker punch to anyone starting cell phone in theater you want to talk fine do it while being punched around by hundred people
gt fail to see how disgruntled cell phone user wins the argument of chose to be in the stone building which prevented my phone from working and missed an important call and therefore deserve money as do however the argument was actually making is very different without adequate warning to potential visitors the theater would be very much liable for customer unkowingly missing an important call gt ve missed important calls because was sitting in classes in the tomb that is the uw math and computers building but have no recourse against the school how would cinema be different because the situation you describe is one where the loss of signal is entirely unintentional and unexpected the basement of the student union building at unm has the same problem so clearly nobody could be liable for that however if the theater deliberately employs cellphone jammers or as you suggested covertly builds their theater out of em blocking material in poorly conceived attempt at plausible deniability then they are very much liable for the consequences if they fail to warn those who enter the building like it or not mobile phones are part of life now many people depend on them and if some establishments are going to deliberately disrupt them for reasons of etiquette they need to warn their patrons courtesy goes both ways
pity the fool
gt just don think jamming should be illegal if it can be reliably confined to the interior of building agree as long as regulations require notices to be posted conspicuously don have problem with it will also go out of my way to avoid any establishment that uses such devices personally think it lot more rude to sever form of communication ve come to rely on than to briefly interrupt my movie or meal with the latest cent ringtone suspect there are lot of other people who feel the same way it ll be interesting to see how the market forces shake out on this one though oh and for the record am very considerate of others when it comes to my cellphone always keep it on vibrate when wearing it and keep my conversation quiet enough to be unnoticed or take it outside altogether
gt hoping the media will pick it up and make it sound like some groundswell bingo since reputable news sources have avoided this story thus far that gives you fairly significant clue about its credibility and people have been whispering about impeachment for ages
gt perhaps there middle ground in ireland the telecoms regulator has introduced licensing for mobile telephony interceptors which blocks non essential calls in limited area but still provides access to emergency services good idea but it still doesn solve the problem of blocking an important incoming call it fact of life now that many people rely on mobile phones for critical communications if we re going to suddenly allow private businesses to make them inoperative those businesses should be required to warn visitors

it is not hoax in that in the second heading of the article it says status undetermined don buy the idea that it says advertising archives on the edge makes any difference either we are very likely not looking an original copy from housekeeping monthly but an archived copy hence the phrase on the edge of the page as to this being some sort of terrible thing for women to be taught one needs to remember also that men were taught to always work hard never to bring the office home in any sense unless it was to have the boss over for dinner and even then work shouldn be discussed and that only an abject failure would have wife who works to put it in sort of inverse feminist terminology man had to be utterly stoic and tireless worker who provided for his family every need until he died prematurely of heart attack caused by the stress that doesn sound like such good deal any more perhaps it may seem quaint today but what we are really looking at is only clearly separated gender roles not the subservience of one gender to another the reality was that husbands and wives were taught to work hard and to be appreciative and considerate of the contribution the other was making considering the current state of the family it might be time to reconsider our modern notion of the husband wife relationship

actually the current administration is not saying anything about bills per se but rather about the bill ability to restrict the actions of the president if bill were passed to limit the president term to years regardless of whether the president signed it or whatever it would be illegitimate because such bill is the administration is claiming that any limitation on the president is similarly and that therefore no matter what bills are passed and what actions are taken the president is in the clear it is ridiculous position but it is the one that they are taking and it does not involve getting lawmaking power for the executive branch

here their explanation from http www com http www com gt the traditional secular rational values dimension reflects the contrast between societies in which religion is very important and those in which it is not wide range of other orientations are closely linked with this dimension societies near the traditional pole emphasize the importance of parent child ties and deference to authority along with absolute standards and traditional family values and reject divorce abortion euthanasia and suicide these societies have high levels of national pride and nationalistic outlook societies with secular rational values have the opposite preferences on all of these topics gt the second major dimension of cross cultural variation is linked with the transition from industrial society to post industrial societies which brings polarization between survival and self expression values the unprecedented wealth that has accumulated in advanced societies during the past generation means that an increasing share of the population has grown up taking survival for granted thus priorities have shifted from an overwhelming emphasis on economic and physical security toward an increasing emphasis on subjective well being self expression and quality of life inglehart and baker find evidence that orientations have shifted from traditional toward secular rational values in almost all industrial societies but modernization is not linear when society has completed and starts becoming knowledge society it moves in new direction from survival values toward increasing emphasis on self expression values gt central component of this emerging dimension involves the polarization between materialist and postmaterialist values reflecting cultural shift that is emerging among generations who have grown up taking survival for granted self expression values give high priority to environmental protection tolerance of diversity and rising demands for participation in decision making in economic and political life these values also reflect mass polarization over tolerance of outgroups including foreigners gays and lesbians and gender equality the shift from survival values to self expression values also includes shift in child rearing values from emphasis on hard work toward emphasis on imagination and tolerance as important values to teach child and it goes with rising sense of subjective well being that is conducive to an atmosphere of tolerance trust and political moderation finally societies that rank high on self expression values also tend to rank high on interpersonal trust this produces culture of trust and tolerance in which people place relatively high value on individual freedom and self expression and have activist political orientations these are precisely the attributes that the political culture literature defines as crucial to democracy this newer map http www com images feature_pics valuemap gif calls it self expression instead of well being think the red arrows with poor and rich points to general trend that as countries become richer they tend to place more emphasis on secular rational self expression instead of traditional survival values

the first problem of not converting ideas to products could also be due to the fact that their prioritization process is probably lacking clarity or not moving fast enough and probably not getting enough resource support to move forward from beta to an actual product every engineer is supposed to work on their pet project for of their time and think there are too many ideas beta products that google management is finding difficult to prioritize having said that the personal time for engineers is what is going to differentiate from yhoo msft and other companies

am not surprised an economist from the world bank would reach this conclusion and think he is right spent fair number of years working at company that produced banking software the software was in use at the government run bank of zimbabwe posb the software had known security problems which were ignored for years because they helped to enable slush fund used by mugabe henchmen suddenly after years of being ignored the security problems became top priority to fix why the world bank and imf were going to increase the amount of money being lent to zimbabwe it really payola imho but they needed to audit what happened to the first money as result the books needed to be cleaned up and the the backdoor locked before the inspection organizations like the world bank imf and the un are utterly corrupt and cause far more damage than good

gt the administration is claiming that any limitation on the president is similarly and that therefore no matter what bills are passed and what actions are taken the president is in the clear as the poster you are responding to said gt it is not up to the executive branch to decide that law is if bill were passed that limited the president term to years the president proper course of action is this step veto step immediately get judge to grant temporary injunction suspending implementation of the law until it can be tried in court note that the judiciary would be extremely deferential to sitting president of the united states making such request playing the what if game that he couldn get temporary injunction in such situation is fantasy to the point of absurdity step bring it before the courts and get the law thrown out absolutely nowhere does the constitution give the president the authority to do anything to bill placed before him except veto it approve it or just ignore it and if he ignores it it becomes law by default in ten days gt it does not involve getting lawmaking power for the executive branch this is semantics at best and sophism at worst the president is approving laws that congress did not approve that he claims to be doing so because he supposedly overriding the parts of the law is neither here nor there under the argument that he employing he can claim that anything and do absolutely anything he wants to any bill placed before him change it in any way if you want to say that not getting lawmaking power for the executive branch uh okay fine but it not legal

very clever idea and an interesting read one thing comes to mind though the author claims that mono munging with an appropriate basis file turns legally copyrighted work into non copyrighted work or at least not copyrighted by the original owner because it is derived from both the element file the copyrighted work in question and the basis file content not copyrighted by the copyright owner of the element and because the mono file does not contain any content that can be clearly seen as belonging to the element file it cannot be legally considered derivative work he provides good legal justification for this argument however when dealing with fuzzy cases like these what is or is not legal is ultimately up to the courts to determine and with the current legal climate what it is it not hard to imagine the courts re interpreting the law in some way that determines that mono files are derivative works of the element and basis files but what if we take it one step further as he points out in his article digital representations cannot legally be copyrighted it is the content represented by that interpretation that is copyrighted now imagine you create file call it the resulting file and release it into the public domain then it is clearly legal for anyone who wishes so to share this file through ftp mail snail mail or whatever means they wish now what if you took some element file copyrighted by private party and reverse engineered your own basis file that through mono would convert the digital representation of the element file into the digital representation of the results file clearly this can be freely shared by you or anyone because it in the public domain if you then release the associated basis file into the public domain you have two files both of which are digital representations of public domain content therefore both of these files can be freely shared with no legal problems but if you take these two files and combine them together in the right way you produce digital representation of copyrighted work it hard to imagine any way that any court could legally ban the distribution of either the results file or the basis file because both are digital representations of public domain content therefore the only truly illegal act in this scheme is the combining of the results and basis file to reproduce the element file that happens on an individual computer and is nearly impossible to regulate know that what describing sounds almost exactly like what the author is describing but there one crucial difference in his example the result of the mono munging is file that is essentially garbage it not clear representation of any meaningful content in my case the result of the mono munging is file that is the digital representation of work that has been released to the public domain this clears up some of the legal fuzziness the biggest drawback to this scheme is that it would require the generation of separate basis file for each element file each song or movie or whatever but this could possibly be automated oh and of course the other drawback is that it would lead to legally untouchable sharing of copyrighted content that would be wrong

scheme is non pure functional language you can add things to scheme as well as to common lisp that allow type annotations common lisp is not functional language but can be made to act like one however just because you can do something doesn mean you should haskell does things for you that scheme or lisp would have to be heavily augmented to do for one it is pure functional language that enforces the lack of side effects through strict type system this makes some things possible such as stm http research microsoft com simonpj papers stm stm pdf pdf the haskell type system forces stm atomicity to apply to side effect free code check the paper for good example monadic programming is definitely possible in scheme http okmij org ftp scheme monad in scheme html but with nowhere near the syntactic support that haskell has now all of that said ve done bit of work in haskell and doing anything disk io intensive is royal pain in the arse composing monads can be awfully confusing as well which is what you end up having to do if you want to say add an error monad to an io operation it makes up for that sort of thing when you move on to more heavily algorithmic logical programming for instance writing an evaluator in haskell has to be one of the most pleasant experiences ever writing simple lambda calc interpreter is close behind the factorial as far as the haskell hello world app goes check it out it gauranteed to make your brain twist around bit and would wager that even if you don use it you ll come out with an expanded perspective

think this is good question and quite devoted to haskell there are many arguments for static typing here one the compiler is right more often than am not being snarky here the compiler is sometimes wrong there are some things that are type safe that the compiler doesn understand but for every instance of that there are probably or instances of me making type error that the compiler does catch this saves me ton of debugging time when might trace into functions and see how generating the wrong type with he haskell way know before even get to debugging that some errors are not going to happen

in theory there no difference between theory and practice in practice it nice that we learned that ad hominem attacks aren logically viable but in practice you need to consider the sources of things and whether they have an agenda why well the simplest example is that any interesting argument will have involve some facts and if those facts have been cherry picked or arranged via paid study or perhaps just asserted as such without backup they re not too valid and the whole argument built on them is questionable it why when you see study paid for by the tobacco industry that says smoking isn addictive you shouldn necessarily assume it true now of course determining which information you can trust is big problem and is something other much smarter people than noam chomsky have talked about at length

it interesting that any discussion of religion is inevitably centered around christianity even if not explicitly most eastern religions don suggest the presence of single supreme god and instead try to describe some unseen order of the universe in fact the only religions that loving god figure really applies to are judaism christianity and islam which are really all derived from single source

gt ve never understood the sense of the argument that because europe is running out of productive highly skilled white people they should import bunch of dumb unskilled non white people who don work much and who hate the white people probably because nobody is making such an argument there is an argument that larger population is necessary for the economy and that immigration is one way to achieve this but nothing about skin colour or who someone likes or dislikes

suppose you wanted to make lisp not garbage collected or support massive concurrency like erlang or make it purely functional like haskell or make the whole language have an inferred type system like haskell these are useful things while won say that these things can be done with common lisp they don tend to spring from nice clean macro packages like the mop they are more like research forks of lisp dsls that you have to swallow wholesale when you deal with core ideas like this you run into situations where you can appear change the core ideas of the language in little islands of code dsls but on the whole the language still is what it was to begin with

the idea is that instead of giving money blindly to the governments allow private interests to do business there can personally say know whats best but from what ve heard and read the thing the worst countries in africa need most is infrastructure if you have private interests trying to make money they will be inclined to set up system of trust this allows money to actually do something other than line the pockets of the corrupt government of course the idea from there is that the more stability in the country the more it will progress towards freedom and away from corruption

think the use of the word overpopulation comes from sense of crowding the population of the is very nearly twice what it was when was growing up and the resulting sensation is not at all pleasant watch movies with unscripted street scenes stock footage made before and you will see what mean more often than not the streets of even busy city like los angeles will seem strangely empty once you begin to pay attention that emptiness used to be the norm and miss it starting to feel like the people of the planet gideon http tinyurl com tzp
this seemed an outdated propaganda and strawman laden screed is there really an anti population lobby today is that code for people who want to allow family counseling people in africa to mention condoms or is the article just so old people are net resource producers don crap out copper do you yes know he goes on to redefine resources but the point stands resources and are all cheaper than before today steel most other metals and oil are all more expensive than previously also have to think of the complete devastation of cod in the north atlantic capitalism solves all the world problems ach just going to stop now don get me wrong think capitalism does the best job of feeding housing and meeting the other needs of the world population than any other system but it needs some oversight and free market doesn solve every problem ever conceived of how that for knocking down strawman of my own

gt there is no population problem population growth is the result of the plunging death rate and increasing life expectancy worldwide that is progress unless birth rates drop further unsustainable progress gt the growth in human population has been more than met by increases in the production of food and other resources including energy famine in the th century is political rather than an ecological phenomenon we are not running out of resources and real prices of raw materials are lower than ever before only the price of labor consistently rises population growth and economic growth are compatible between and while the world population increased sixfold real gross world product rose about fold people are net resource producers people and technology magnify the economic value of raw materials or use resources available to them to provide further services these raw materials however are physically limited current estimates state maximum populations of about billion if every inch of arable land were seeded with the best available gm crops however if we wish to preserve such luxuries as global biodiversity and occasional animal protein much of this land will need to be reserved for other purposes the time to address these problems is now not in years time when such limits may be reached poor nations have many difficulties among them trade restrictions by richer nations and predatory financial arrangements that lead to corrupt thuggish regimes that impoverish their people and thereby eliminate any competitive threat they might pose to industrialised nations it is certainly the case that improved economic welfare leads to drop in fertility but many poor nations have immediate and pressing problems meeting their people basic physical needs due to harsh climate limited technology or both in addition market liberalism is often smokescreen for the introduction of large scale corporate cronyism that chiefly benefits first world industrial magnates and often results in gross human rights violations nike springs to mind there were indeed terrible adverse side effects to population restrictions in china and india and while it is true that economic prosperity should be the most efficient means to address population growth many couples in developing countries insist on large families as means of economic insurance against old age and child mortality and what is rational for the individuals in such case is irrational for the society at large this is exactly what government exists to address many social ills are the result of self reinforcing chains of factors that cannot be tackled by addressing any link in isolation be it trade barriers or cultural attitudes gt the late roger revelle of harvard university whom gore claims as mentor estimated that africa asia and latin america alone simply by using water more efficiently could feed to billion people http dieoff org page htm few years ago for example group of catholic bishops misinterpreting thought exercise by roger revelle asserted that earth could feed billion people anonymous various social scientists have made estimates running as high as billion livi bacci these assertions are based on preposterous assumptions and we do not deal further with them here gt more population means more creators and producers both of goods along established production patterns and of new knowledge and inventions current knowledge and inventions are more than adequate to address the problems of developing nations but they lack the resources to take advantage of these gt actually natural resources do not exist at all all resources are manmade until we can defy the law of conservation of matter and energy their supply remains limited gt doubters need only study the quality of life on the pre columbian north american continent when several million indians barely scratched out their subsistence amid the same natural resources that today enrich the lives of billions of people worldwide that woudl explain why skeletal remains of many amerind tribes indicate precipitous drop in living standards after european colonisation for the survivors that is but this is another topic
that because it was written ten years ago the world population had grown by about billion people since then
whenever hear someone equating growth with progress have to stop and look around in the natural world for something analogous to refer to for comparison and as far as the philosophy of unlimited growth is concerned the only example can find is the cancer cell
of course the idea from there is that the more stability in the country the more it will progress towards freedom and away from corruption believe what you said is part of the reason the us has propped up some less than desireable regimes taking the long term view it is better to have an unelected strongman in charge who will provide enough stability to country that corporations will invest in infrastructure than to have nice democratically elected government that could change at any minute the strongman will be outlasted by the infrastructure and once people have clean water food and medicine then they are ready and able to consider democratic elections

find it interesting that the picture doesn bring up third viewpoint one that many religious people hold today which believes both sides of the spectrum as in do indeed believe that god loves people and wants there to be sun but also believe that there is scientific method behind how the sun works the separation between religion and science is not as black and white as this picture implies
by the way the official expansion is digital rights management

one of cato main thrusts is limiting government to that end the testimony includes gt what the poor nations suffer from is not too much population but too much government but they fail to notice that government is obvious side effect of population the more people there are the more those people demand government to mediate their relationships with the rest of the population crypto anarcho whatevero libertarianism is simple prospect when you are living by yourself in cabin in the woods in fact that pretty much the default governmental philosophy in such situation but when you are living cheek to jowl in packed urban center it is far too easy and common to get screwed in big and small ways by some random stranger robbed rented an apartment in structurally unsound building live next to hazardous waste site sold defective products or improperly handled food deli counter guy puts his thumb on the scale when he weighs your food it is all very easy to live by implicit or explicit contracts when the number of your interactions are few but the more people you interact with the less you are able to demand integrity from those people and the less integrity you have to provide in your transactions human impulses being what they are people will tend to maximize their personal return often at the expense of others in subtle and obvious ways example you go to pizza hut you buy what you presume to be cheese pizza it standard commodity item lots of places sell cheese pizzas lots of competition in the marketplace lots of choice for you the consumer pizza hut buys its cheese as commodity from low cost producer makes sense pizza hut wants to maximize its profits in commodity business likewise that cheese producer wants to minimize its costs and maximize profits so it turns out that they add lot of less expensive than dairy ingredients water retaining vegetable starch in it something that good old fashioned made straight from cows milk cheese doesn really have but surprise that starch filler tends to make the cheese go bad in the freezer faster and bake differently than conventional cheese it will make big bubbles that will get real dark and thus look unpleasant to most pizza consumers so the supplier has to add an additional un cheese like something to reduce this tendency silicone http reddit com info id substance not normally considered to be food now ask you can an individual go in to any particular pizza hut and negotiate with the person at the cash register to get pizza that doesn have any of that silicone starch cheese in it will the public representatives employees and managers even know what the heck you are talking about will they care if they do or will they be more concerned about their paycheck the natural tendency of person is to try to create an entity that will work on their behalf to prevent this and other kinds of injustice the more people there are the more those people will be clamoring for government to operate on behalf of their collective interests believe that limited government is much more practicable with limited population but that not what we have and that not where the population is headed but cato says that all growth is progress and that must include population growth after all more people more consumers and more producers oh except government growth that kind of growth is bad

since you ask ll try to point out few things first many people including myself have probably thought long and hard read books and discussed with others various religious questions when you dismiss that as special degree of mental shallowness you insult us you continue this insult with saying it takes an exceedingly simple mind to actually believe which is another insult and number of respected philosophers and other clever folk are out an out atheists hume dennet dawkins regarding the whole logic debate there are two important sub points one is functional can disprove that invisible elves make my engine run but it doesn mean should believe it the second is consistency while might not be able to disprove that there is some sort of the supernatural being who exists outside of the measurable universe this is not the same as judaeo christian god the idea of an omnipotent moral god who cares about what happens to people here think this hypothesis is inconsistent with the facts the world as we know it and reject it you are getting down modded because you basically seem to be running around insulting atheists or throwing in non sequitors

that only sort of true in literature and rhetoric it is true that several eastern religions do not subscribe to the western idea of god however in modern practice the difference seems superficial for example though buddha did not promote himself as deity most modern practitioners of buddhism in the east worship him as the one true and easiest way to nirvana they needn sit under tree for vast stretches of time to attain their enlightenment they simply ask for it this is philosophically different from an all powerful god but nearly the same in practice

taxes provide incentives to change behavior that true but higher tax doesn provide the incentive to spur on whole new market often times tax incentives simply get swept up in the economies of scale it cheaper to pay higher tax to move whole lot of product via container ship to the bay area than it is for small nearby farms to swap crops especially with the real estate prices around there this may cause dismay for people who feel guilt at consuming energy but as said elsewhere they have another choice they can die with the way people get swept up in the desire to do good that they ignore the facts of reality that may be good option for them but seriously though it not as cut and dried as what the smallest carbon footprint that can be created it about having enough stuff on hand and enough stuff coming down the pike for all the people who are going to buy it finding the right price high enough to pay for the costs and make little on the side but low enough to keep people buying and keep the pipeline flowing at optimum capacity people have this notion that the box on the store shelf costs as much in time and materials as it takes for one to decide whether to purchase it and that replacing the box they took from the shelf is simply matter of getting another carton from the back even in similar fields the problems facing say microbrewery are not identical to those facing anheuser busch to say nothing of the problems of the oatmeal supplier vs the frozen waffle producer and the folly is that by spending ten minutes coming up with an insight that seems fresh and unique to them they think they ve circumscribed the problem when in reality they ve just begun to scratch the surface
demonizing energy consumption is problem in itself regardless of what you do you will consume energy yes there is valid argument to the fact that oil is polluting and that it will eventually run out there also may be argument to the fact that these two points may cancel each other out not to say that we shouldn be at all concerned about efficiency or emissions but when the time comes we will either switch to something else or be forced to be less wasteful the universe itself is not very descriminatory in its energy use there are trillions upon trillions upon of stars that just sit there and burn off fuel should we start dreaming up ways to extinguish stars because of their inherent wastefulness

judaism christianity and islam are all semitic religions hence their concern with law and judgement don forget it was the middle east that gave the world law in the st place legalistic thinking is part amp parcel of the memetic structure there period end of statement however christianity in particular even in its infancy is highly polluted by greek thought the greeks invaded bunch of times and so was eventually more palatable to the romans than the other two semitic religions perhaps the largest influence on christianity came from st augustine bishop of hippo which even though that in north africa was essentially roman at the time christianity development has essentially been in the western tradition of yelling amp screaming at each other and occasionally getting together to see if they agree on anything

even if majority bought into the idea that people own their own bodies most societies have made such tangle of social services that one cna always find an excuse to resrict the behavior of others for example arguments ve heard for mandatory motorcycle helmet laws when not pushng the no one has right to be that stupid view assert that accident victims will end up receiving medical care subsidized in one way or another by others so others are entitled to restrict the activity in truth though think few really believe people own their own bodies about the only place hear such an idea is from people who argue for legalized abortion on the basis that woman should control her own body yet these same people typically do not also support legalizing prostitution or heroin

clearly the writer betrays certain nostalgia for the past when for whatever reasons marriages were more stable but she herself having turned down marriage that might have been good by some standard is hardly the picture of feminine acquiesence to patriarchal values probably it was her frustration at wanting to be married and yet finding it utterly impractical that prompted her to search for the sociological reasons behind her dilemma now suppose one can despise her which do not for wanting to be married and for believing that the right kind of marriage could be better for her children perhaps one sees all of that as pandering to patriarchy but think you have to put ideology before human nature to dismiss what she says as uninteresting

people generally believe that other people should only have the freedoms that they themselves exercise someone who uses drugs but doesn carry gun for protection probably beleives that drugs should be legalized but not guns and vice versa hence the stereotype of libertarians as libertines many people have tough time understanding why you want others to have freedom that you don exercise
there are obviously cases in which illegalization and enforcement increases the amount of illegal behavior grey is saying that this is one of those cases

very amusing but where are the references for the numbers he is slinging around think he way off oats are per bushel in bulk making the ridiculous assumption that the farmer had in energy cost for that bushel then his two ounce serving of oats used ounces of oil lbs bu gal oil it unlikely that it was more than oz so he is off by at least factor of as an interesting aside note that oats in the store are times what they cost in bulk thanks to marketing and middlemen maybe he should raise his own oats he would need an area ft by ft to be planted tended harvested and milled that would produce the bushels of oats he eats bu acre assuming oz per day for year he need to fertilize the area or he would probably need three times that much space for sustained yield to set aside for bad years add another if he doesn have that big garden or doesn want to make the considerable effort he could give the farmer instead of giving trader joe for his year supply that what food co ops are all about but of course he doesn have any solution just complaints and disgusting images of oil floating in his oats oh and roasting pound of coffee takes about half oz of oil not quart
facetiously would say that in chess the first of the game is tactical and the second is strategic it does have strategy that why some humans can still beat many computers and why advanced chess is so appealing cause it lets the human and computer both shine at what they excel would bet that kasparov with workstation and good chess program could beat the pants off of deep blue or any other computer do agree that go is much more strategic
maybe not all the points are as universal as bjorn assumes but they ring true and thoughtful enough to have real value the real trouble is getting these points across to management

too binary bjorn isn saying that developers don want any pay just that pay isn the overriding concern it is in other personality types after certain baseline feeding the family and the occasional luxury purchase more money simply has lot less motivational meaning for developers than it does for others pay isn how we keep score after that baseline is met know that ll take bigger challenge over something that pays more even significantly more

his main argument amounts to this the way to stop the war is to pretend that there no war in the first place or less generous interpretation the way to stop the war is to admit you lost worked for long time at our county division of substance abuse am no expert but do have lots of hands on experience legalization would only ensure that this stuff got into more peoples hands and bodies once it in the first time the battle is almost over it so difficult to get people off of meth it turns law abiding citizens into criminals mothers into murderers fathers into deadbeats it takes away your will to be productive it zaps your energy and your ability to discern between right and wrong this stuff is highly addictive meth addicts don turn into thieves because they need to get drugs they turn into thieves because they stop believing it wrong they starve their kids because they re high and they stop caring they get behind the wheel when their high because they lose their ability to think rationally if you legalize it you will justify those who want to try it just once then they ll get hooked it nearly impossible to just try it once the war is on you can stop it by hiding your head in the sand and you certainly won stop it by making it legal go back to the drawing board you re wrong
the author mentions how the remarks are humerous but unfortuneately it isn funny many people including myself are quite baffled by how gpl code can be used so if you take some gpl code compile it with non gpl code into binary you have to release all the source so if you have one php file that is gpl and use it on your server with another php file that is not gpl you only have to release the file source and any modifications you made to it what about strings and passwords as modifications does that count as part of the code if you release run business on program written in php and some modules are in gpl do you have to release the code for all modules because one of them is php even though they aren compiled together but they are part of one overall service available to the public completely avoid gpl code at all costs which seems to defeat the purpose of gpl which is to make code available to programmers but it not because programmers have to make living and many times that means closed source
gt his main argument amounts to this gt gt the way to stop the war is to pretend that there no war in the first place that isn true and it appears disingenuous for you to say that gt legalization would only ensure that this stuff got into more peoples hands and bodies you say that without evidence and he convincingly contends that it is not true gt this stuff is highly addictive the rest of your argument amounts to cataloguing of the horrors of meth use which is true and well addressed by the linked article in the second paragraph grow some reading comprehension
especially the part when walmart said they don condone this and they aren hotel not everything is pr piece
also ll point out your hands on experience would not give you any evidence for or against your statement that it is impossible to try it just once that is certainly true for the people you worked with they were not able to try it just once there are however many people who are able to try it just once those are the people that you would never see at the county division of substance abuse

actually was wondering the same thing mean if you were just watching the video and didn know it was done by the north koreans would it still be creepy
legalization would only ensure that this stuff got into more peoples hands and bodies honestly how many people do you think are out there right now that would just love to get thier hands on some meth but cannot because it is illegal prohibition has not decreased the demand for drugs just as alcohol prohibition did not decrease the demand for alcohol and gambling prohobition has not decreased the demand for gambling the problems of addiction that you mention exist today while drugs are illegal making drugs illegal does not make these problems better and think that it probably makes them worse
bah round corners are sooo hexagonal corners are the new round
this guy argument is niieve drugs aren illegal because they are unhealthy or dangerous drugs are illegal because the entire banking and political structure depends on the illegality of drugs to make money this is not money from fines prisons or mere control of populace but direct money from the lending and laundering of drug money this activity affects all levels of politics all the way down to small city municipal campaigns and all the way up to major military and cia actions to argue that legalizing drugs will bring freer society will do nothing take the money out of political campaigns and you will go long way toward making drugs legal and freer society please pardon any misspellings

find it curious that every gung ho endorsement of latex tex attempts comparison between the latex way and the wysiwig way and degenerates into cheap shots at ms word ms word is not the last word in typesetting folks magazine editors and book authors who care about style don sit around wasting time doing textual markup try using some grown up software like adobe indesign or framemaker and see how productive it makes you my argument is this wysiwig is good there is good software available to do it and it is worth the money perhaps the last one is controversial adobe most expensive bundle is where you get the works in any other trade say photography or carpentry or building construction you wouldn balk at spending this sum of money if it is directly relevant to your trade or helps you do it well no self respecting contractor will buy car to ferry him around but there is this strange resistance to putting in chunk of money on software even if it helps you save time have seen any number of books where the authors acknowledge the contribution of some latex wizard and am speaking of professional computer scientists who should have no problem figuring out latex you don see anyone being thanked for their framemaker or pagemaker skills do you latex is hard for even simple things like changing the style of table of contents or changing fonts see this http www cl cam ac uk users rf pstex latexcommands htm for sample one really shouldn require faq entry for changing fonts am computer scientist and know latex well and admire it for its typesetting capabilities esp mathematical text but daresay those who claim it to be better than wysiwig have not acquainted themselves with real wysiwig software and no not an adobe lackey merely satisfied user
gt the harm that has been done is irreparable there are more than american kids that have been killed tens of thousands of innocent iraqis have been killed which no one in the really cares about those people do they never hear anybody lament that fact was one of those american kids over there and the thousands of iraqis that have been killed sadden me at least as much as the soldiers who have died all we see are the pissed off arabs on the news trust me there are many many innocent iraqis who just want to live in world where arbitrary death by violence isn commonplace echo his sentiments with the notable caveat that don trust the american people to come around hope he right and wrong
the problem with the freedom argument is that many of his examples coincide with usage of shared resources individuals personal freedom stops when it infringes on others freedoms is it personal freedom to ignore traffic rules and drive down the wrong lane of traffic at high speeds seatbelt rules use the same logic that says that is not ok for example insurance protect all drivers from accident costs people who do not wear seatbelts dramatically increase accident cost and thus increase the price of insurance for everyone so its case of personal freedom being limited because of its effect on the rest of society

the reality of price gouging during crisis is that prices are exactly not magical system for the transferrance of accurate information about supply and demand in crisis panicked hoarding and precipitous price increases feed back into one another and cut any legitimate information out of the equation suppose he against trading halts and circuit breakers in financial exchanges is volatile price fluctuation really the best way to disperse the news about say violations in exchange listing policies or extraordinary corporate events these are the times when trading halts and circuit breakers are applied so that price speculation can be made to wait for accurate information to catch up and rationality to be restored wonder how he feels about those pump and dump stock schemes that sometimes make it past my spam filter when the price goes up is that really magical system of information transmission about the value of the item guess maybe it is but the message is incomplete until the stock gets dumped and those who fell for it get stuck

if mcdonald wants people to hang around for the coffee they re going to have to turn the temperature settings on their burners way down remember that court case about where the person sued mcdonald because he spilled hot coffee in his lap well the discovery process turned up some internal mcdonald documents that showed they intentionally kept their coffee so damned hot that fewer people would be able to drink it fast enough to get free refill before they had to leave and of course that mcdonald knew this resulted in lot more scalding injuries but judged that the risk was worth it for the cost savings so anyways if they want people to actually stick around with the coffee it ll have to start off at something lot closer to drinkable temperature

he thinks the tsunguska comet started global warming hilarious what about the megaton bomb the russians set off what about mt tambora or krakatoa you can get lot more from wikipedia than from this article recommended global warming global dimming global warming controversy global warming is an exceedingly complex topic and unfortunately highly politicized the funding researchers get is related to their preconceived position on the issue there are many interesting aspects including the injection of ice crystals into the upper atmosphere by aircraft noticeable changes were observed in the few days after when the aircraft were grounded we just heard that the peak flood of rivers is occurring weeks earlier than normal but you have to read carefully to understand that for rivers in north america above the th parallel the rivers south of the th parallel are actually peaking later than normal my take global warming is real but much smaller than people think most of it is not caused by man activities

it is not me who said that dude it is lasker who said that now you may call lasker bullshit but tend to believe him rather than you you see chess board is too small too crowded of board is occupied at the begining and has to many restricting and complicated rules to have any meaningfull strategy during begining and middle phases of the game it is close fight it is all tactics even opeinig sequences are often have names like gambit to trip up which emphasizes local close fight ve been playing chess alot until found go that game completely took me over it is played at absolutely different much higher level begining of the game in go first moves are all about strategy but it also has very rich and deep tactical component lot of chess like close fights especially in middle of the game so go has best of the both worlds strategy and tactics besides computers that already win humanity in chess still suck big time in go year old kids leave computers no chance not even talking about any serious players

the rest of your argument amounts to cataloguing of the horrors of meth use which is true and well addressed by the linked article in the second paragraph grow some reading comprehension by the way there is no linked article in the second paragraph read the entire article and all linked pages before posting something you did not do would invite you to take your own advice and read the entire article again including and perhaps especially the second paragraph he got an agenda and an opinion and believe he glosses over some really important issues to get to his arguments offered an antecdotal perspective on the matter not full fleged counter argument he convincingly contends that it is not true thought his argument was anything but convincing again wonder if we read the same article kudos to the author for wanting to try something different but in my opinion his approach is just wrong know the system is broken know from first hand experience but legalization isn going to happen and it shouldn no matter how you cut it up when you legalize you condone honestly how many people do you think are out there right now that would just love to get thier hands on some meth but cannot because it is illegal you missed the point know of lots of kids who aren dying to get their hands on meth but they would consider giving it try if it were legal yes lots of them it not about the people who are already seeking it out and trying to get their hands on it they can already get it it that by legalizing it you condone it and make it ok to try it and there is healthy evidence to support that even one use can lead to addiction and that one time can lead to brain damage and other problems and again from someone who spent countless hours working with meth users and lots of time studying it his argument was anything but convincing it actually pushed me the other direction
prices do take time to spread the point is that regulation doesn help it just hurts by destroying that information politicians have far less information than people directly involved in the transaction and as far as buyers taking time into consideration time is valuable to most people just like money is it may make sense to buy something when you have the chance rather than risk losing the opportunity letting people make their own decisions about whether or not to buy is far better than putting bureaucrats in charge
yes you make good point should not have used such all inclusive statement there is healthy evidence to support that meth is highly addictive and that even one use can lead to addiction my antecdotal experience supports and confirms this evidence you are correct though that there are certianly people who have tried it and not gotten addicted who knows what the long term effects are for those individuals though perhaps brain damage perhaps nothing it definately depends on the individual

by the way does anyone find it troubling that this writer compares meth to alcohol and marijuana you re talking about apples and oranges here no you re talking about apples and hamburgers if you want to talk about legalizing marijuana then use your research on marijuana meth is very different than alcohol and very different than marijuana it unwise to make any assertions that the legalization of meth is akin to the legalization of alcohol or marijuana

interestingly enough the author forgot one of the biggest reasons why black women don marry us prisons are loaded with blacks in age to get married and since people tend to marry within their ethnical group the choice of black men available and marriable is extemely narrow compared to other racial groups the other reasons may have their importance but the main one is the one above in fact there was an interesting article read last week about black women marrying outside their ethnic group and that seemed the way to go for black woman who wants to get married also saying that young black males enjoy playing in the field more than women of the same age is just as true for white people

when lasker says it you realize he is being somewhat facetious don deny that chess is largely tactical and you make good point about computers and go what happens lot in chess is that you make strategic decisions based on tactics might launch an assault against my opponents king position in an attempt to force quick checkmate he defends adequately and don see way to checkmate him however in order to defend he brought forces nearer to his king and let say left couple of pawns dangling well now based on tactical appraisal of the situation recognizing that cannot mate my opponent if he continues to defend in such fashion must make the strategic decision to capture the pawns he has left vulnerable and steer towards hopefully won endgame

anyway thought the term was kidult which is much better coinage

always find it fascinating how in the the us funded and supplied the iranian shah and the iranian military only to get that thrown back in their face when the iranian revolution took place in the late and then the us funded and supplied hussein in his war against the iranians only to get that thrown back in their face when iraq invaded kuwait and let not forgot osama bin laden it seems like whenever the us has tried to stick its hand where it really doesn belong it gets bit wonder when we ll learn

ok here are my arguments the first major event in ww or the civilization clash or whatever you call it was did not happen as response to particular event preceeding it but as an ideology motivated attack on the us by fundamental islam by the above mean that while us actions certainly contributed to fuel fundamentalists anger towards it what is really happening now is confrontation between contradicting value systems the us might withdraw its forces and try not to do anything that could annoy bin laden and yet the very existance of it and it values will always cause friction with fundamental values witness denmark
think ordering comments by points is good thing because the quality comments and ongoing discussions are the ones you get to read first while pointless or bad comments sink to the bottom of the page it true though that it hard to find the new comments on coming back to large comment section but ordering threads by seniority won fix that since new comment may have been added to an old thread guess the flat unthreaded ordering is the only solution to that though ve never used it myself or maybe an option to colour code the comments by freshness fading yellow highlight behind the hours ago text won look so bad

of course it did not come out of the blue nothing ever does you know what trying to understand is what exactly caused it was it wrongful actions by the west or actions that did have justification yet annoyed extreme islam for example think gulf war was justified yes it surely annoyed fundamental muslims so does the concept of women voting are we supposed to live our lives according to al qaeda values so that we don risk another since already at apparently most readers here would say yes

so many stories come out related to politics that think it would be helpful for the reddit developers to add politics subreddit
hrm considering that one of the primary reasons iraq attacked kuwait was because saddam hussein found evidence of slant drilling of iraqi oil say as sickly as it sounds that when another foreign nation violates your soverign lands its justifiable to fight back saddam just took it too far by conquering kuwait which made our good friends the bin ladens nervous as for the rest of the middle east never underestimate politicians ability to see past their differences when there huge profit to be made last heard hamas was changing their language so that they could keep receiving the money that keeps palestine afloat

sorry didn mean that there was linked article in the second paragraph meant that the second paragraph of the above linked article addresses arguments about the horrors of meth use gt over the years have represented countless meth users have seen the consequences of meth use up close am convinced meth use will likely ruin the user life it is an extraordinarily dangerous addictive drug few drugs are more addictive or dangerous than meth many of those who oppose legalization of meth identify the horrors of meth use entirely agree with their assessment of meth dangers ll confess that didn read everything linked from that page but certainly read the whole article gt thought his argument was anything but convincing again wonder if we read the same article not trying to say that the convincing nature of his article should have convinced you you say legalization will make more addicts and he says it will make fewer his statement has whole argument attached to it and yours doesn understand if you don want to bring whole debate to reddit as the experience is usually lame gt it that by legalizing it you condone it and make it ok to try it you realize that there wouldn be any drug dealers if it were legal right so maybe more people would try it and get addicted but don think so by illegalizing it we ve pushed our prison population over two million already are you an expert on prison too
wow could it be that saddam hussein who was running iraq between gwi to gwii actually preffered to spend his oil money on other stuff instead of helping his people seem to remember some reports about un money going to the army instead of medications nah couldn be say hi to the boy in kindergarten tommorow you might end up best friends
since he is talking about prohibition those comparisons are very apt he does not compare the effects of meth to the effects of alcohol or marijuana he does compare the addictiveness to that of tobacco but again not the other effects

man the way that you guys believe saddam evidence of kuwait drilling his oil real smart move by kuwait btw and even claim its justification for attacking it just too good for words
the author seems kind of bitter he makes lots of emphatic assertions but uses less than excellent reasoning in my opinion also he also seems to be trying to reconcile the beliefs of all buddhists which like among all muslims christians hindus conflict trying to reconcile with reality the entirety of religion any religion is impossible because some of it is invariably wrong same goes for history and science as well
don know why bother but we invaded iraq for many reasons insisting that wmd was the only reason is willful ignorance with respect to wmd the intelligence services of many countries not just the us were convinced that saddam was still playing with wmd his own generals thought they had wmd being fooled or neglecting to detect deception and acting upon that false knowledge is not lying is it really so difficult to understand this if you base your entire argument against bush on this he lied theme what happens when we find out that wmd materials were sent to syria my point is that if you are anti bush it isn necessary to build your entire anti bush argument on the extremely weak foundation of he lied about wmd especially when there are plenty of other reasons to be unsatisfied with the administration even without wmd we would have been at war so if you want to argue against that course of action your argument has to take into account things other than wmd

invite you to read this wikipedia entry about the beginning of bin laden battle against usa http en wikipedia org wiki al qaeda actually it did begin with first gulf war but not for brotherhood with hussein as bin laden was ready to fight on the side of kuweit against iraq it was because saudi arabia welcomed us soldiers on his holy soil and forced bin laden into exile when he stand against that now concerning your last sentence of course we don have to obey terrorists but your has nothing to do with that if you got modded down it was certainly because you brought as reason for iraq war while there was no connection between iraqi regime and islamist organisations hussein was far from respectable man but he had nothing of an islamist

gt what trying to understand is what exactly caused it was it wrongful actions by the west or actions that did have justification yet annoyed extreme islam it covered pretty well and think quite fairly by the documentary the power of nightmares it long and interesting story but think one of the key facts to bear in mind is that al qaeda is direct offshoot of the mujahadeen who were pretty much set up by the us neocon element as part of their paranoid anti communist ideology so is very much case of chickens coming home to roost however think the clash of cultures is very much overplayed by both sides for their own reasons the main stated al qaeda grievance has always been the us controlling role in saudi and the middle east and following from that control of natural resources this is classically political terrorism is well rehearsed strategy for forcing political change although obviously it requires psychopathic level of ideological commitment so it would have been expected gt for example think gulf war was justified yes it surely annoyed fundamental muslims the thing is that saddam evidence for kuwaiti slant drilling came from the us who also gave him the nod to attack kuwait the islamists were anti saddam but the deaths of iraqis as result of that us manoeuvre would obviously be seen as an injustice and gulf war seen as further incursion into the middle east

gt mind brain if you are materialist then that not necessarily true though there are other nerve clusters in the body which play role if you believe in souls and that the brain and body are controlled via said incorporeal soul there still must exist an interface somewhere between the soul and the brain otherwise the soul mind could not control the physical body descartes thought it was in the pituitary gland if then the soul can control the brain then it must be empirically observable albeit indirectly if the soul is merely helpless observer which can even spark single neuron then all the parts of the brain that light up whenever we feel emotions or think about certain things or move muscle would have to be controlled entirely in the brain in which case what does the observer soul do does it even count as the same consciousness or being and why would we have one

gt mind brain that one view large amount of evidence suggests that the mind is something like an emergent property of the brain agree that reductionist thinking if we only knew all the details of the physical structure we understand thought is too limited however that not the same as claiming that minds exist as independent phenomena that are unconnected to brains the computer mind metaphor rahul raises elsewhere in this thread is somewhat interesting and rather old but isn terribly useful anyway if had to pick one method system of inquiry stick with science don mind being limited to observable phenomena say it debatable whether other phenomena matter

the stupidity of this idea is mind boggling the transport fuel tax is pretty much an economist wet dream at least as taxes go fair impartial proportional easily enforced and non intrusive user tax that you pay as you go not only that it encourages conservation oriented driving and car buying behavior and encourages driving smaller vehicles with less impact on roads they re looking at replacing it with an intrusive expensive difficult to enforce post payment tax in other words let figure out something even less popular than gas tax and push that which is probably their ulterior motive it makes raising gas taxes look like pretty good idea in comparison

whatever like tv for popular entertainment it beats the hell out of the alternatives there are about shows on right now that find better made more original and more compelling than what playing in the movie theaters and don even get me started on how much the music industry sucks right now like stories that play out over the course of years like the sopranos or six feet under they remind me of serialized novels from the enjoy several of the elaborate game shows they come up with nowadays and call reality tv happen not to watch the news on tv preferring to read my news on the internet but ve got no beef with people who do do have problem with those who assume all tv watchers are mindless victims of our evil capitalist system

don think the blogger is claiming that what she saying is that watching tv loads you down with preconcieved ideas from ads whether you are mindless or mindful consumer she also makes the point that tv distracts you from real work or really doing things both of which are points that most everyone who reads blogs knows she just putting it in personal terms to spur her readers to action rather than stale sociological discussion if tv is your drug of choice more power to you personally prefer posting on the internet
you mean that for materialist mind brain you might say that minds do not exist at all amp mdash for my part have the strong impression that have at least one of these things amp mdash but think nobody really claims that the term mind refers to the wet clump of biomass inside our skull in fact my point has nothing to do with the body soul question however admit that my above statement was misleading take for example mathematics mathematician creates axioms and concepts and investigates their implications using logic axioms concepts logic all these things are not observable in nature and therefore the method of empirical science is not applicable to them you can empirically study how the brain studies mathematics but this is something completely different than studying mathematics itself so mathematics is one of the the above mentioned territories that are inherently inaccessible to the scientific method http en wikipedia org wiki

eyewitness testimony despite being proven time and time again as horribly reliable determinant of guilt is accepted much more readily by most juries than facts in college had physics professor who was called upon by an attorney to testify to the impossibility of the defendent being the cause of an accident using well reasoned and scientifically sound explanation of how the accident could not have been the fault of the defendent the jury ruled for the plaintiff based on the eyewitness testimony of someone saying that they were sure of what they saw one witness vs science witness was more convincing
dave never said he didn address this issue said his interpretation of the issue in my opinion is wrong think he asking the wrong question and think he trying to use research albeit questionable about tobacco marijuana and alcohol to support the legalization of meth meth isn in the same league as these previously mentioned substances and it unwise and irresponsible to try and compare these substances with meth in my opinion it downright disingenuous

don think it fair to compare those other substances to meth in the first place but if he going to compare them the least he should do is address the differences in effects that my point he doesn even address the massive differences between the substances that he using to back up his argument you just helped me prove my point he so quick to use research about these other substances to back up his claims about meth but he doesn address the huge differences in effects of the substances we re not talking about apples to apples here and think it unfortunate that he tried to make that leap without providing all the details

gt no it does not that is quite stretch the form quite rightly xyz is trivially different from as is socially acceptable xyz suggest you consult dictionary http www com right gt see million people attempting to use force government for personal gain they are of course protesting the government proposals gt they wish to force other people employers to give them money unwillingly hardly you have to agree to comply with all sorts of regulations in order to be allowed to operate as an employer and quite rightly so stable predictable and safe employment is requirement for both social and business stability at large it another area where the libertarian anarchist model fails gt this is the very reason the term tyranny of the majority was coined no it refers to the oppression of minorities and forceful suppression of minority views not protesting changes in employment law
dude don watch tv read the newspaper or listen to the radio am still bombarded by histrionics from the current meth scare any vaguely informed person knows the difference between meth and marijuana don be absurd

the whole point of these demonstration is to get the government to withdraw law that was passed and that states that oyung employee can be hired by company and then for period of year can be fired at any time without reason or excuse you should come and work in france and see how difficult it is to fire somebody this law was meant for those without qualifications and without experience but demonstrators fera that this may be misused abused and generalized by business owners we ve seen previous examples of such abuses thinking about it it just doesnt make sense simply because if you re competent and good at what you do there is no reason for you to be fired since it would be an extra cost for the employer to retrain new person who will not be productive immediately the success of these demonstration can be explained by the fact that the french are now fed up with their governments for the past tear and te emploment maret is just rough especiall for the young unskilled workers but that france for you we re never happy and hate sudden and drastic changes especially when they are urgently needed

don need dictionary buddy speak english they re protesting against proposal to reduce the use of force by the government hence they desire that use of force you misunderstood me consider this warning sign that your mind doesn understand the economic ideas we re throwing around here stability is the antithesis of progress the people in these protests have the same mindset as the weavers who rioted against introduction of the automated jacquard loom business owners are minority
afraid that the obvious and unacceptable answer is right basically college admissions departments are looking for the wrong things in the article the author clearly stated that by qualified she meant leader president editor captain lead actress in every activity the question is does being perfect trophy child and joining all of the overachievers clubs make the kid better person and more likely to succeed in my opinion the answer is no when think to the overachievers knew in high school some have gone on to great things and some have barley managed to say in college the same can be said for the normal people and underachievers that knew
consider contracts as creating an irrevocable event in the future my statement then translates to it is immoral to force me to make contracts with others

in which case you will not qualify as an employer
valid and perfectly reasonable sentiment but think the more crucial part of the article is gt know this well at my own college these days we have three applicants for every one we can admit just three years ago it was two to one we can no doubt all agree that the community service president editor captain crap means next to nothing but the basic problem that admissions committies face is that they have to reduce pile of qualified deserving candidates into much smaller pile in other words the problem isn one that can be solved at the admissions committie the problem is the pigeonhole principle

this article is absolutely bunk maybe at kenyon college has anyone else ever heard of it or previously all girls colleges are scrambling for men but elsewhere it becoming more difficult for men to go to college as result of biased admissions officers ignoring merit and an increasing number of scholarships availble only to women for example mit admission rate for men is while for women it is ucberkeley department of engineering has similar statistics while true that uncompetitive colleges such as kenyon may have surplus of male applicants competitive colleges such as berkeley engineering mit stanford yale harvard princeton and other ivy ivy calibre schools do not favor men the nytimes piece is nothing short of misleading
is this is reason why women are generally more intimate to their children than men

personally hate all of this fuzzy admission stuff seems like there great potential for unfairness thanks to the internet sure could write credible essay professing my love for botany poetry ancient hebrew all of which know nothing about here in ireland the admissions process is as follows do an average of high school subjects sit final country wide exam in each subject add up percentages for your top subjects total computer awards you college university place based on your score out of the computer doesn know if you are male female young old great at sports ran the student council or even what school you are coming from it doesn care there are no scholarships here either some exceptional students might get grants but they still have to go through the same admissions process as everybody else now that system may not seem fair either but at least it puts the emphasis on academic performance

not bad system do you have choice of degree courses or is that also selected for you by the computer depending on your subjects taken aggregated scores etc
an extensible ed are you crazy man
sorry should have been clearer you can pick up to degree courses in order of preference from different colleges some courses have additional entry requirments for example degree in french might require that you studied french in high school and scored at least degree in mathematics will possibly require in mathematics at the high school level the computer only selects courses from your list in order of preference every year the dept of education publish the minimum and median scores of the people who were admitted to that course in the previous year so you can decide how attainable course is and adjust your studying accordingly some courses may only require around points so you can decide to not work as hard at certain subject just make sure that out of subjects you can get over combined there lot less disappointment that way there is only one application form to fill out and there is only one notification for the courses you have been offered we have the option to do all this over the internet too which is very handy

against the war but found the article had very good point the problem is at this point there appears to be no carrot no reason for insurgents not to use violence and of course that this civil war was started by third party meddling is reprehensible but it too late for that which must admit is slowly making me nuts all the things that could have made it better that it now too late for it not too late to impeach bush and thereby reduce the chances of similar mistakes in the future sure wolfowitz at the world bank and bolton at the un won help and alita and roberts and but you ve got to start somewhere

comrades throw off the shackles of your decadent interfaces gnome curses backspace we should not need them all this could be directly integrated with the shell you could have an active file and then another list of files which you could swap around between can think of lots of neat features that aren really practical in full screen editors you could tail log files and reliably edit text at the same time using such strategy in the same session you could do things like say put stuff that comes through between now and me typing in the current buffer through to the clipboard you could apply different ascii markup of prepanded text to different streams to differentiate them it would probably become quick hacky way to script bits of lisp together as well it could be extended to do email as for web browsing maybe not so easy you want shell editing mode supporting the usage as well set whatever guess it would be most easily implemented within emacs but it would be nice if someone would come up with something thinner

of course you can put the origin of your coordiante system wherever you want and work out the physical equations from there what galileo found was that the equations of the solar system get dramatically simpler when you put the origin of your coordinate system into the sun instead of on the earth if you are appalled by the idea that man should sacrifice his central place in universe for some simplified equations well that perfectly legitimate if you have to actually do computations concerning the solar system you ll probably be very happy about galileo insight but please don take the bible as scientific text the simplest argument there are many against this reading is if the bible was meant to be read as scientific text at least the most obvious contracdictions would have been corrected but until very recently last century or so readers were aware that the bible tells stories about humans their lifes and their god you are expected to use your brain your personal context your historical knowledge to make sense of these stories if you are looking for text to be read literally go read the manual of your washing machine

gt some exceptional students might get grants but they still have to go through the same admissions process as everybody else unfortunately this is set to change this year universities in ireland may actually ignore the points requirements if they like dcu have begun making exceptions for elite athletes with ucd set to follow from the irish times http www ireland com newspaper sport sp gaatwo html subscription gt dublin city university has opened all of its degree courses to direct entry by elite athletes it means that applicants with strong sporting background will be able to secure entry without satisfying the full academic points requirements ironically the current irish university entrance system is set to be overhauled in the next few years to make it more fuzzy as so many have complained that assigning university places based on single set of examinations is unfair judging by this article the alternative seems even worse

the only circumstance in which would agree with granting direct entry to elite athletes is degree relating to sports performance metric currently not measured in our system wouldn allow it for any other degree for which suitability can be measured reasonably well using the existing system if they didn work hard enough academically to get into college through standard means what makes the faculty think they will once they get accepted the only reason can think of is to improve the school sporting reputation thankfully done with all that now but wonder if kids in the near future will end up doing classes for extra credit or taking meaningless extra curricular activities to improve their chances of getting college place if they make the final exams incorporate substantial amount of continuous assesment then be all for it but they should leave the admissions alone think it fair enough as it is

think hxa had it right commercial power it doesn matter what the populace thinks manifest destiny nobility civilisation or whatever the government will do as it sees fit the government is most influenced by those with money and those with money want to at worst keep their money and at best grow it indefinitely also think of it this way the american populace is used to certain lifestyle one which costs hell of lot of money when compared with most countries now how can any us government turn to its populace and say sorry folks the game up we ve been living on borrowed money for too long we re reliant on imports and we can sell enough shit back to pay for it the only way out is to either cut down drastically on hugely wasteful lives or to invade resource rich nations so that you control them or the puppets you put there are happy to co operate with you not wishing to improve your life acquire more money more goods and cutting back won happen it would feel like betrayal of the american dream

use both python and ruby they are very similar yet very different if you want true power and flexibility then you must use ruby if you want limited power and rigidity then you must use python ruby elegance is its flexibility it derives power from this python would be elegant were it not so rigid and cold and named after slimy snake
was being sarcastic
the phrases at the bottom are hillarious you ve done enough damage please don hit reload looks like we shouldn have stopped using lisp you know what they say you get what you pay for
what find interesting is this gt remove macros expression aren these two features considered by most people to be what gives lisp such power
doubt five years is always the correct number but the timeline makes sense for some things would say it applies more towards development tools and user interface methods than anything else

this plan sounds great in theory but it wouldn work in progress it based on the assumption that politicians are incorruptible by removing the huge tangle of bureaucracy you remove the politician power which is to grant or deny subsidies monopolies social programs etc based on lobbyists and dependent voters and so you can count on every polician who would lose power due to this plan to fight it tooth and nail it would need huge amount of public support now that by itself doesn make it unworkable the problem is that we ll never be able to keep all the bureacracy from creeping back in it would start with the agency in charge of distributing the money and just grow and grow over time then again maybe just being naysayer hell vote for anyone who supported this

interesting reading for conservative leaning like myself was pretty uniformed about this and as read green revolution was bracing for another one of those articles suffice it to say it was pretty satisfying to read what he had to say about erlich in particular beyond what he had to say the kindness and class with which he leveled his criticisms are some things in which could use lesson
in emacs cperl mode which catches it instantly if forget bracket or semicolon or whatever by indenting it differently than expect estimate have saved myself approximately one bazillion hours of painful debugging because emacs groks perl syntax well enough to make me notice my errors instantly nothing against vi but to the best of my knowledge it doesn do that
and his point is that the big editing feature of emacs is that it is extensible want your editor to support perl python lisp php html tex whatever find the file to download or code it up yourself don like the way that it adds those options you can modify it probably without even changing the plugin file which makes your changes portable emacs big advantage is that it is an environment that can be customized to your needs almost any editing feature can be recreated in emacs if you want it

indeed think anyone to whom wsj editors would allow space would know that whatever suggestions he makes probably wouldn be implemented anytime soon due to the idiotic nature of the human obstacles but think it important to get the ideas out there and talked about first in addition to getting chewed over in public debate the idea and its tangents take root in the minds of individuals pretty soon it makes sense to agitate congress about it unfortunately yet quite predictably congress is the last stop on the line of new ideas
if you want those liberal credentials it actually bit trickier than you imagine to get them you would be forced to become person who thinks about things reflectively rather than going about parroting the views of your favorite pundits to start instead of pulling out the least nuanced most ignorant knee jerk rabidly partisan response possible assume to try to win some imaginary points for your side you should actually try to critically read the link and consider it honestly and to be good liberal you would need to consider it in light of other writings and acknowledge that it may or may not be true based on critical reading and how well it coheres with your education and not on the basis of whose side you imagine the writer is on what wins you those credentials is lots of education and critical reading in the process most learned people will discover very remarkable thing human efforts towards progress regularly have unintended consequences in earning your credentials you would recognize that the benefits of the green revolution came at some cost and learning to have nuanced view you might perhaps judge that it was worth that cost perhaps not and you would back your position up with arguments using critical reasoning skills and citing that stuff you spent time reading as it is you clearly have no liberal credentials since your post is mix of monumental ignorance clear illustration that you did not read let alone analyze the argument the author contributed and slew of logical fallacies posts of that sort might earn you conservative credentials and they are certainly easier to do but they add nothing to discussion nor do they help anyone in trying to understand the issues at hand since the original post was deleted here is the link that was in question http www harpers org theoilweeat html

found the shape of earth opinions differ http pkarchive org column html tone of this article very disturbing yeah you can define the earth as stationary and non rotating but it seriously screws up describing the motion of anything else and expect you probably end up requiring some distant bodies to be travelling faster than light to account for their observed motion but hey if he willing to multiply his hypotheses enough to ascribe foucault pendulum to mystery force then why not throw out the last century of physics too gt if you see the earth as just humdrum planet among stars circling in vast universe then we re not significant we re just part of crowd sungenis said but if you believe everything revolves around earth it gives another picture of purpose meaning of life that says it all he taking as first principle that we re privileged observers an inherently anti scientific premise evidently because he uncomfortable with finding meaning in life without that principle it no wonder that no one won his prize for proving heliocentrism nothing can convince true believer

well sort of the principle of using sound to alter brainwaves is solid and proven but since we are all individuals the best results you will get if the wavefrequences are adjusted to each individual as well the adjustment experiment was done couple of years back if my memory serves me correctly by some german scientists what they found was that the best way to find the correct frequencies are just to simply record the persons own brainwaves
would say you learn about good code by reading code period good code shows you how things should be done bad code shows you how they shouldn using your brain while reading it helps to understand when you are creating examples of either in reality you are not going to learn much about writing code sitting here reading articles from reddit go write code go clean up your old code go work with existing code that is how you learn to do it trying to learn how to write good code by reading articles is like trying to learn to drive by reading road signs
the difference may largely be in differing adhd occurrence about times as many boys as girls http www org tables htm are diagnosed with adhd every year most schools are structured in way that serves non adhders better thus on average schools are serving girls better than boys this is assuming the diagnoses are not biased by sexism which is big assumption
well the point is sungenis reasoning all comes down to the following premise gt science is full of things that cannot be proven gt and in the absence of proof the bible has answers seriously this man freaking genius the premise is so simple and elegant that no average joe is willing or able to object to it what funny is that actually the main objection would be just as simple and elegant all we have do is to confront him with the exact opposite statement the bible is full of things that cannot be proven and in the absence of proof science has answers would love to hear what he replies to that
physicists don have much to worry about from people this far gone think even the idists will want to distance themselves from people like robert sungenis if not then perhaps eventually things like aeroplanes will be designed by robert sungenis and his ilk based on whatever physics they agree with

yes but for long time the list of what separated lisp from mainstream languages was much longer first class functions anonymous functions closures garbage collection dynamic typing symbols ruby has all of these and access to something lot like expressions through the ast think someone who knows the language better than do could make convincing argument for ruby being lisp dialect with expressions http en wikipedia org wiki expression

has anyone checked out that fixedearth website that was linked in the story it either one big joke or the most frightening thing have ever seen
the last line in the wikipedia article you linked somewhat touches on why ruby isn really lisp dialect with expressions gt several other languages such as dylan and python borrow heavily from lisp but use an algol like syntax that differs from both expressions and expressions expressions are still somewhat different from the algol syntax in ruby and python
not talking about language support emacs has support for all those languages you listed talking about lisp inside emacs emcas is development environment it guts are accessable by user who wants to change them the tool to change emacs is lisp what does vi have comparable to that

anyone can think about things reflectively conservative or otherwise all people are endowed with reason conservative and liberal are just labels for tendencies that people have in the way they tend to think about things and approach issues the ideal of liberal is one who is freed from cultural prejudices and traditions so they are willing to consider the fundamental problems we face in themselves trusting that human reason has the ability to understand these things and come up with solutions they are liberated from the binds of inherited culture which is the root of the word liberalism is anti dogmatic there are those who might call themselves liberal but who just parrot their favorite heroes without much understanding those people are not especially liberal historically conservative was someone did not trust human reason as adequate to understand the root of the problems we face which was why they upheld holding to inherited cultural traditions and opposed change even if there appeared to be good account for doing so they conserve their culture which is the root of the word an argument could be made for this position but it isn what modern conservatism is about can honestly tell what conservative is these days note that the positions you attribute to me are not at all what said which shows lack of critical reading skills

methods like each take block special syntactic construct which is sort of cross between and lisp lambdas they re not exactly anonymous functions since they re not first class values you can say my_variable still they cover most of the cases where lambdas would be used and in more friendly syntax learnt functional programming before learnt ruby but now the wrapping lambda feels unnecessary

think what he meant was that continuations are special feature of scheme unlike the others listed above which are common to all dialects and implementations of lisp also what heard was that lisp refers to an essential core of features as explained by pg in the roots of lisp http www paulgraham com rootsoflisp html and family of languages sharing this core including common lisp and scheme so scheme is lisp lots of confusion ensues though when people confuse lisp in general with common lisp in particular

in ruby blocks are syntactic structures that are part of the syntax of method call receiver method arg arg block code if you want to capture block for later use you can call lambda as in lambda the block so lambda is method call with an implicit receiver of self and zero arguments its return value is an instance of the proc class core class provided by the language the block is captured within the proc instance and can be called via the proc object call arguments can be passed also to blocks that expect them call there has been some experimentation with the parser to allow proc objects to be implicitly created from the block syntax add experimental lambda that adds its two arguments finally there are some alternative ways to create proc objects proc new the block proc the block proc objects created in this way have slightly different semantics from procs created via lambda that don want to go into here
expressions were mccarthy attempt at an algol like syntax for lisp if you want to be strict about it then anything that doesn use mccarthy original unfinished expression syntax doesn count not being so strict things that gets turned in to something like expressions and executed are expressions ruby uses duck typing so using it when discussing ruby syntax

gt the arguments he lists are the oldest in the book yes of course and easily countered by apologists religion as practised by its theologians is subtle nuanced and buttressed against many of the obvious disputes however the average believer is no theologian the average christian doesn pray to god to understand his will the average christian prays to god for his team to win the football game and because the average belief is so unconsidered and simplistic the oldest bluntest arguments can destroy it in debate and if puff of air topples one simplistic faith revealing to him the soft foundations it perched on how inclined do you think he will be to find worth in faith anymore he doesn know he could lay down much stronger foundations and rebuild he will think the whole business is sham

hi
leo and the moon are like the north pole it was very important to go there once to prove what man was capable of terrific accomplishment and trophy for humanity did the public cry after the first trip to the north pole when it was announced that we would not be sending constant trips up there did they say it was step backwards in our polar exploration no sure we take trip north every now and then when the cost benefit ratio is good and we have lots of unmanned scientific equipment there but we all be pretty pissed if the government were spending million to fund an expedition there merely in the name of vague exploration or if billions were being spent to set up an international arctic base it also interesting that private companies occasionally send cruises to the poles space should be like that again my main point here we can stop sending people into space and it not anything to be ashamed about
lots of words no real meaning the statement that only companies who understand open source moved into the economy of the st century is bunk as is the statement that google has been the engine which has fueled the new international economy not to denegrate google but come on gain some perspective here not to mention the political blinkers of the author anyone who thinks fox news and the nation form equivalent idealogical poles needs to get out more in the end this is an article trying to say something important but loses itself so thoroughly on the way that it ends up stuck somewhere between platitude and hyperbole

grassfire org sent out an alarmist email acting like specter bill would benefit terrorists as sen kennedy described the people who would benefit from the legislation he said they are our neighbors churchgoers the shop owners down the street they are the people we know apparently sen kennedy didn consult with grassfire own ron de jong whose parents following morning raid just few feet from their home discovered that their illegal alien neighbors weren the shop owners or churchgoers that kennedy described but rather wanted members of the terrorist gang ms when in fact it takes years you need steady job clean record and to pay fines in order to qualify for citizenship hate grassfire

as utah resident my email to the election commission dear elections division this email has been copied to lt governor gary herbert and governor jon huntsman jr am appalled at an article that was in the salt lake tribune yesterday march th http www sltrib com ci_ entitled new vote machines ignite feud in emery the story is that the emery county clerk had concerns that there was possibly some hidden software on these diebold voting machines that apparently haven had any independent review hence he had them independently reviewed which caused diebold and lt governor gary herbert to become upset it shocking that the state of utah would spend million to purchase new voting machines from company that doesn allow anyone to independently review the fairness and accuracy of the machines registered republican and the precinct chair as have been for years but am very concerned about the impartiality of any company that isn independantly reviewed in fact in gop fundraising letter dated aug diebold ceo walden dell openly declared he was committed to helping ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president bush next year that at the very least should make independent reviews of their voting products necessity if not completely compromising their claims to voting fairness it completely understandable that third party looking at voting machines could possibly compromise them depending on how they are designed but if someone looking at the machines can cause them to be compromised then how on earth can you put them in voting booths when hundreds of people will have physical access to them in private setting the very idea that the machines can be inspected by third party shows just how fragile these systems apparently are why hasn diebold designed hardwired electronic circuit or mechanical system with failsafes such that the machines can be hacked and the wrong candidate will not be selected if the machine fails if the machines can be verified as uncompromised on voting day by an election staffer at voting location multiple times throughout the day that huge problem for the voting commission to accept diebold line that that the way it is is simply unacceptable slot machines in nevada can be checked against any number of parameters to make sure that hardware has not been added or replaced the software has not been altered from the registered version on file with the ngc and the settings for the software match the casino payout statements the casino can do these checks the ngc can do these checks interested public parties can do these checks with the cooperation of either the casino or the ngc shouldn we expect at least as much from the recordkeepers of democracy as we expect from gambling house your response will be appreciated best regards lt signed gt

bullshit don know whether the rally was really as wholesome as the author claims maybe it was but if the council perceives it as intentionally baiting the council has the right to condemn it regardless of whether that stupidly playing into the rally organizer hands the council doesn have the right to condemn it for its religious conent but the author isn even claiming that that what the council did this just isn legit st amendment issue unless there more to it that the author didn bother to write about
lt quote gt there are countless people in academia in the usa and at nasa who have noted how indians compulsively exchange favors constantly promoting their cliques at the expense of others lt quote gt any references you care to share with us and you surely don believe those dimwitted mails gloryfing indians celebrating the invention of zero and the high percentage of indians at nasa which is quite untrue clique formation can only work if the inefficiences inherent to nepotism can be covered up by socialistic set up do you really believe that you can go about hiring indians jews covertly or overtly simply on the basis of their race or origin without facing the heat from more objectively meritorious competition and while you are at it you should also start including armenians austrians asians and other talented immigrant pools because they behave the same way you might also want to look up what sample bias means with every tom dick and hari getting on the net these days you can very easily find suitably illiterate subset to butress whatever specious argument you embrace for instance http www google com search holocaust hoax
gt signing contract is choice well yes you would think so however tronxd seems to think that making bosses stick to their employment contracts is some kind of oppression as though they were forced at gunpoint to set up companies and employ people just pointing out that becoming an employer is also free choice and that choosing it carries certain such as signing an employment contract paying taxes and pensions paying maternity leave making sure the workplace is safe etc think it clear to anyone who has read this sorry thread that your claim of obtuseness is misdirected

einstein theory applies only to inertial reference frames those that are not accelerating revolution around the sun entails acceleration not necessarily in the common sense of speeding up but in the sense of any change in speed or direction so no you can set the earth at the center and work from there of course in its own way it just as wrong to set the sun at the center of the universe it not an inertial reference frame either because it revolving around the center of the galaxy but if you re just modeling the solar system then the sun is the only place to put the center if you want your model to make any sense at all this guy should have flunked freshman year physics

developer professionally used emacs for about years including using vm for email and writing fair bit of elisp including my own major and minor modes was right into it until my hands started to hurt then switched to vim reluctantly at first since found it hard to do even simple stuff like running make my hands stopped hurting though because didn have to twist my thumb to hit and because didn have to use the ctrl key so much which have next to doesn matter now can use emacs it too primitive the number one editing feature that vi has that emacs doesn is modal editing viper doesn count it not good as vim and just degrades from emacs modes are where it at and wish more people realised this can use xcode or other popular editors since even with super duper key mapping you can emulate vi modes like other commenters here really would like to see an editor with simplicity of lisp based runtime with the vi modal paradigm maybe with yzis http www yzis org it would be possible
your point is excellent the main difference between the north pole and outer space is that we have pipe dream of conquering and terraforming space to give us more space to live after all decades of science fiction have taught us that this is the only way to solve overpopulation if nasa ended the space program permanently people would have to recognize that at least in the st century this is nothing more than dream and sending even single person into orbit right now costs way more than any possible benefit we could get from it
don think the primary concern should really be the voided warranty or the measly it costs to reset the machines neuquino comments about slot machine validation by the nevada gaming commission casinos and the public are right on target there is public interest in ensuring that voting machines work properly obvious therefore there must be some way of checking the integrity of the machines without taking anyone word for it apparently this is not obvious somehow

tend to be really conservative about education my own feeling is that very strong reading skills can make kids think independently faster as they can learn for themselves more readily don think it takes lot of money to get strong readers use lot of poetry with the people tutor to get them to read more slowly focus better on the text and think through each thing said the poetry that use of course emily dickinson shakespeare yeats is all available free online granted this doesn work for everyone and excluding math science education sports the costs of running school the costs of bringing quality talent in etc but year and kids learning nothing is disgrace someone getting away with quite bit in those failing systems money is no substitute for discipline patience and dedicated learned teachers

amused at how ruby and python zealots fight for attribute lispy as if king was dead still dont understand why they just dont use lisp but can think of few killer reasons why lisp may be hinderance amp it has nothing to do with the language hardware usage it has more to do with development tools amp integration to the stack db webserver and speed of development for average programmers cli non visual tools lots of code generation this may not be problem to some who want to invest time in learning how to do this but for those looking for faster way code monkeys to genereate apps lisp may fall short compared to say rails faster can mean more due to lower development costs so in short its possible the commercial imperative may dictate lisps choice more than mere technical reasons when it comes to reducing costs creating product faster generating more does not imply better product simply more commercial one

also stopped taking cable and am so much better off can probably help answer the question of why tv is worse than movies and music at least in my case time benefit unless you are strict tivoer apart from the really good shows you end up watching lot of junk programming that you were never interested in the first place with movies only watch movies that have heard are really good and have subject matter that may interest me similarly with music can rely on other people reviews or at worst spend minutes to hear the song also music can be relegated to more of background activity and hence not take up all your attention you can carry your music around with media player and do greater range activities monetary benefit if you are strict tivoer evaluate how many shows in year do you really end up watching that you are really interested in in my case it was not more than of them can always rent the season dvds on netflix when the release which is far far cheaper than paying month for cable with music and movies spend money only on stuff that might enjoy and thanks to itunes dont buy an entire album to get single song anymore in my case have been able to read so many books ever since stopped watching cable tv do watch lot of movies through netflix but never more than movie day when was watching tv used to end up spending close to hours every day nearly watching tv nearly half of which was stuff didn really want to watch that said don agree completely with the original article agree that tv does have some interesting programming it definitely has entertainment value do miss the occassional documentary and weekly programs on public television on discovery etc but cable tv requires tremendous management and control to not waste time that could have been spent doing something else also it is way too expensive to justify the entertainment that it provides

that pretty good explanation didn know that lambda syntax was possible that pretty neat but here the fundamental thing not understanding why are blocks special syntax for method calls why not make block arguments equivalent to other arguments and just allow the syntax to create closure isn that much neater for example with the existing syntax it bit funky to pass two blocks into function if you so desire one block would have to be the block while another one would be passed in using the lambda syntax unless misunderstand ruby don actually know the language hehe that seems bit unclean
no no this analysis is itself crock of manure these sorts of analyses are so difficult to do because of all the confounding factors whoever published these numbers wasn even trying have you heard for example that the district of columbia is one of the most violent drug ridden places in the entire nation do you think that might make the job of education at any given expenditure level harder do you think that lot of the money spent might go to caring for physically and mentally handicapped victims of drug abuse do you have any idea how expensive that is longitudinal time based studies are also hard to do because conditions in community change over time yet here in oregon can certainly show you what happened to education in otherwise fairly stable communities when we drastically decreased in constant dollars per pupil educational expenditures it not pretty

yes it was sarcastic
first the nyt seriously distorted the testimony then jbstjohn seriously distorted the nyt story by concocting false headline the reddit posting has no connection to reality go read the source chairman specter think the thrust of what you are saying is the president is bound by statute like everyone else unless it impinges on his constitutional authority and statute cannot take away the president constitutional authority anybody disagree with that no response chairman specter everybody agrees with that

if it so obvious then why didn they declare it illegal or do you have your sarcasm switched on agree that the position the nyt pundit reporter is taking
as have consisted performed my duties and even more letters like this should be proofread hundred times to be free of any errors nevertheless funny shit
there are two steps that need to be taken the first is to create fine for employing an illegal the fine should be on the order of or of the business gross revenue for the previous year whichever is less per each illegal employee the funds collected from enforcing this law would be used only to fund further enforcement as result the jobs would dry up almost immediately and million illegals would deport themselves no wall needed no border patrol with the almost certain violence that will go along with it simultaneously the us and mexico would work on equalizing their minimum wages right now the us minimum wage is nine times the mexican minimum which is ridiculous unskilled labor is unskilled labor and an imaginary line shouldn make any difference at all once the difference in minimum wage is for example only two times then the incentive to leave mexico and come north would be greatly reduced these can be the only possible solutions so if it is so obviously feasible why isn the us government doing something about it remember how they wanted national biometric id using the excuse of fighting the war on terror but people wouldn go for it well people are about ready to go for it to get rid of illegals by the way april tax day this year will be day without an american day everyone who wants to protest our government policy is to stay home from work if there is not sufficient reaction from washington it will be escalated into continuous series of and then day weekends also this coming monday april at noon local time everyone who wants to protest needs to go to their senator local office to make their views known

david weale taught history at upei for years he retired last year but decided to teach one last class history of christianity this year up to hundred students signed up for the subject because the name david weale has spread through his books and his lectures there was standing room only in his classes because professor weale can keep his students spellbound for two or three hours without looking at note professor weale took let us say somewhat controversial measure to cut down class size can you imagine high school teacher with class of students he promised the overflow passing grade if they did not attend classes in my opinion david weale was trying to create workable environment for himself and the students the administration of upei did not see it that way and suspended professor weale he apologized but to no avail after years of teaching he was sent down the steps his class gathered petition to support their professor but in the meantime prank anti muslim cartoon appeared in the student newspaper and with the press getting hold of that david weale case was swept under the carpet was professor weale view on class size really that far off the mark think it is shame that the story ended this way it was black day and big loss for our great university and for certainly hope that this episode does not silence the voice of david weale
david weale made mistake but it was to make point which has not been adequately addressed by the upei president regarding large classes and lowering standards surely debate of these issues is appropriate david weale has been extraordinarily successful in helping islanders young and old understand their roots what other professor at upei has had such profound effect on so many students don think that david weale or in broad sense all of we islanders who remember them times have been shown the respect which is our due president wade maclauchlan has chosen to put permanent black mark on career that is far larger than single incident or university president who seems to be making an example of what happens to people with whom he does not agree

it hard to be theoretical physicist for number of reasons you have to be quite smart that is to succeed you ll need to be able to hold multiple large ideas in your head and fit them together like puzzle pieces if you were exposed to mathematics as kid and have natural aptitude then maybe you can handle it without having to give up everything else in your life in favor of studying not all professors understand what they re supposed to be teaching and not all of them can actually teach for lower level classes this isn usually problem since you can ask around and find other prof to help you when there only condensed matter guy in the department and he of no help you end up spending lot of time in the library banging your head against the wall as professional theoretical physicist guessing you spend an inordinate amount of time trying to convince large organizations to continue funding your work learning theoretical physics through self study is what you do when you study this stuff at university it almost all self study except for those crucial times where you really don get it and some sharp teacher asks you just the right question to help you understand

agree when it comes to totalitarianism it doesn matter what party left or right could even imagine the libertarian party becoming totalitarian given enough time and the right circumstances granted that would be going exactly against their stated principles but principles are not people and government is corrupting influence on everyone politicians should never ever ever be trusted even if you agree completely with what they say always assume they re saying what they say because they want more power it like the basic safety strategy of always assuming that gun is loaded

while interesting the premise that dukkha did not originally mean dissatisfaction frustration suffering or something akin is surprising from what recall reading the dhammapada and other sections of the pali canon which are the earliest texts we have that sense of dukkha was already there as meaning something like suffering dissatisfaction guess will revisit them to see how well my old assumptions hold this article is definitely one of those cases where one needs to have the book in hand to see the citations to get feel for how well the argument holds up googled some other things by david brazier and he definitely does hold positions that are far outside the mainstream that not to say he wrong but it does account for why the premises of the book seems flat out weird here another review of the same book that sheds more light http www deepstreams org journal atikenreview htm

never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by webmaster error he claims to have sent the pics to his webmaster and that the webmaster made the mistake the only reason tend to believe him is that provided he was actually in iraq don know if he was lying about that part he could have taken picture of busy street that gave the impression of stability ignoring the fact that any single photo tells nothing about the general state of iraq the fact that kaloogian thinks that putting photo on website as evidence of well anything gives one the impression that he either not the brightest bulb or that he playing to his base

partially retract my previous statement about ruby anonymous function syntax being less scary than others scary isn really the right term but it is less straightforward than scheme cl or apparently erlang the reason is that this doesn work def foo but this does lambda won get in to the lisp lisp holy war other than to define it this obviously applies to number of non lisp languages now lisp makes no distinction between names for functions variables or any other first class objects scheme python and arc are this way lisp has separate namespaces for regular variables defined functions and sometimes other kind of objects there special way to refer to the name of function when passing it as an argument instead of calling it and separate way to call functions that are stored in regular variables cl and ruby are this way an example for clarity here variable being set to an anonymous function in scheme define foo lambda which is identical in effect to define foo in both cases you can call foo in the usual way foo gt in common lisp it different defparameter foo lambda gives you symbol foo that points to function but it must be called like this funcall foo gt both sides think their way is clearer know ve seen this verified but only going to look it up if someone asks me to

exactly or for the joel fans out there predictions of the redmond company demise are to say the least premature microsoft has an incredible amount of cash money in the bank and is still incredibly profitable it has long way to fall it could do everything wrong for decade before it started to be in remote danger and you never know they could reinvent themselves as shaved ice company at the last minute so don be so quick to write them off in the early everyone thought ibm was completely over mainframes were history back then robert cringely predicted that the era of the mainframe would end on january when all the applications written in cobol would seize up and rather than fix those applications for which allegedly the source code had long since been lost everybody would rewrite those applications for client server platforms well guess what mainframes are still with us nothing happened on january and ibm reinvented itself as big ol technology consulting company that also happens to make cheap plastic telephones so extrapolating from few data points to the theory that microsoft is finished is really quite severe exaggeration http www joelonsoftware com articles apiwar html

well you apparently don know your armenian history very well take gander the point is even after he was first accused he defended the photo surely he looked at them to make sure it was only after he was caught red handed that he changed his story even forgetting his heritage the metadata on the picture on the boingboing link shows it was taken in july of which is when he also toured iraq unless the anonymous webmaster substituted someone else photo which curiously coincides with the date of the iraq trip it was probably submitted by kaloogian who ought to have known so sorry but it is evidence of something to be sure either incompetence on kaloogian part or simple lying but then if it were incompetence why would he defend the picture if he seen it you can pin this on the webmaster
that strategy works great for speeding tickets too the next time you get one just go to court and tell them that there are thousands and thousands of other cars on the road speeding and sure they ll waive your fine

so much in agreement with most of your comment that this little bit knocked me off kilter gt be more concerned if there were gap among the average iq of different races after adjusting for level of education socioeconomic background hell even current amounts of sleep and what they had for breakfast this morning how on earth do you adjust for level of education or socioeconomic background sounds to me like pretty weaselly way to do research like pick the outcome you want to see and then adjust accordingly

national income proposals aren new idea the real problem with the idea is probably moral hazard how many people would decide just to live on the national income instead of working creating large number of long term unemployed is bad partly because of the costs to tax revenues and the economy but mostly because it tends to generate welfare underclasses which people find very hard to leave even if they want to hence the clinton welfare reforms which moved in the opposite direction and have been considered successful at weakening the welfare trap in the us it probably also not good politically to have large proportion of voters who depend on the government for their income net welfare recipients instead of having the government depend on them for its income net taxpayers see juvenal on bread and circuses that the argument anyway mickey kaus http www kausfiles com makes it eloquently don claim to know much about the subject of welfare reform myself except that fairly sure there aren many easy answers

part of the problem is that people don like to hear real truth why do blacks have genetic advantage in physical activities the same reason that blacks on average have lower iq than whites at least in the us slave culture when white slave owners bought and bred slaves they treated them like livestock as with livestock you breed for strength and physical stamina not intelligence harsh you bet but that doesn make it less true nor is it racist it more annoying that every time someone tries to understand something about culture using compare and contrast methods they are attacked by social convention and ignorance people should ask hard questions and not be afraid of the ugly answers lt end rant gt

someone talking about why it was so hard to pick up advanced math without the help of classroom environment said that there was narrative behind each theorem every theorem is telling the story of problem here the catch you have to know the problem and understand why people bother thinking about it the teacher focuses on explaining what the problem is and why it important while the book just focuses on how to solve the problem

judging from the march of the points on this one bush supporters have no sense of humor remember this is man who cannot stay on segway and who actually managed to run into stationary policeman while riding bike in scotland after this picture was taken the canadian prime minister graciously commented that those steps were not built for big guys like them of course it doesn help that the only big guys in the picture are actually fox and himself who seem to have no trouble
dorky pseudo mathematical logic there are better more interesting posts on similar topics out there
the first arent anything new but the rest of them are quite ineresting facts
the danish cartoon controversy just won go away it is one of those issues that people have opinions about without seeing the critical evidence the cartoons in question islanders might have been accorded the opportunity to see them in the upei newspaper if the student council likely abetted and encouraged by the university administration hadn sent in the campus police to seize and confiscate the issue containing the cartoons the confiscation more than the publication put upei back on the front pages and on the national television newscasts while the upei newspaper was the first in canada to publish the cartoons that in itself would have only rated one or two line story in the national media but the act of censorship that followed made it bigger deal
the point ve seen made is that court can really meaningfully comment on its own legality this empowerment has to come from outside in this case congress since congress has the responsibility of oversight of the executive branch and they passed the fisa law explicitly to deal with domestic spying all the judges can do is draw attention to this when judge from this court says the president is bound to the law like everyone else and the president ignores it at the president peril and the president says he has broken or gone around or worked against or ignored or what have you this law think that about as close as you can come to calling something illegal given that their hasn been trial nor have the full details been revealed confession isn conviction after all

truly unbelievable if understanding the content of amazon letters to this person it is unacceptable when reviewing non fiction book to express your opinion about the content or critique the subject matter of the book what does that leave spelling and grammar combined with the fact that they don touch positive reviews that violate this stated policy it looks very much to me like they are deliberately gaming their own customer review system in order to boost sales this is not only dishonest and unethical but may very well be fraudulent ve been an amazon customer for long time that may change now there are number of good alternatives out there such as powell http www powells com
why is this still reddit needs some way of combining top with new in some clever weighted approach
mustachioed band of misfits that rule their world and yours too
um no quoting from the link quote of the transcript tno am talking about fisa and is president bound by the rules and regulations of fisa tjudge baker if it is held constitutional and it is passed suppose just like everyone else he is under the law too tsenator feinstein judge tjudge stafford everyone is bound by the law but do not believe with all due respect that even an act of congress can limit the president power under the necessary and proper clause under the constitution tchairman specter think the thrust of what you are saying is the president is bound by statute like everyone else unless it impinges on his constitutional authority and statute cannot take away the president constitutional authority anybody disagree with that since the law was passed back in the because of another republican president abusing his powers and has been used since that time it is presumably passed and held constitutional am unfamiliar with the necessary and proper clause however apparently in ww real war against countries and not abstract nouns when truman tried to appropriate steel mills the courts ruled his action and there it wasn the case that law had been enacted specifically to regulate executive prerogative for the record think if take the washington times view of things run by sun yung moon isn it over the new york times which makes some big mistakes too believe you ve already admitted you don care that much for the truth points are given for providing link to the transcript http www fednews com transcript htm id but this required registration so haven looked at it yet

agree that republicans don have monopoly on dishonest behavior however it seems that for the past few years these kind of stunts have been coming primarily from the rw do you have an examples of liberals altering photos or blatantly taking them out of context to push an agenda not being flip let go ahead and list them the only one can think of off hand is one where some pac make commercial pointing out that troops weren coming home for thanksgiving it turns out they weren american troops they were british having said that most american troops really didn get come home for thanksgiving in so good argument could be made that the video wasn misleading think also recall black congresswoman photoshopping some white people into campaign flier in but don know if that was an urban myth or not

regardless of the particular dogma being pushed or attacked this is great example of how much our political system is tainted by marketing it bad thing that slogans matter in elections it bad thing that the most effective ads are those that appeal to our emotions and instincts instead of our minds it bad thing that people choose leaders based on their values and strong leadership instead of on actual qualifications know that to some extent this is inevitable and will always be the case but it pisses me off that we swallow this crap so bill hicks summed up the marketing evil roughly you know what the worst part is these marketing fuckers are sitting out there right now thinking ooh he got whole anti marketing thing going the anti marketing market that good market

the reason marketing exists is because it works and its not that the masses simply haven been exposed to well thought out complex analyses and cogent points of view people just like quick slogans they can grab onto from the simplistic anti war chants to mission accomplished people like britney spears you shouldn begrudge them their choice simply because it unpalatable to you heck it far more offensive to sit in judgment of how people think if they aren hurting anybody and no voting for bad candidates with slick campaigns is not hurting anyone

you re missing the point we need to change to more parliamentary system where you can vote for party that really reflects your values instead of the lesser of two or three evils then the parties with the most votes form ruling coalition use subreddit for voting on candidates where they can post their positions and have comment thread discussions with the electorate and their competitors hold yearly elections to start with adjust the frequency if things get too bureaucratic or chaotic you get the idea et voila perfect government

speaking to the mushy middle does nothing but lose elections middle types vote for whoever speaks from their values imho the entire problem with the dems is that they work so hard to appeal to the middle they have become republican lite don know about you but rather vote for republican who admits that he supports the iraqi war unitary executive and flag burning amendment than dem who claims to support democracy but acts like rubber stamp for whoever is in power by the way most people who think that was hack job still think that saddam had wmds that tells you something about the critical thinking skills of moore critics

agree with you diamond people read the reviewing trusting that amazon lets in both positive and negative reviews which really is the purpose of trust worthy the rating system just receiving positive review poisons the pool will be wary in the future possibly trying to corroborate the opinions posted at amazon with what bloggers are saying specifically bloggers that don have links to amazon with their associate id
me too just seems better because you re basically evaluating whether an object evaluates to true which does but so does etc
gt its not that the masses simply haven been exposed to well thought out complex analyses and cogent points of view that exactly what happens the marketing obscures the real issues gt and no voting for bad candidates with slick campaigns is not hurting anyone really think that is exactly what happens poor leadership can hurt people just like good leadership can help people aren charisma and charm characteristics that are common to cult leaders and con men appealing presentation and slick marketing aren the same thing marketing does work if you don make careful choices there is big difference between the guy who tries to sell you car by appealing to your transportation needs safety needs and budget and the guy who tries to sell you car by pointing out the chrome package the stereo system and the shiny paint good products sell themselves at least to some extent bad products need lot of slick packaging and sexy ad campaigns have to live with the choices made by voters in this country and happy to accept that don tell me not to encourage people to vote with their brains it in my interest and yours

much more likely that the author complained and that was the source of amazon actions wouldn think that amazon would have an interest let alone the time or the people to edit bad reviews to increase sales it makes sense that they would respond to an authors complaints since their comments to the reviewer are so discordant would imagine that he was dealing with more than one person at amazon check the listing for the book he mentions his review is posted along with other one star reviews think that this is real over reaction to frustrating event calm down folks think about it tens of thousands of books many with tens or hundreds of reviews is it likely that amazon would comb through these editing out negative reviews it would require an amount of human effort and computer time that would eclipse any enhanced revenues why is it so easy for us to beleive in these huge conspiracies than more plausable explaination think this reveiwer jumped the gun amazon would have no compelling interest in doing this and there is no evidence that there is concerted campaign to increase their sales by limiting bad reviews especially on book with pretty limited audience much more likely the author complained repetedly to protect his book

so lately have been thinking lot about qualified experts as mentioned in the article credentialism became prominent in the because of advances in transportation technology before wwi everyone lived in the same town their whole lives so anyone could vouch for you then after wwi there was increased mobility so no longer could your neighbors provide the credibility needed to get job or get startup funding thus college stepped up to fill the role of the middleman this was essential to keep society functioning although certainly credentialism hasn done much for the learning aspect of college today however we have the internet everyone is linked to everyone and anyone can vouch for you can email the management of any company and assuming follow basic email etiquette can usually get response as digital identity improves everyone will be able to vouch for you based on the information you are supplying about yourself online for example pg has his essays and one of his books on his personal website surely this is as meaningful as college degree also college credentialism is hierarchy because you have one person making value judgements about many people anyone who knows anything about network theory knows that networks are more powerful than hierarchies because metcalfe law trumps sarnoff law thus college supplied credentialism is much less effective than what we are capable of reaching if we use the internet this is why many of the qualified experts are so imcompetent because hierarchies are so much weaker than networks anyway if someone wants to make sh tload of money suggest developing some tools for the internet that start to fill the credentialist role that colleges play currently the value there will make the billion facebook is trying to get seem like peanuts

your points are well taken reasonable person wouldn think that amazon is doing this wholesale and deliberately yes it probably is likely that the author complained however the fact that amazon does this at all means that you cannot trust amazon reviews period how would you know that the reviews for book you re trying to buy has not gone through similar sanitization once the integrity of the system can be compromised you just never know how good the system is amazon should give the readers enough credit to be able to distinguish an honest star review from flamebait
that would ve never happened carry
software patents definately have the same right to exist as normal patents think the mismatch most people myself including see has to do with the obviousness of patents granted and the creative nature of the industry the design is pretty much all there is in software the build is just an automatic step whatever software engineers try to say so there are huge number of software inventors out there patent has to be truly innovative to qualify as non obvious given the depth of talent in the industry also not sure how well the bit about privateers pirates merchants really describes the origins of business in general that just particular set of circumstances without much law and order

if you think everything should be patentable you re inherently buying into the idea that everything should have an owner this pretty much eliminates free software or at least consigns it to dark corner if you think everything should be patentable then you should be okay with patenting algorithms equations and surgical procedures all of which are not supposed to be patentable at the moment if you like patents you really shouldn have problem with so called patent trolls they re buying patents and using them if you don like this maybe you don like patents quite as much as you thought is the uspto handing out software patents like candy because they don really understand software yet or powerful forces are aligned in favor of patenting software and not in favor of maintaining the benefits of vibrant software commons used to think that at least old fashioned patents were good thing then learned what the wright brothers and edison did with theirs now the benefits of patents seems lot less clear than they used to

he has struck it out to let the record show that he is accepting the emendation from the reddit crowd if he deleted it that would be worse the spinsanity link shows nothing get an error message of an error occurred while processing this directive while both sides try to re interpret things as it suits them that depends on what the meaning of is is the distortion by the gop in these images is beyond the point of the normal it is active lying on an issue of great magnitude and should be checked rather than rationalized with everyone does it ps am not democrat or republican am an indian living in india
one of amazon replies includes this gt your review still does not address the subject matter in the book nor does it offer reader any reason why they should or should not read this book other than your personal opinions that you disagree with the content that is an accurate assessment read powell criticisms carefully and was left basically uninformed the book is never quoted specific examples of what the book states and why it is wrong are not given all of his criticisms boil down to saying that the book is wrong because its author does not understand physics as proof powell gives his credentials physics graduate students and physics educator physics graduate student etc but never gives specific example of an error in the text gt based on my scientific training find that these ideas contradict the well founded and well understood ethos of modern physics why how he never explains agree with amazon on this one
it does nothing to alter the fact that moore also did the same kind of editing in his images that this blog accuses the govt of however that is the difference someone like moore is just free agent for the gop and govt to use his actions to justify theirs is unacceptable
surely amazon has an automated system to alert some group of editors when one star review is submitted if amazon is smart they will have many automated checks on the reviews this guy first review probably put his user name into database of trouble makers if was running amazon would have some sort of blacklist for reviewers so editors could pay closer attention to trouble makers future posts wouldn remove low ratings because of the potential for lost business in the future but maybe amazon is falling for the short term gain philosophy so common to american businesses

yes and all kinds of material science domains that is one difference paul seems to have glossed over you can disassemble software relatively easily new display technology manufacturing processes not so much though otherwise thought it was fine article glad he done with the startup lovefest propaganda
it would have been nice if you had read the book however this is censorship and not expected of amazon
heh all it needs is some synergy
whatever amazon has done in this case the fact that this guy submitted review for book that he hasn read pretty much destroys his credibility as far as am concerned if you re really so disgusted with book that you can finish reading it say that in your review giving book negative review based on sample chapter and the author website is just wrong yeah this book sounds like bullshit but even bullshit deserves full reading before reviewing it
the review he refered to as cleaned up http www physics buffalo edu bapowell rev html is posted http www amazon com gp cdp member reviews rcwt cy ref cm_cr_auth fencoding utf in amazon now but under the name harwood did amazon relent based on this reddit item and why the name hardwood and not brian powell what going on here
pica is always like this when he gets riled up really doubt it
only read the first three words of your post but would like to make few points first there is absolutely no proof that amazon has anything to do with my loose stools that not only off color but entirely inappropriate second your mention of whatever is entirely misplaced whatevah would make much more sense third why even mention river this is story about books think it fair to say that there no point in me even going any further into your post than the first three words what starts so poorly cannot possibly redeem itself

what do you hate about chompsky ve heard people express this feeling before but ve never really heard cogent argument that backs it up to see why hate ann coulter just read the quotes here http en wikiquote org wiki ann_coulter can you provide equivalent quotes from chompsky that show he is evil
software patents have right to exist wow next they will have right to quality health care
because people understand by finding in their memories the closest possible match to what they are hearing and use that match as the basis of comprehension any new idea will be treated as variant of something the listener has already thought of or heard agreement with new idea means listener has already had similar thought and well appreciates that the speaker has recognized his idea disagreement means the opposite really new ideas are the good news is that for some people failure to comprehend is the beginning of understanding for most of course it is the beginning of dismissal that above is schank law and that my way of saying that your comment was true epiphany thanks
why is this cool there are line mail usenet signatures in different languages perl that do that for years
bunch of out of context quotes show someone is evil her columns are sarcastic and satirical people should be able to argue point by point rather than trying to just undermine the person undermining the person is what she claims liberals do instead of arguing why back that up
its pretty obvious that mean they are equivalent in terms of their justification not every use of the word right needs to invoke the exact same meaning as the right to free speech or similar and wtf does health care have to do with it
lame and overflowing with grandmotherly concern
the author does grant two think he talking net though

flawed is not the same as fraudulent
agree that chomsky and coulter are very different cases coulter regularly calls for the death of liberals called for the us to invade arab nations and convert them to christians and other things which are beyond the pale the things that do not like about chomsky are he is constantly puffed up as great intellectual but never submits any articles to peer reviewed journals admit that while am polyglot and am not serious linguist in my time working with linguistics have found his work receives more adulation that seems appropriate while he has had significant influence especially in the his importance in linguistics gets puffed up because of his other political writings and he engages in far too much self adulation all this irritates me but it is not enough to justify hating him his rhetoric is incredibly grating after while his criticisms of us foreign policy while sometimes well founded often verge on hysterics and get extremely tedious after few books his repeat assertions that the us is at its root fascist or nazi and that the us needs to go through denazification and his repeated comparison of the policy to that of nazi germany are rhetorically repulsive on another rhetorically repulsive note in the same way that he blathers on about his own self importance in his linguistic writings he does the same in his political works while did have some reservations about the invasion of afghanistan they were focused on concern that we would not follow through with rebuilding and concern that we might not adequately push for ensuring that human rights were respected by the new regime did not want to see the taliban left unabated chomsky not only opposed any form of military action but claimed that the us would starve millions of afghanis and would essentially engage in form of genocide chomsky actually sided with the republicans in criticizing the nato intervention in kosovo to stop the genocide occurring there he has in the past defended pol pot maoist china and other regimes that find reprehensible chomsky has been repeatedly incredibly intellectually dishonest in his political writings when it served him one example is in writing about un ambassador daniel moynahan he was no angel but chomsky selectively misquoted him and attributed false quotes to him to make him appear to be someone who delighted in nazi tactics this is an incomplete list but these taken together along with other concerns run into egregious stuff when read his works but explicitly try to avoid him as much as possible now are why hate him he like michael moore serves the left poorly

startups don build desktop word processing programs to compete with microsoft word if anyone wanted to try we be interested to hear from them suspect it one of those things that not as hard as everyone assumes found this interesting my first thought is not that is hard as much as it pointless can personally think of half dozen word processing programs that compete to one degree or another with microsoft word and of the are free software intensely curious what merit paul sees in this perhaps it to prove that we can scenario

gt when you see big company threatening patent suits sell when company starts fighting over ip it sign they ve lost the real battle what does that imply about western countries scuffling over copyrights trademarks amp patents
if you think everything should be patentable you re inherently buying into the idea that everything should have an owner this pretty much eliminates free software or at least consigns it to dark corner all free software already has an owner the fact that the software is copyrighted is what makes copyleft licenses like the gpl possible in the event of infringement the copyright owner can sue to enforce the gpl software patents are bad for free software but it has nothing to do with everything having an owner the problem is unlike copyrights which are pretty much automatic patents take substantial investment of time effort and money to get investments that free software projects are unlikely to make

yeah maybe now that think about the content it seems like it could have been put better and more concisely with some writing it hits you as obvious right as you read it with others it takes bit to hit obviously this is partly product of the writing and partly of the novelty of the content however my painfully unsubstantiated gut feeling is that this one is the product of writing on the other hand the content is good certainly beats how to do what you love not entirely sure agree with all of it or at least the point of view to begin with yes in the long run hackers do generally flee evil companies but not particularly quickly and the effect of hackers having fled company takes long time to hit notice that sun is still around furthermore companies like microsoft have lured reasonably good programmers to their evil clutches despite having been from hacker point of view completely morally bankrupt for quite number of years not sure patent attack on linux would be any worse than say the halloween documents or if it were it would mean problems for microsoft in the lt year future

normally this be too pedantic but since the topic is efficiency while is faster try loop with two statements in the body simple arithmetic operation and break condition the while version should be about faster this happens because true is actually variable so the interpreter needs to look it up in the global namespace each time it is used there still difference with psyco in the case of vs true in loop headers the difference might not be big deal in practice likely the loop body consumes most time or the break condition can be placed in the loop header instead but it does give hint of one of the most important optimization tricks in python sadly missing from the article avoid references to global variables if you need to access global variable in tight loop create local copy of it this way it will be fetched from the stack instead of the global namespace this can make huge difference it can even make difference with functions minimal loop calling the abs function once in each iteration in my test gets faster when the local copy abs is called instead on the topic of optimizing loops as surprising as it may sound range is much faster than xrange for small ranges possibly up to range or so and if you have nested loops build lists of indices with range prior to the loops matrix algorithms are the perfect example of where this is good idea by the way prefer while because it saves keystrokes in addition somehow want to read while true as while the following block is true don get that urge with the

assuming the interchange presented as real find amazon pretty clearly in the wrong even though he didn read the entire book he read the opening chapter and if it was truly that bad don blame him for not reading the whole thing and would welcome his negative review and actually his first one was the most helpful it would have been very good to mention he didn finish it but as someone who been sucked in by glowing reviews posted by presumably friends of the author find the negative reviews much more helpful for books than the positive ones think amazon yielded to pressure from the author and think that weak

notice that argues that software design and hardware designs are not different at all and therefore there is no reasons to make one of them patentable and not the other yet he later claims that both kinds of designs are indeed different since hardware designs can be easily implemented by group of experts by reading non formal specification while the same is not the case fot software designs the whole essay seems to me in contradiction with one notion that tought had grabbed from prior graham essays that software design and software source code are actually the same thing but maybe misunderstood his former essays for if source code and design where the same thing there would be no need for patents copyright is good enough for protecting the intellectual property what kind of software ideas can be patented without including real source code it seems to be that either the idea has to be too simple simple enough to be written in precise way in natural language or either it has to be very very vague to really cover complex stuff and patents on very vague ideas are really bad thing maybe the law should demand software patents to be written in lisp

think mkc makes number of good points especially wish had the link but one of the better balanced critiques of the current patent system ve read traces the explosion in the number of patents granted to change in how the patent office is funded now self funding as well although ll admit there is lot of vitriol about sw patents think it more rhetoric than investigation to imply that anyone who disagrees with your viewpoint is an uninformed reactionary would say that sco and the recent rim settlement over blackberry indicates that the chilling effect of the current patent atmosphere is not trivial can tell you in the telco business that all product ideas have to go through patent clearing and the fear level is also non trivial if the major point of the essay is too many trivial patents are granted then ll agree heartily also agree that companies need to play along file for their own patents ve gotten few for my company too and hopefully for some things that aren trivial on the other hand don think there anything there that someone couldn think of in less than years of looking at the problem but also take issue with the sw is different because we re so clever even when we tell other people how to do it they can this reeks of hubris so all in all not too impressed with the essay what about the cost of getting rid of invalid patents what about all the out of court manoeuvering we don hear about what about the possibility of patents with shorter life span think patents have lost much of their original purpose encouraging innovation and have become tools for the big players to stifle new and or little ones exactly as pg mentions in the baggage handling example what to do

this is exactly the same thing was thinking of when coming to the last third of this essay am suspecting the author avoids this issue because if he was conceding here the whole point of software patents are just like other patents becomes moot there is at least one area where the current system of patents can not very easily replaced by another system of checks and balances and that is pharmacy even during the development process the companiy will have to have publicised the substance to every possible harmful aspect of it and has still years of clinical research ahead before the first dollar of revenue can be cashed in software companies are secretive to large degree most don even hand out the source code along with the binaries they sell some wouldn publish their implemented algorithm cough venue of pg speech cough what more would these companies withhold if software couldn be patented

to say they are equivalent in terms of their justification is to ignore over years of patent office precedent think having congress review their justification is in fact exactly what needs to be done this current state is entirely result of unlegislated judicial decisions that appear to have no basis in serving the public good or the economy what is you basis for believing their equivalence can almost guarantee you it is not based on extensive conversations with patent lawyers
really enjoyed your essays enormously but can agree with this one it is probably true that the current practice isn as malicious as the proponents of the anti software patents movement make us think and most certainly patents have found role in the vc business but how could they have not they are part of the assets and thats what aquisitions are about but then you go and claim that without patents everything would be kept secret and that assertion goes without any evidence except some contrieved middle ages analogy why should it be so not convinced at all and that the main grounds upon which you justify the current practice that close to troll bait the main problem and which causes all the confusion about intellectual property and patents is in fact the property analogy before intellectual property there was just property you had real estate house and so many acres of land and that was yours if in doubt or trouble with you neighbour get surveyor he would consult the triangles and the cadastre what can you do when in doubt about ip it not measurable this leads to legal uncertainty and it ultimalty just feeds lawyers watch ibm struggle with sco and that just an obvious case there are command economies communism feudalism and free ones in the free one nobody commands everything but everybody commands bit but that bit needs to be tracked explicitly property is needed to decide who controls what decebtrally in free system it reduces risk and costs of conflict here property of tanglible assets is necessity in the free system of capitalism and it makes it efficient can fully use your house your farm or your plant while you use it the opposite is true of knowledge can use your knowledge without you losing anything but gain wealth there the magic nothing gets more efficient because you cheat government into denying me to use what you know to the contrary things get really messy when you try to bring demarcations into the field of knowledge intellectual property is simply an inapt analogy to tangible property you re probably right to advise startups to build up defensive portfolios of ip agreed the distinction between the two question should patent and patents at all is good one but you shouldn excuse the whole patents practice on such shallow grounds

the problem with combining credentialism with social networking is that the talent level stratifies out at some point that is you are never going to find fortune ceos or anything close even on linkedin there are other networks that have even higher average quality than linkedin for example the young presidents organization these are basically the guys you want to hang out with if you are starting startup but even within ypo there is convergance of talent at certain level what happens is that instead of having one big network that is suitable for all types of people the online social networks of today are stratified and somewhat hierarchical for example facebook gt myspace anyway until we figure out how to create social network that doesn alienate people at the high end and attract sycophants at the low end then we should separate the credentialist aspect from the social networking aspect the great thing about these types of projects is that they are joke from the technical side anyone smart enough to read reddit would have been smart enough to code the facebook at least up until the point where it was proven viable the limiting reagant in technology projects like this idea is always the social understanding never the technology
nemo like to see some quotes and some examples that back up your points because ve read my fair share of chomsky and completely disagree gt his repeat assertions that the us is at its root fascist or nazi and that the us needs to go through denazification like to see the quote where he says this in particular in general your criticisms are poor gt he is constantly puffed up as great intellectual but never submits any articles to peer reviewed journals find that very hard to believe given that he is institute professor emeritus of linguistics at the massachusetts institute of technology and his work is described thus on wikipedia gt chomsky is credited with the creation of the theory of generative grammar often considered to be the most significant contribution to the field of theoretical linguistics in the th century your claims that he indulges in self adulation are flat out wrong chomsky is one of the more humble intellectuals out there saw him speak once and was impressed by his humility and down to earthness
combing out bad reviews would be less of problem if amazon or for what is worth slashdot imdb etc showed the average rating and its standard deviation along with the star rating of the book then you could know if the book is statistically significantly better or worse than the average one question is whether the scientific literacy of the general public allows such an approach in sense value is only differential when it is about choice something which is well incorporated into ranking systems such as reddit but then there is the problem of clustering books or links for homogeneous comparison this is the next challenge for social systems something that reddit is exploring via the subreddits system
there are now star reviews for this book out of

glad you appreciated it you might enjoy reading some educational theory even if you consider yourself technology person as assume most people on reddit do after all what sinks technology companies is almost never their lack of understanding of the technololgy but rather their lack of understand about people
just one out of lot criticisms that crossed my mind during the lecture you can compare software patents to traditional patents here why software is inherently easier to do because it doesn have to deal with the limitations of the physical world but since the people working on it are in average not dumber the resulting products are lot more complex and involve very many different ideas so you can develop an engine and know what few patents to consider but you can do that for your software project since you would have to consider thousands of them
find the repetition of the mating dance metaphor ugly
in fairness to the essay it did influence my opinion before took the standard slashdot opinion that there should be no software patents as it is in europe now wonder if it might be ok to just reform the system to reduce the power of the trolls off the top of my head one part that had to read twice was where you listed two things then said the second is like the first is like it would be quicker to process that if it had the opposite ordering
think that like most hacks he making journalistic career out of writing what the newspaper owners would like to see put in print it very effective well known strategy and hardly surprising for psychiatrist it is very clear to me that this is what is happening in this particular case because he really uses the issue as springboard to attack gordon brown who will very likely be leader of the labour party in the next year or two the times traditionally backs the tory party but more to the point murdoch papers consistently attack potential players as show of strength uk politicians believe to man that they need the backing of murdoch papers to succeed and any potential pm will negotiate their support whatever it takes think the context here is not going to be at all obvious to non uk readers because there is lot of background in the relationships within the labour party and the political affiliations of the press the point being that this article really has nothing much to do with the french situation and everything to do with domestic uk politics

exactly all really need to hear from someone who is proponent of patents but is pretending to be impartial is this gt in other words no one will sue you for patent infringement till you have money and once you have money people will sue you whether they have grounds to or not so advise fatalism don waste your time worrying about patent infringement you re probably violating patent every time you tie your shoelaces this is system worth keeping that makes no sense at all also the argument about patents being needed so people will publish how they code things up is bogus plenty of people publish algorithms anyway without patents as professional programmer ve never once read patent application to see what algorithm someone used not sure anyone would really need to either the thing about programming is everyone thinks they re smarter than everyone else came up with this amazing way of doing auctions for ads so smart there no way anyone else would ever think it but it big world out there with lots of other smart people in it

well the current system benefits the well connected generally natural born citizens while hurting the vast majority of business owners and immigrants the students who are protesting know that they really don have very marketable skills so they want gasp the government to fix their problems rather than learning new skills the students are not fully to blame up until now the government has encouraged this behavior protest is expected the problem is that the damage done by this policy is not as visible as the artificial advantage conferred on well connected and already employed otherwise there be more support from unemployed immigrants and business owners that typical government strategy take lot away quietly and give little back ostentatiously good economics is the art of seeing the quietly taken lot

did enjoy the essay but when you wrote one of my main hobbies is the history of technology and even though ve studied the subject for years it would take me several weeks of research to be able to say whether patents have in general been net win that just made me stop reading for while and wonder why you didn do these several weeks of research that way it might have been much more compelling essay

from another article of the same author ve peeked this the current demonstrations by students of french universities against proposed liberalization of the labor laws so that it will be easier for french employers to hire and fire young people remind me very much of the strike by miners on the witwatersrand in south africa in the demonstrators in france and the strikers in south africa are and were supported by their respective national communist parties the miners went on strike because the mine owners proposed to replace expensive white labor with cheap black labor hoping to increase profits this move provoked one of the most bizarre political slogans of all time promoted by the communist party workers of the world unite for white south africa hilarious and the link http www city journal org html eon td html
you need to justify why medieval secrecy would return in the age of open source sure people would be more secretive but you did say that software is mostly useful in implementation and not just as an idea the second problem is justifying how software patent which could run on any general processor is the same as device that is unless you have nano assembler that could make any device with spec copyrights exist for implementations hardware patents exist for designs of device so where do you draw the line between software patent and copyright by specificity if your spec if specific enough to be the software then its an implementation covered by copyright if not not then its likely very broad and probably bad still see algorithms as discovered much like theories in the math sense in other scope business method patents seem like pure hogwash there is nothing similar to patents about that its purely an idea and shouldn be patentable why because people will look for new business methods whether they can patent them or not progress will not be served by restricting that with patents

he uses the term denazification in few works but the most famous instance is in american power and the new mandarins which encourage you to read thoroughly that was actually the work that pushed me over the edge in my opinions of chomsky who really wanted to like since am good hearted liberal intellectual type could not fid it online heard he now posts all his stuff but cursory search did not locate it and no longer own copy so can give you page number but you can google it and find large number of cites with respect to publications may well be wrong since first noted the issue back in and it not something follow or care about so he might have submitted an article to peer reviewed journal since then did another cursory search and did not find anything but since am no longer in academia might not be using the appropriate resources think it would be easy to show me an example of an article on linguistics that has been submitted to peer reviewed journal to prove me wrong that wikipedia article does not make any case for your assertion with respect to his pride his writing and speaking skills are irrelevant indeed he is great speaker and have been very impressed the few times that saw him he is also really good writer especially when he writes about politics he writes clearly and is very engaging but the impressions got of his self adulation were what got honestly am not going to slog though that crap again on your behalf especialy since have sold off all my chomsky books the sense got of it was stronger in his academic writings but were there in his political writings too perhaps since only read limited selection of his work got the wrong impression on side note do know few linguists who are very critical of his academic work and his person who originally pointed out the issue with his publications perhaps that has biased me though perhaps if you view him critically some works might be read in different light where his triumphalism would be more apparent whether he indulges in overweening pride or not could have expanded my concerns about chomsky quite lot if you would like as had more to say was trying to be terse since know that few read long posts questions for you what do you have to say about him defending pol pot was it acceptiable for him to defend mass murderer who slaughtered all the intellectuals in his country he could find who had anyone wearng glasses shot on sight since they posed the threat of being literate who gave us the nauseating tourist attraction the killing fields
have to strenuously object to the negative moderation of this comment although did not read it the rest of the thread was full of interesting and witty responses based on the circumstantial evidence have collected this comment is obviously winner and reddit should probably place it on ilboards of popular highways around the world as an example of the quality experience found on reddit

if could ever give advice to you paul graham it right now take that paragraph out it doesn do anything for your argument or maybe just rephase it to something like patents are complicated issue then agree with you
isn rsa encryption decent patent it is novel and pretty specific as far as software patents go
object to this entire thread have not even bothered to read it as it clearly consists of nothing more than bunch of puffed up self important so called redditors replying to each other in turn in puerile and misguided attempt to appear more clever and witty than the previous poster what utter drivel
although agree with your point this specific instance does not even give book the benefit of even cursory examination there has to be minimum point at which someone can claim to have read enough to get sense of book looking at supporting materials on website does not qualify books have editors and pre release reviews to help an author figure out the best way to express their point websites generally do not basing book review off the authors website does not take into account additional factors that could have made the book better

people opinion is based on silly anecdotes the ones where software patents do more harm than good in areas where it affects them things like lzw and gif graphics mp and linux distros mono and net etc think it would be very hard to measure how much patents are moving an industry forward as opposed to keeping it locked up and dragged down the other question is how much it helps in generating wealth my religious conviction tells me that software patents are too long they should just give first mover advantage if anything after years they just stall others not help the inventor love to be able to find some proof for that but that sounds difficult

to tell the truth hadn really cared about chomsky in years since am no longer in academia and only follow politics peripherally most of that was me reading books and articles and discussing things mostly with inguists grad students and professors my dislike of chomsky grew out of that environment believe it or not there are fair share of academic liberals who have serious issues with chomsky since he is irrelevant to me really haven bothered to look at him again and sold my stack of chomsy books off more than few years ago and pitched my highly faded xeroxes in the chomsky file along with the folder itself having spent some time this morning looking at the anti chomsky tripe that is out there on the web can see where you are coming from intellectual midgets like the excrebal david horowitz and the freepers have mangled the debate and are indeed making lot of baseless claims please disregard my opinions on his writing my notes on his triumphalism while not wholly subjective my views could be colored by various factors here are my questions for you what do you think of his position on kosovo do you agree what do you think of his position on afghanistan do you agree what do you think of his defense of the khmer rouge do you agree have you read american power and the new mandarins

his calculation is based on flawed assumption gt but let assume that amazon would claim nothing is wrong there is no underlying pattern that might lead to higher propensity of one star reviews since yesterday that would imply that the any special preponderance of one star reviews since yesterday would be mere coincidence no underlying pattern like say reddit users writing one star reviews yeah sure the distribution of reviews for yesterday was exactly the same as the historical average
how is review that does not discuss any specifics of the book appropriate for book review his comments amount to this book sucks should know because am grad student that doesn really help me much he hand waves his way around why the book is not any good and simply asserts that it represents fundamental of scientific principles the review was crap give reasons give examples but don give me your vague assesment to trust blindly because you feel you are domain expert
this looks good but it bit long to read
think this is more of an etiquette thing than something that should be enforced but here an interesting thought if this is implemented people will still be able to edit and empty the whole comment that not bad actually at least they ll still have their names there and can be held accountable for their flamewars starting to like this idea more and more voting it up

gt that is not the point the point is that there are different employment laws for people depending on their age also think that is not quite correct precisely the french government would never even contemplate trying to scrap employment laws like this across the board as it could shut down europe europeans consider us style employment practises to be backwards and would never put up with them
if you re saying that doesn affect then surely by definition this means you re comparing with against without
this exact same thing occurred to me however he makes good point in response to this in addition there may be other explanations to the propensity of recent one star reviews for instance they could all be due to the reddit posting however reading the reviews this does not appear to be the case most of them give ample evidence of direct knowledge of the book and thoughtful criticism which would seem to imply that the majority of the recent star reviews were made by people who have read the book probably not very many of them read it in the last hours however you may be partially correct many of those reviewers could be people who had already read the book or at least part of it but didn feel the need to actually post review until mr powell story hit the top of reddit
also would assume that having review popularity system the was this review helpful link allows amazon to weight reviews differently if review has lot of votes saying it was not helpful it probably does not have much of rating

have been getting comments on the blog post itself to that effect responded as follows er know that why said in addition there may be other explanations to the propensity of recent one star reviews for instance they could all be due to the reddit posting however reading the reviews this does not appear to be the case most of them give ample evidence of direct knowledge of the book and thoughtful criticism as also said the calc is for fun let not take it too seriously maybe ll have to give an ever stronger caveat

included that paragraph because one of the distinctive features of talk about patents in the world of hackers is the impassioned priori argument owning ideas unthinkable wanted to show that there is another way to approach the question by asking how do patents work in practice and though don answer that in the general case do try to for software patents you think the pragmatic approach would be the one hackers would naturally favor that how they approach most things but on the question of patents lot of hackers behave like evangelical christians do about evolution they treat it as matter of principle rather than question to be decided by looking at the world

of the one star reviews added in the last day of them were copies of reviews from powell original article one of them was copied twice and of them didn actually reference the book contents so think somewhere between and of those reviews probably much closer to were added due to the reddit posting
think that one of the rules regarding the holder of trademark should be implemented on patents if you don enforce your right to it either by education litigation or other means you loose the privilege it provides to you kleenex and aspirin learned this the hard way xerox almost did as well and it the reason that when you ask for coke at an establishment that serves pepsi products you get asked if pepsi is ok to deal with those companies that want the patent but want the ability to share it with others there should be some sort of copyleft allowance possibly multiple tiers that they can assign to the patent to allow others to use it within stated means

ok here the update added to my post in response to the above further update lt href http reddit com info id gt someone lt gt over at reddit notes that there are now neg reviews and guesses that between and of the one star reviews are due to the reddit posting as the most pessimistic case assume that there are only legit ones that gives result of or still below the usual statistical limit of that leads the rejection an assumption null hypothesis so as statistical test the conclusion stands even under the harshest numerical criticism ve received however do now wish had counted the suspicious ones instead of forming rush impression before doing my initial calculation it nuisance that people are focusing on the extreme number calculated when it really isn necessary to be that extreme for deriving the statistically valid conclusion and it is probable that at least couple of those reviews were due to reddit change the calc now but there are already lot of links out there so think should just leave it
so do you think most americans you know would agree with the author economic analysis that more carpenters and artisans will cure french youth unemployment

so why does everyone on reddit seem to think that employers need the privilege of firing workers for no reason at all because incompetence or breach of terms contract obviously isn legally or morally valid reason to fire somebody eh this isn about being able to fire it about being able to fire arbitrarily and without cause
doesn make it any more ethical for them to do so though
it is also mathematics it pre existed the three guys who came up with it by the whole time the universe existed it also hampered efforts to have decent encryption imo rsa patent was serious net loss
wouldn this type of analysis be lot more interesting for book randomly selected on amazon rather than one in which obvious biases are at play right now understand that this is just for your own amusement but doesn this one simple change vastly improve the quality of your study and therefore your post
also take an area of research say materials engineering there are relatively small number of researchers in the area in relatively small number of institutions and an incredibly huge shitload of users of the technologies all over the world the legal depts can keep track of their competitors patent portfolios and avoid or work around if need be now how many programmers are there in the world working for how many institutions how many material engineers vs programmers has the average bank or insurance company you see my point think

we know that this book has been the subject of one person brian getting his one star reviews rejected and the reviews that were rejected look perfectly good to me so it seems arguable that valid experiment is to test the reviews for just one book which is one that is suspect because even if every book doesn receive this kind of tilt if some subset of the books do that problem so response would be should do as you propose if the test was to see if as uniform principle reviews were screened in this way but am less interested in that than am in the hypothesis that some books are screened that way note that did not use the data that brought the book to my attention in the analysis so the analysis was not skewed by that data if indeed amazon does not ever have skew against any book then it wouldn matter that the book was brought to my attention by someone who thought his review was unfairly rejected as long as didn use that data in my analysis

absence of evidence evidence of absence and ll prove it right here yes know your post is tongue in cheek but still it particularly annoying falacy that like to stamp out wherever see it come up consider two mutually exclusive hypothesies and and some piece of evidence now from the rules of conditional probability we can easily get the following in other words the odds ratio of hypothesis being true vs hypothesis being true given observed evidence is the likelyhood ratio of that is the ratio of the probabilities that would have been observed given was true vs given was true multiplied by the prior odds ratio so evidence favors hypothesis ie the left side of the equation is larger than the prior ratio if and only if gt okay so far now multiply both sides of that criteria by of course fliping the gt to lt along the way so we have lt no problem so far right add to both sides lt hrm given any particular state the total probability of something happening or not happening so now we have lt that is the probability of not given is less then the probability of not given but wait that basically the criteria needed for to favor vs therefore absence of evidence evidence of absense qed

there difference between the researchers using the media to publish and the media themselves latching onto scientific issue think that global warming and health scares are case of the latter to the degree that outside forces have influenced the media to pay extra attention to these issues those forces have been political al gore wrt global warming rather than scientific from what ve seen researchers in these fields with no doubt few exceptions are just as cautious and thorough with their work as any other scientists however both have proven to be great hot button big sell issues for the media so naturally they the media have given them extra publicity
why is this news
yeah you re right read that in book somewhere whose pdf was online hang on ah here it is information theory inference and learning algorithms http www aims ac za mackay itila book html section it should really be absence of proof is not proof of absence
uh dunno what logical fallacy you think supplied if your speed is zero because of some force applied to you then that force is having an important effect on you if patents are keeping us at some kind of status quo then they are having an important effect on the industry whatever mechanism there is for that effect is not addressed by his article he suggests that software companies are not in general affected by patents he seems to try to say initially that patents basically don do anything don prevent anyone from implementing them at startups or at larger companies and the only beneficial use he suggests is that they tell your acquirers that you have somewhat unique product but then he says they do do something they prevent companies from using secrets instead ok so what are they getting out of patents that they wouldn get out of secrets either they are getting something or they wouldn really switch to secrets anyway
while agree with all sentiments that the author is piece of shit retard think this law would be good thing for everyone in france this will definitely promote more immediate hiring lifting restrictions lets companies hire more aggressively even if you are unfairly fired within years you accumulated earnings and marketable skills that put you in better job searching position than if you had not worked at all young people with experience are highly marketable employment segments understand that they ve revised the law to force employers to have cause so dishonest exploitation will be punisheable

actually believe that stated if god does exist and if prayer was our way of communicating with him and he did indeed act on those prayers would we expect him to do exactly what we wanted and to answer every prayer stated what vain being to only help those that ask beg really for it said that god wouldn necessarily answer all our prayers interpreted that to having to do with god answering people who really begged never stated that said prayer does help not that it produces immediate results all the time
things commented on the message of the graphic not my own views don know and don particularly care what your or anyone else vision of god specific form is interested in the question of how if at all being religious changes the way person percieves and understands the world the people who never say because god made it so would be from atheists and agnostics in the classification scheme used in the graphic because they would not attribute to god any effect on the physical world it would be extremely interesting to talk to person who was religious believed in god but never invoked god as the cause of anything including things like the fundamental physical constants planck the fine structure etc are you such person if so what is your view of god role in the universe
no actually it about being able to fire deliberately and with cause something that currently illegal in france this law would allow shopkeepers to fire someone who been loafing for weeks and has been warned repeatedly in france once you re employed it virtually impossible for the employer to terminate employment outside of massive and knowing breach of law

it pity that the economist doesn just leave their editorials as free content this one does better job of summing up the problem http www economist com opinion displaystory cfm story_id in short what they are saying is that there are two classes and that that not fair of course they don take the position that everyone should have jobs for life as the protesters want but that rather the protesters being young and presumably eager to work would have better shot at things if their elders weren lodged in jobs that it is impossible to pry them out of that certainly true in italy where there are laws like the one in france that create less protected jobs as small example take two people my wife is working on her doctorate at the university like phd students everywhere she isn paid well doesn have much in the way of benefits and were she to say get pregnant she would be out on her ass in no time flat don let the phd part fool you though her contract is legally the basic flexible no protection variety her friend on the other hand was hired at real job about year ago not too long after she and her husband conceived and the baby was born in january she left work few months before the event and when we went to visit her recently said that she probably won go back until september she wouldn want to leave her baby somewhere in july when she would be eligible to go back to work just to have to keep it at home again in august when everything shuts down and everyone goes on vacation like it or not only to have to take the baby back to the care center again in september it would be so traumatic yes she got months of that paid at full wages and the rest at something like do you see some inequity there guess who paying for who in general terms to take her cushy year off of work guess why companies generally try and avoid women of child bearing age like the plague for real jobs there are two models that seem to work pretty well the anglo saxon model despite its problems is more or less meritocratic modulo monkey man or two as president it can be bit harsh at times but it does work for lot of people things like health care could use some tweaking though the nordic model where companies are free to hire and fire according to their needs but there is strong state that will take care of you if you fall on bad times this is paid for by society at large through very high taxes but at least it paid for by everyone in italy the state doesn do much at all in terms of taking care of the unemployed less than in the states as far as what can figure out except that of course you get health care so people get really scared about clinging to jobs surveys continue to indicate that majority of even young people would prefer stable boring job to their dream job if the dream job were risky gather that france is similar in the approach they take
worth an up for the pic alone
reviews in two days is an unusually high number when compared to other books of similar sales rank given that those reviews all appeared after the reddit posting don think it entirely out of the realm of possibility to assume that all of them were due to the reddit effect that would be my most pessimistic case not the that you cite in which case the analysis cannot be performed at all and the study becomes completely invalid again understand this is all just for fun but think you have to at least concede that possibility

and for the most part in software if you give us venetian glass we can figure out how to make it certainly this is the case for the trivial software patents that we hate thought we never heard this secrecy argument because the real point is that with secrecy many software ventures don make economic sense and would thus not be created rsa for example derives its value from being publicly scrutinized if anybody could just copy the ipod interface then apple would never have created it of course don believe that true would they then keep the ipod interface secret uh no mean theoretically it could cause further shift away from individuals being able to control their own computers more companies might have software that ran only on their computers and everyone who interacted with the software would be ndad because if someone saw your brilliant should be patented interface they copy it and there have been no point to your huge amp expenditures certainly don think he saying that viaweb would have kept the content of their patents as guarded secrets that wouldn be independently invented but can anyone think of any patents that kindof apply here stuff in spss clementine stuff in high end graphics or video maybe we just aren deep enough experts in any opaque enough field to be exposed to this kind of patent is this what pg is talking about this point about secrecy was the only element of the essay that haven seen discussed to death elsewhere

don believe potential employers should just look at code samples they should also watch you code live over weeks on large open source project of your choosing in this way they will get more accurate picture of what you would do on daily basis if they hired you working on such system which has other uses as well http vnccasts com in fact in this approach you would not even apply for job potential employers would sit in on your live coding sessions and may chat with you and or other viewers any time you code live you may end up being interviewed with one or more potential employers
well guess it true that it not as unethical as had previously felt the quoted reviews often printed on the back covers of books are deliberately selected as well still think it not quite right because everyone knows the back cover reviews are going to be biased whereas on amazon there is kind of expectation that you re getting fair set of reader comments afaict amazon doesn do anything to reduce this impression

hmmm where to start first of all written chinese has very little to do with spoken chinese mandarin is spoken language the written equivalent does indeed have thousands of characters and rich history see for example the excellent swallowing clouds by zee for some of the history intertwined with cooking tidbits but the spoken language is quite different when travelling in china last year we noticed there were significant differences in speaking patterns and word use between beijing and for example kunming in sechuan mandarin is an attempt at universal chinese spoken language but it has only been partially succesful much like there were very different versions of english until the mass media began wiping cockney and franglais and off the map learning to speak the language is very very hard since the phonemes are quite different however you could learn to write it without speaking word since they are not phonetic symbolic equivalents like english or most indoeuropean languages are learning to write it is apparently even harder my kids and wife learned it gave up because as you say of the thousands of characters with highly specific contextual semantics the article was talking largely about the spoken language you could learn to speak it and use the pinyin phoneticized language or variant to type it without using traditional characters

censoring negative reviews is not that surprising they re business trying to sell books not public free speech forum it does strike me as unethical to give deceptive reasons for the censorship as the reviewer noted they only apply the personal opinion and comments about the author rules to yank bad reviews not good ones and some versions of the review were deleted without violating any of those rules at all that doesn exactly jibe with the lofty claim we encourage all voices to respond openly in our store both positive and negative we wholeheartedly support the right to free speech this kind of bullshit is pretty much standard corporate practice but imho companies that engage in it deserve all the costs and bad publicity they get especially since amazon profits great deal from the reviews people provide them for free they seem to want not only free lunch but the privilege of firing the waiter if it not prepared exactly to their liking

was browsing the legal section during lunch on very productive day and came across book on passing the patent bar not especially interested in doing this but was curious enough to read bit apparantly you have to have either an accredited degree in branch of science or engineering or certain amount of coursework in sci eng to qualify to sit for the exam or pass the fe exam there may be few others then came list of courses that don qualify you for the patent bar guess what on it mathematics courses ph in math does not qualify to become patent agent suppose this means math ph doesn qualify to review patents either civil engineer who has written bit of fortran does qualify but math major doesn the historical context does make bit of sense like paul wrote algorithms were not to be patented only mechanical inventions grounded in physical science were patentable while math and physical sciences are closely related math wasn patentable so guess it made sense that mathematicians weren allowed to be members of the patent bar but algorithms are clearly patentable now unfortunately the patent bar isn just failing to identify the best people to evaluate these patents they have specifically deliberately excluded them no wonder it such mess can see two reasons for this the people who run the patent bar are idiots the people who run the patent bar are brilliant and are cynically manipulating the system cartel will reliably take actions to increase demand and restrict supply allowing alorithms to be patented increases demand allowing mathematicians to become members on the other hand increases supply allow algorithms to be patented but pretend you haven bingo
that overly harsh if had known this would get attention as something serious would have spent more time on it and that wouldn have gotten by explicitly stated that it was for our amusement for chrissake now that it is being taken seriously stand behind the updated blog post which think reasonable people will judge to come to the same end conclusion with regard to statistically significant result as the unupdated one ll paste some text here from where responded to josh comments on my blog josh it just seems so unlikely though if you read the reviews don think the ones who were specific and give evidence of having read the book actually went out and read it due to reddit or that they were lying another possibility is that they had already read the book and reddit convinced them to post review that too seems to me to be very unlikely so yes concede your point but still think that if we want to use the data to judge whether amazon is tilted against one star reviews it more reasonable to say that those possibilities are too unlikely to matter much particularly since weighed against those arguments that tell us to give the benefit of the doubt to amazon there is brian actual experience where they did repeatedly reject his one star review if we re going to weigh in the pro amazon arguments shouldn we weight that in too but we can think the approach have taken is reasonable as middle ground usually in statistics sample size of is not enough to generate statistical significance for instance if you want to know whether coin is weighted toward giving heads and you throw it twice and get heads both times the probability of that is the cutoff for something to be called statistically significant is usually see for instance http www surveysystem com signif htm this is usually called the alpha level the die example above therefore does not reach statistical significance in most real world cases small handful of cases do not result in statistical significance so there vague sense in the common wisdom that you need more cases for significance but actually the question is whether the alpha level of is attained or not and it doesn matter what the sample size is if it is attained but reiterate what said before this is not rigorous finding for reasons discussed in our earlier exchange

reminds me of just about everything robert anton wilson writes about in the cosmic trigger series of books
chinese person that grew up in the states must concur that learning the writing system is pain though people often make it out to be harder than it is reading chinese involves learning to recognize around characters which is somewhat easier than it sounds because most characters recycle the same or so pieces most characters are composed out of two to five of them which makes identification somewhat like reading two to five lettered word though of course pronunciation is only hinted at if at all writing chinese interestingly enough has been made almost trivial by technology if by writing we mean typing typing in chinese is easier than reading and is comparable to typing in an alphabetic language since one popular input method is simply to type in phonetic transcription with the computer helping to pick out the correct homophones
