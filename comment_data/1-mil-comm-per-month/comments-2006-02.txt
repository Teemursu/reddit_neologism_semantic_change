thank you willis this seems to be bunk self discipline doesn standard deviation out well how do you measure it it unlike iq is highly subjective and non controversial perhaps more importantly two year study of eighth graders is just crap if they check back in in twenty years or so this would perhaps have shred of validity but not heck of lot happens with eighth graders they tend not to start companies write code or even novels for whatever reason agree fundamentally that self discipline is important but even the most disciplined person cannot teach themselves eg lisp if they lack the cerebral capacity
this was the first paul graham article read that brought me to the realisation that like many bright people paul does not realise the boundary where the intelligence of his insights cease not terrible but it really did bring me to the opinion that paul is oblivious about at least some of his own limitations

it made clear that it not in the nature of pitbulls to attack here direct quote from the article most dogs fight as last resort when staring and growling fail pit bull is willing to fight with little or no provocation not disputing the fact that most bad pit bulls have bad owners but much rather bad owner raise breed that doesn try to inflict the maximum amount of damage on an opponent think the author comparison to profiling is fitting if profiling can help prevent the next it unthinkable to not use it as preventitive tool likewise if town ordinance against pit bulls can help prevent my son from getting his face ripped off all for it
but it really did bring me to the opinion that paul is oblivious about his own limitations you ve managed to set table that all bashers of paul can admire without putting any legs under it maybe your wisdom is obvious to the other aren we so smart folks in your club but would you care to actually make an arguable statement
the same article had the following quote carl herkstroeter the president of the says ve tested half of them and of the number ve tested have disqualified one pit bull because of aggressive tendencies they have done extremely well they have good temperament they are very good with children it can even be argued that the same traits that make the pit bull so aggressive toward other dogs are what make it so nice to humans there are lot of pit bulls these days who are licensed therapy dogs the writer vicki hearne points out their stability and resoluteness make them excellent for work with people who might not like more bouncy flibbertigibbet sort of dog when pit bulls set out to provide comfort they are as resolute as they are when they fight but what they are resolute about is being gentle and because they are fearless they can be gentle with anybody the author made an argument against the pit bull breed in the beginning of the article and then blew it apart with some of the text quoted above his point was that pit bulls were not dangerous enough to ban the image of the evil pit bull was just an unfounded sterotype just like the unfounded and useless sterotypes we have about what terroist looks like

all learned from my programming paradigms classes can be reduced to oop is powerful great for enterprise software and better to get high paying blob coding job functional languages are very powerful and underused lisp is more expressive so should use it rather than pure functional languages can be more productive in prolog than in any other language but my code can become terribly obscure to understand later so better not use logic programming for any reasonable sized project newer paradigms are usually bullshit any comments from an experienced programmer

pit bull euthanized after attack on de year old http kyw com local local_story_ html http isteve blogspot com malcolm gladwell on why his bestseller html anyway the anti pit bull laws are hardly direct analogy to racial profiling by police much closer analogy would be when the cops pay more attention to pit bull running loose than to labrador retriever running loose and is that really so morally reprehensible or pragmatically ineffectual but if you go look up the data on people killed by dogs you find that of the deaths from for which the breed of dog is known were due to pit bull type breeds along with people killed by part pit bull mixed breed dogs pure bred rottweilers were far back in second place with kills and pure bred german shepherds in third with unfortunately we don have terribly good data on the number of dogs by breed but certainly the labrador retriever is vastly more common than all the various pit bull breeds combined yet only one person in those two decades was killed by pure bred labrador and four by part labradors moreover the danger to children who comprise about of dog fatalities from pit bulls relative to labradors is even worse than these numbers suggest because sensible dog owners buy dog breeds based on likely exposure to children if you have small child you are much more likely to buy labrador to be his pet rather than pit bull gladwell misses the salient point about bulldog breeds they tend to be wonderfully loyal to their owners but precisely because they are so monogamous in their loyalties they can be dangerous to others such as your child friends for example if they get into fight with your child in contrast labradors are promiscuously friendly so you don have to worry about your lab eating guest who gets out of hand at your kid birthday party

building ugly cities is certainly not something that america does exlusively one thing perhaps counting against cities in the states is that many are old cities now compared to what is being developed in asia if you were to develop city now you would base lot of the decisions on what cities were in the past and how to improve on that model when first saw the skyline of manhatten was suprised by how antiquated much of it looked but it is very old modern city so don know why it suprised me at first as the world first and probably still vying for the best major metropolis it piece of living history newer cities or ones undergoing rapid redevelopment have the benefit of standing on the shoulders of giants say

precisely all kids pick on every other kid they can by normals have an outgoing tact filter and nerds have an incoming tact filter by everyone has an outgoing filter nerds realize that tact is control variable that they can tweak to affect the quality of their lives the only exceptions by are the super rich or super talented this allows the people around them to tolerate the tactlessness with the hope of some gain thus these folks cannot have more comfortable lives by inculcating tact and may never realize that it is control variable unless they lose their riches talent

what exactly is pit bull type breed most people wouldn know http www com petbull findpit html pitbull if it bit them on the rear so they call any dog that bites people and is stocky looking pitbull type breed that bit like calling any middle eastern south asian person who does something antisocial an arab then generalizing that arabs should be viewed with suspicion because they want to blow us up people who want mean dogs tend to prefer muscular powerful dogs because they re more intimidating sometimes it pitbulls sometimes rottweilers and sometimes some random breed you ve never heard of that looks similar to pitbull but isn related at all my original point stands it should be illegal for mean people to own dogs of any kind
it is made clear that it is not in the nature of pitbulls to attack humans they were bred with dog fighting in mind and do tend to have above average dog aggression

wouldn claim to be an experienced programmer just yet but think have enough experience to comment languages that are purely are great for teaching about for doing real work it optimal to have multiple paradigms available so you can use whatever techniques map most cleanly to the problem you re working on in the real world it also helps to have good libraries that one of the main reasons perl is still as popular as it is like using ruby for small stuff and common lisp for big stuff your statement about lisp also applies to ruby it the most expressive non lisp language ve used

well starforce ain no darling that for sure but publishers use them because it works when say works mean publishers see it taking longer before cracked versions of games appear on torrent sites and newsgroups not one to advocate starforce products having installed panzers phase gorgeous game marred by starforce but there are other aspects of this issue than just malware snuck in by legally bought game cd fact is starforce games are very hard to copy forget all the rest because this fact is all the publishers look at fact is that illegally copied games are threatening to suck the life out of pc gaming very few pc titles make sales numbers to numb the impact of illegal copying for the rest every single sale is important starforce hasn just come about because of cynical publishers is my point they have also come about because we as pc gamers do not feel the need to pay for pc games if we want starforce to go away we have another part to play other than just complaining we got to start paying for our pc games

the article seems to state that preventing suicides is an inherently good thing say that the right of suicide yes consider it right is part of personal autonomy like any other sure many people commit suicide because of clinical depression or with an unsound mind but don think this is the case for all suicides it can seem strange idea that suicide might ever be justified but think if person is sound of mine it their choice whether they wish to keep on living
agree the tone of his reply is ha ha starforce now sic ing my minions on you and it too bad that you and are going to get modded down for this just because other people don agree for awhile there could convince myself that people were getting modded down not for unpopular views but because they expressed them in an overly hostile way that could account for say two of the people that modded you down because you have to admit attention whore is far from neutral but the third guy he modded you down just because you feel differently about cory doctorow than he does ve seen too many perfectly harmless and respectful comments that nonetheless get modded down to think otherwise dear reddit folks disagreement isn bad thing in fact that one of the primary ways you learn new stuff can we all just get along save the down arrow clicking for trolls and comments that don contain any relevant information

hmm people help me out don seem to get the entire point of this article discussion yeah sure great software can live in kb so what great software can also live in kb or in kb or in mb or in insert value of your choice here insert unit of your choice here what great software anyway you can seriously compare what great or useful today with what was great or useful in come on give me break tetris can live in kb but you can surf the web or steer jumbo jet with tetris is µtorrent great just because it lives in kb then could just as well argue that µtorrent is total crap because it doesn fit bytes ah and for you joel spolsky fans out there you should probably read this http www joelonsoftware com articles fog html

think your definition of discipline is little off entrepreneurs are the definition of discipline they do hard things for long time in the hopes of very large amounts of gratification when it all over what entrepreneurs don have is the checklist mentality that we ve all been conditioned to believe is important by the public school teachers and irs drones in fact the same fuck what you say gonna get rich mentality that drives entrepreneurs would tend to make them underachievers as you put it
yes it person choice whether to die or not but you want them to make that choice based on reality not misguided perceptions the article mentions that thomas joiner dad killed himself and the implication is that he did so under the mistaken impression that he was unwanted and unappreciated if he brought that up it may have prevented joiner family from losing member

gt you miss the point he saying the book has little value precisely because the author more or less purposefully through his selection criteria created caricature of america no his point is that he thinks it is mocking americans and there no point for book that openly mocks americans to be written in english this is despite the fact that his description of the text made it look lot like alistaire cooke letters from america http news bbc co uk hi programmes default stm or even his own prarie home companion radio broadcast the only reasons can imagine he wouldn think the book should be translated into english would be he pandering to anti french sentiment or he simply forgot about the rest of the english speaking world considering the fact that he does honda commercials in britain guessing he pandering gt as for the obesity issue there are two things wrong with your statement one keillor is years old cursory search on the web shows that about percent of men his age are overweight so what gt two yes he taking issue with the notion that all americans are fat because it simply not true haven read the book but nowhere in the review did he say it claims all americans are fat although is significant majority take into consideration that the fact that bernard henri lévy is directly competing with keillor through this book would you seriously consider gm reviews of honda cars microsoft critiques of apple software

the placebo effect is the same as the conscious decision to get better fat people who take any action towards losing weight will necessarily lose more weight than people who take no action extremely few people would completely rely on the magic pill and the magic pill alone and the placebo effect is measuring statistical aggregate some lose weight while some have no effect the total is net aggregate effect another somewhat related effect can cure my headaches and coughs by simple conscious decision that it should go away headaches are more challenging to consciously manage than coughs but with enough time and concentration it goes away key word there is time whether or not have any real conscious power over my health time alone cures and wrapped in the placebo effect is both of those the historical mistake of science is to have attached the power of delusion to the medical and pharma intervention is one of self importance one way to test this theory as an explanation of the placebo effect would be to seperate smokers into groups ones who have no interest in quitting and those with varrying inclinations towards quitting people with no interest in quitting smoking will be unlikely to quit even if given chemicals with real nicotine substitutes people who get advice from plumber expert are more likely to get plumbing problem fixed even when the plumber doesnt do any real work than those people who do not seek expert advice

it seems to me the major point is that functionally identical software can live in say kb or mb and that those other mb are therefore well what besides unnecessery and no you couldn make that argument because it is pretty much impossible to fit it in that much there probably more concepts involved than bytes oh sure maybe if the language has enough libraries with the unaddressed library cheat you could with almost any language you regularly refer to implementations be it the vm code dynamically linked library or somesuch with compiled language you usually compile considerable part of implementation into your executable for speed and also there static linking which are usually used to have something not break when your set of installed libraries isn quite the same lesser evil in the imperfect environment that is pick computer any computer of course by just the size measure that would make it suck then again consider for example centericq disassembled it once because could not get my head around why the executble alone was mb it turned out to mostly be compiled templates that were probably mostly never used its creators probably didn want to rewrite everything without templates and it worked that sort of attitude isn necessarily bad but it does bloat things beyond what is necessary then consider menuetos mb and is complete graphical operating system with networking and few games sure it an extreme case because it written in assembly but on the other hand why can everything compile that well gcc uses rtl which suppose adds overhead by translation to being imperfect but still the fact that identical functionality can be implemented in code many many times as big small is not only bloat it regularly an indication of the bored add bits of code to this ide here until they seem to work attitude fear goes into many things hmm
of course joel point about swapping is very good even if it relying on the os based workaround the workaround is effective should have added that what meant with unnecessary bloat is with the same amount of work planning and consideration which is little iffy as an argument because convenience is likely the largest reason for bloat

indeed it is not saying condone starforce but the reason it is being used is because it works publishers find very few legal customers have issues with starforce http forums ubi com groupee forums tpc and they see their sales go up as result of using it since starforce is in use and more and more so is positive seen from the perspective of publishers not saying don complain saying that if declined using starforce would not increase sales the would get negative faster than if we just work on increasing we have to make it an interesting proposition to not use starforce and at the moment we re only working with the one variable we re not being as effective as we could be

an interesting perspective but one that disagree with completely people are happiest when their wealth is increasing not if it is just high in this way they compare themselves to their past selves even the author is unhappy because he could not walk on property that the owner previously allowed him to he mentions that in the us average well being has declined but draws the wrong conclusion which is that everyone getting wealthier is the problem the problem is when government prevents people from earning and keeping wealth people have no choice to compare themselves to their neighbors rather than simply looking at their own progress and finally the author sounds bit like spoiled child when he asserts that people have right to walk on property they do not own how about right to drive other people cars or live in other people houses when they re not at home
agree that convenience laziness is factor however not sure if it the largest one for instance we shouldn forget the ever shrinking time to market let me repeat that ever since the first piece of software was created the time to market has been continuosly shrinking in the same time the number of features has been constantly rising the deadline for your application is slipping and your boss or even worse your customer comes in and tells you to cram in yet another new features in minutes so you just copy amp paste lines of code then edit like of them and commit so you can ship on time sound familiar so the actual problem ain always laziness on the one hand the customers patience ain endless on the other hand most customers just don care whether your software is kb or mb so there you have it ah and for you joel spolsky fans out there ask lotus when they first shipped version it required an computer which wasn very common then they delayed the product by months while they worked to shoehorn it into the memory limit of the by the time they were done microsoft had month lead in developing excel and in great karmic joke the was obsolete anyway http www joelonsoftware com printerfriendly articles fog html

it seems to me that the problem must be that the confiscation and subsequent redistribution was poorly managed cannot say see it as grievous historical wrong to have wealth built on slaves back be redistributed to benefit said slaves descendants at large of course it is better when it does not have side effects like starvation on slightly different note find the white people mentality from white people to be quite ludicrous if someone non caucasian can be bothered to differentiate oh well but really truly do americans have much more of cherished brotherhood with russians danes estonians italians serbians albanians portugese and georgians then they do with malaysians koreans japanese kenyans and egyptians define myself primarily by my ethnocultural background and find being grouped in with white people to be on the offensive side there are lot of specific white people find quite distasteful and reprehensible and number of mostly caucasian countries whose general trends would characterise likewise being included with white people really feel puts me in some bad company expect have more meaningfully in common with quite lot of non caucasians than do with hordes of cacuasians not of my own ethnocultural background so unlike most people it seems reading about white farmers having their land confiscated does not arouse the least bit of emotion in me mostly because white farmers the way read it really stands for well to do descendants of wealthy owners of african slaves and my ancestors going back at least millenium almost certainly did not own slaves of any sort and couldn possibly have owned african slaves due to details of history and geography so these poor poor white farmers are nothing like me though may be caucasian and elicit no fraternal empathy from me whatsoever sorry for the long rant but it irritates me that there seemingly was an expectation that the description would elicit an emotional response and it irritates me that from many it does even though the most meaningful thing they have in common with said farmers is skin colour

they are upmodding it probably because mugabe is fashionable to hate as little hitler even or perhaps especcially by people who are oblivious to most details and facts about him and or his country on humorous aside the fact that he actually has hitler moustache does not help at all is he unaware or merely unconcerned with the parallel
details and facts are of little consequence in your world aren they

not if they want to die people have different utility functions to most people pain has negative utility but to masochist or mystic it might have positive utility to most people life is desireable in the balance of things the utility sum or the expected utility sum later in time turns out positive but if all there is in front of you is unhappiness dissatisfaction generally speaking negative utility states then yes dying is good thing
no insight can be gained from such short article journalists especially brittish media are very keen on pointing out mugabe shortcomings what they will never point out if how much the economic sanctions are harming zimbabwe here more balanced view http www newzimbabwe com pages sanctions html once again it seems to me that the west isn concerned about democracy and the welfare of the people rather it angers them that white farmers of european descent have been destituted from land that in effect was stolen land was it not do we expect colonial ownership and heritage in mean for real mugabe is scum but such biased journalists on payroll are scum too there an agenda here watch out when you read such reports on the western media get the fact from different angles
usually mod up dupes where the first one is really old like this one but mod down dupes of stories that were posted in the last day or two
the reason the article deserves to me modded down is that it is very short biased and uninformative

you re absolutely right when you comment on this use of the terminology white farmers it is terminology either specifically designed to spur empathy or at best coming from someone who has very little respect or concern for the specific historical issues that revolve around the issue either way it just debases the journalist who employs such terminology in fact ironically the ones who do use those terms are just agreeing with mugabe own distorted hypocritical and demagogical point of view and manipulation tactics

perhaps when they talk about the subject at hand yes but often times they are incorrect in spite of their knowledge of given subject mainly because facets of that subject are interjecting in larger context and the nerd seeing the subject he recognizes assumes more authority than is wise good example is how many nerds openly wonder why software tool language application isn used by everyone everywhere the nerd might be an expert in such case but he is ignorant of the fact that different people have different needs and maybe some people just aren interested in it note this also applies in fact quite readily to normal people where their political convictions are involved

how far can they take it before people as whole get sick of terrorism in my mind automatically reject anything that uses terrorism as an excuse because if accept it that means terrorism is working now if we need program to beef up security because we find it lacking lets do it examine the issues at hand and not use the word it just seems like the more they do these media blitz things the more obvious it becomes that they are just trying to control the country with fear the sad thing is that many not all fox users are actually succeptable to this it is just making me sick how much terrorism is working many americans are living in fear and the government is just faning the flames
was pronouncing it mu torrent until the article pointed out that it was micro torrent also an idiot micro clearly makes sense
okay so this article is too simplistic even if it shares the view that mugabe is very bad man assuming you don like sanctions what are our other options to paraphrase matt welch http mattwelch com old html economic aid suggests we implicitly support what the regime is up to see egypt indonesia humanitarian aid allows the regime to continue to neglect its own people when the aid itself doesn get stolen see nigeria afghanistan trade legitimizes the regime and gives it financial lever to use on us opportunity for large corporations to profit from the repression see saudi arabia china economic sanctions make the situation worse military attack iraq iraq iraq iraq iraq really the less said the better doing nothing we can just sit here while they kill or brutalize thousands of people are we racist monsters see sudan rwanda bosnia

regardless of if hugo chavez is saint or satan he is largely portrayed in the states as nutcase who solidifies his political popularity in venezuela by regularly embarking on anti us diatribes the middle ground moderate portion of the us electorate are the sought after ones since voters of the right and left are pretty much entrenched in the politics of perception truthiness foreign leaders who rail against the one home country automatically raise the defensive flags and are an anathema to be associated with politically like it or not politics are all perception and that wouldn be such bad thing if the average citizen perception ran deeper than second soundbites on hour news stations

well think qualifying the redistribution of historical slave owners land as stealing is deceptive at best delusional at worst is the us government stealing when it makes use of eminent domain it may be stupid cliché but it true if the government is doing it it legal assuming they had modicum of foresight with recent legislation buldozing houses for fun probably not his finest hour but it rather seemed to me like dumbly orchestrated aid grab did he fully reject the un tents or did he cave in eventually as for starving half the country that malicious lie his government policies whether heavily influence or solely guided by him had the unfortunate side effect of causing food supply problems presumably he did not confiscate the farms of the white people in devilish plot to starve the black people anyways rafuzo it seems to me was merely reciting the soundbites from some media establishment of about fox news level of reputation welcome new information about zimbabwe if am wrong am wrong but when government officials and media start foreign government or leader actions in order to make it him her look immoral or evil well when person is really evil you only have to tell the truth to get people to agree with you it is when there is plentiful moral ambiguity that governments need to start making up stuff to sway the masses in the intended direction

hmmmm perhaps you are right and there is no way to come out smelling like roses but it not like zimbabwe is killing or brutalizing people surely there is some difference between white farmers becoming poor poor people losing housing some lots poor people having increasingly less food available to them and racially ethnically motivated murdering and raping of your own people in fact not many of the countries you mention are in particularly the same league zimbabwe seems pretty harmless by most of the comparisons you implied personally would argue for non intervention mixed with sensible levels of aid and trade you cannot impose order from the outside it must come from within if people are being oppressed they must rise up that is as true in zimbabwe as it is in the united states of course western countries dislike genuine revolutions because the resulting governments tend to treat them with well earned distrust but it really is the best way on the long run think genuine revolution that succeeded in paving way to new and stable state is historic triumph coup by minor faction funded by foreign money however is source of national shame whether hidden or widely known

it might not be ok but it still useful to understand that dog aggression and human aggression are are not significantly correlated behaviors must people instinctively and wrongly assume that they are apbts are also not bred to try to inflict the maximum amount of damage on an opponent they are bred to grab and hold this makes lot of sense when you look at the rules surrounding an organized dog fight if apbts were really bred to do maximum damage they would try to bite many times and in many places and traditionally bred apbt simply won do this see the apbt faq for more details about organized dog fighting http www nyx net mbur apbt html the faq also provides lot of other interesting information about the breed and quick note about bite stats zak pointed in an earlier post to the the excellent find the pitbull page http www com petbull findpit html it not hard to understand why so many pit bull attacks are wrongly attributed to the breed if you re really interested in the subject you might also want to take look at bandit dossier of dangerous dog by vicki hearne it good and interesting read in it she does bit of investigation into number of pit bull attacks and it actually almost funny what breeds get transformed into pit bulls for the sake of more captivating newspaper headline it also probably instructional to stop by your local spca and take look the number of apbts and apbt crosses represented there many of the dogs that end up at animal shelters were previously abused so it not hard to make the inference that there are lot of abused apbts out there don mean to suggest that making generalizations or acting on them is bad thing it just human thing and one of our most important distinguishing cognitive characteristics and it useful ability but it also gets us into lot of trouble it what leads to statements like muslims like blowing people up or black people are dumb we simply need to make sure we think clearly about how we arrive at the generalizations we inevitably make and about the consequences of acting on them
you are absolutely right capitalism is such stupid idea think the government should just seize all private property nationalize all industry and redistribute the profits of all the greedy corporations to all the truly needy people we all know that government does much better job at just about anything than private industry

about fifty years ago people in america misread all men are created equal as all men are equal this is similar mistake as the one made in russia in which has led to similar but more ghastly problems outside of america one of the things that had to get fixed in order to make everyone equal is to get rid of the word man and substitute gender neutral word like person anyway as result if all people are equal then all points of view must be equal as no point of view exists independently of person if all points of view are the same then all cultures are the same culture is nothing but collective point of view the outcome is there is no longer any notion of facts or correctness or best as everything is equal there is just morass of equality where since we can all be superior and some of us can even be mediocre we all have to be bottom of the barrel together but don tell anyone as it may hurt someone feelings until we are no longer afraid to admit some people are actually are winners and some people are losers just as some people are taller shorter fatter thinner smarter dumber we will never get back to making progress this is obvious as progress implies something is better than something else and better is word being struck from our vocabulary

regarding your comment on languages that are purely which seems to be reference to haskell often described as purely functional should point out that haskell is not limited to purely functional programming paradigms it is for instance great for imperative programming the core language itself is pure but can be used to construct imperative computations naturally using sequential syntax that will be familiar to imperative programmers as bonus the type system ensures that you don accidentally mix imperative bits into computations that you intend to be pure so you can be pure and impure in the same program using each approach where it makes sense all while being assured that neither side of the program is muddying the other for example implementing concurrent port scanner is real world kind of problem that is by its very nature highly impure and yet it can be solved elegantly in haskell http blog moertel com articles concurrent port scanner in haskell in sum the line between purely and not purely is rather easy to cross and not as strongly separating as many people seem to believe cheers tom

indeed politics is perception and if people see second soundbite on tv showing how chavez is giving heating oil to poor americans think they ll have positive perception of chavez even if they are moderates that why chavez doing this was so brilliant he helping people who have been forgotten by their own country and the even though the leaders of that country seem to have it in for him
in venezuela the people own the oil resource under their feet what wrong with that nobody says they can make profit with that resource on the world market and they are since that resource is considered part of their national treasure they all get to share in it what wrong with that model it not applicable to everything of course but for natural resource like oil it quite applicable and it failry commonly held view outside of the us

we have the same problem where live we have sudden influx of people coming from eastern europe looking for better life it obvious that these immigrants are honest genuine people it still hard to face the uncertainty of what your neighbourhood is going to be like in years it may be the best thing that ever happened or it may be disaster one things for certain it will be different
guess my point was that it was idiotic and disprovable to suppose that the private sector somehow managed to exclude incompetence and ineffiency through the magic sleight of hand of the free market regarding railways and water gas etc they are clear examples of natural monopolies and the only reasons to put them in private hands are ideological superstitious or simply corruption doubtless the real reason imo

yes what reddit really needs is for link bookmarked while using frames to not be made unusable when the submitter deletes it its happened to me already
even if did agree with you that shirts with slogans should be permitted in the gallery the fact that they aren permitted is not an example of severe curbing of free speech in this country
in the second century of the christian era the empire of rome comprehended the fairest part of the earth and the most civilised portion of mankind the frontiers of that extensive monarchy were guarded by ancient renown and disciplined valour edward gibbon the decline and fall of the roman empire
think being thrown in jail for hours is severe perhaps you like to try it and report back whether or not you agree
there is no prohibition against shirts with slogans on them that nitwit is the point the police apologized for tossing her in jail

want concept theme filter not site filter that may be hard so keyword filter might be ok too zippit cant do it alone would like more people to do it and keep it isolated in one place in the ui for quick scanning at the moment comments bounce up and down as determined by time of last post in thread
what also seems bit crappy is of the determination of self discpline is based on parent and teacher questionaire would have thought most parents teachers think their kids are not self discplined if they don get good marks so its bit of circular measure bet previous high marks correlate very well with future high marks
on an entirely personal aside like to point out that really appreciate your comments on reddit imagine we disagree on many of the various controversial issues but never feel that your comments are childish or reactionary reddit doesn have space for personal communication so ll take this one google you but rah isn googleable

it would be very interesting to see how site content or even post title relates to mods many sites are using tagging as course categorization on content and spider scraper might be able to come up with relatively quick way of sorting posts into buckets the site itself technorati digg and even del icio us would be obvious sources of this information don know how bad form it would be to query your competitors for information on given link but such sites are designed for querying they wouldn be public otherwise the next questions to ask is how do you effectively group tags into more general groups that are suitable for presentation on new post sites like this you could almost predict how user would mod based on tags url themselves and previous performance which might be good way to utilize the recommended page on this site anyway enough brain storming for now
who better to make your decisions than someone you elect

hmm thought on modding buckets and karma perhaps you have user like myself who enjoys technical articles and tends to mod them up ignoring the other stuff let say see an interesting title on post that talks about knitting irish wool sweaters visit it like it and mod up the post ve effectively participated in modding set of links wouldn normally be concerned with shouldn that weight the score for that post instead of modding up point perhaps it should go up two the catch is that it not my decision how much weight it receives so now you have two points of data for the post mods up and down and weighted score

thanks can pay you much the same compliments though we very definitely disagree on many things also recall some unexpected points of agreement it is most gratifying to note we can be mutually appreciative of one another even despite our sometimes adversarial contacts thank you for your encouragement despite my semi regular disparagement of reddit modding modders actually paranoidly believe developed dedicated group of anti fans who seek out my comments in anticipation of disliking them but unlike you and other interesting sparring opponents instead of replying they just mod believe this not because of any diagnosed or undiagnosed medical condition but because occasionally find comments of mine downmodded that contain not shred of opinion only readily verifiable facts at any rate est la vie just hope comment modding won soon start having an impact because that would as you probably well know pretty much remove me from all discussions await with immense curiousity how this comment will be modded in comparison to my other comment and in comparison to your equally off topic though shorter comment just because you re paranoid doesn mean they re not out to get you
if the situation wasn so sad you be funny maybe you should move to zim for few months and tell us what it like afterwards lots of wide open spaces there have look at nelson mandela view on mugabe mandela expresses anger at mugabe http www namibian com na netstories may africa da html mandela adds to mugabe pressure http news bbc co uk hi world africa stm cosatu the largest sa trade union and part of the anc alliance are absolutely anti mugabe they recently blocked the border between sa and zim now don know how familiar you are with the political setup in this region but this should give you some indication of how the workers perceive him have look at zimbabwe lessons for south and southern africa http www cosatu org za speeches zv htm he confiscated white farms almost as smoke screen to hide his other attrocities behind think said this elsewhere but these days you get bill in zim for two reasons else you need something larger than wheelbarrow for your cash and to avoid an arbitrage situation developing with toilet paper it is literally cheeper to use zim dollars than toilet paper
as complement see above have dumbed down thing called linkr which works with ezproxy databases and some opacs http linkr org charles
agree if they were really concerned about democracy and destroying tyranny they would have bombed mugabe before they bombed sadam if any western eastern leader did what he done and forget about the stolen farms and there would have been international outcries had any middle eastern country done it they would have been bombed and invaded and here have to exclude israel there are special rules for them the fact that it happening in africa means that the west can really give damn the only reason anyone in the west knows anything about mugabe is because of the confiscated white farms had it been black farms they wouldn have given it second thought sad thing is the farm issue is the tip of the ice berg
speakeasy prices http www speakeasy net home compare sure they re posted basically mo activation for the slowest service premium if you want onelink meaning dsl without getting phone line via your local carrier and it mo bump to the next speed level then mo bump and another mo bump not extremely attractive compared to slightly faster service from your local bell if you can keep your bill less than have paid less if gone with speakeasy sbc always manages to surprise me with the monthly bill
the first link you posted is practically void of content mandela opinion is of no consequence to me unless it is well reasoned and in the article you linked there really isn any reasoning sorry not part of the western nelson mandela fan club which reminds me too much of the western dalai lama fan club the second link points out that on at least one thing mr mugabe and mr mandela agree guess what it is the very topic this article is about gt mr mandela backed equitable change to land ownership in zimbabwe where of the land is owned by whites the last link god that man goes on and on perhaps you could highlight specific sections of relevance for me the general gist of it though is that everything happening in zimbabwe is terrible well the general gist of it is that from what reports he receives in south africa things are terrible are there any media sources you could direct us to that shed light on events something with more details instead of just quotes of celebrity africans
as south african have to absolutely disagree with your views on mandela had it not been for him south africa would have seen an extremely bloody civl war all of us owe him our eternal gratitude saw the man in action saw the effect he had on white and black alike he is one of the only true hero of the past century read long walk to freedom by mandela and to get view from the perspective of the then ruling class read the afrikaners by herman gilliomee mugabe started off as one of the greatest liberation leaders of his generation no one knows why after years of rule he suddenly changed would really like to know if there is anything less ego centric behind his actions as for the rest of your post think you re trolling
what is happening brucewarne you keep telling us we know nothing why don you make point form list of the things you attribute to mugabe here let me start you off from what recall nationalising media outlets silencing political oposition through both non violent and violent means although the violent means are not always directly government applied how many alleged victims of violent silencing there are would be relevant to know confiscation of white farms mishandling of confiscation of white farms causing starvation and other economic suffering through mismanagement of white farm confiscation program what else should mention very much agree with most of you post except for the part where you advocate the bombing of zimbabwe but then would rather my nation endure yet another century or two of tyrrany it presently does not face such than to have barbarians destroy and desecrate the land and material accomplishments of my ancestors both direct and national do not claim moral superiority but that is how feel
don troll if we disagree we disagree there are individuals very reverently worshiped in my country as well who on closer examination are far less worthy than the average person attitude would suggest but maybe mandela is one of the few genuine heroes of incredible virtue out there don know
rah sorry to destroy your illusions was in zimbabwe in with my brother and his girl friend we traveled through southern africa south africa botswana zimbabwe and zambia because we wanted to see the eclipse in zambia in hwange national park we had our first encounter with mugabe in the form of three meter feet portrait in the entrance room this alone disturbed me which kind of people do really like huge portraits of themselves anyway we befriended camp guard in the national park during our stay in zimbabwe we ran out of gas in vic falls and were forced to buy it on the black market so the crisis on the supply markets was already showing the zimbabwe dollar had already high inflation rate we tried to keep in contact and the letters we received are getting worse and worse no maize meal no tourists coming etc after year sent money in letters this is not western union land the contact finally broke because some letters disappeared and martin wasn even able to buy stamps from my viewpoint the tribal structure in zimbabwe isn so much problem but was only one week there so my views of mugabe is quite negative
comrade you mean doubleplusgood comrade
rah sorry have to get some work done here can we continue this debate later google for mugabe site za for more info or go live there for while yes the west only gives attention to the man because of his confiscation of white owned farms in south africa however he gets coverage for what he does to blacks free press in zim is all but dead so unfortunately you can really expect to get an unbiassed zimbabwean view on the situation you either get views from zim journalists who have been deported or from those who are working for the government
you are right modded it up primarily because think it is fostering interesting discussions
brucewarne am in no hurry to finish our debate would appreciate though if you stopped telling me to move to zimbabwe we both know it isn going to happen surely that fact does not preclude me from being able to intelligently reason based on available data and the move to zimbabwe comments as well as some of your other comments make me wonder whether you are trying to arouse white man guilt in me have no white man guilt as noted in another comment of mine on this page find being generalised as white man rather offensive my ancestors were not and my national was not one that participated or benefitted from african exploitation am not beholden to my african neighbours any more than am to other people the same skin colour as me nor am automatically fraternal toward or prejudiced against either group if misinterpreted you apologise and please do not take it personally just wanted to make sure we are on the same page on this point ll look at some zimbabwen stuff as can find it on google tomorrow hopefully it will provide me with some additional insight have good day at work

somewhat sadly ve had to give up on dsl up until few years ago had provided by my then employer sweeeet but then they decided they wanted to charge me month for the local loop not so sweet that pretty cheap for but not cheap enough to make it justifiable expense just for the upstream bandwidth and other advantages over dsl or cable so used cable modem for few months as quick fallback then got dsl it was pretty decent only went down couple of times during the years we had it was fast as the on downstream and we could cope with the upstream well enough that we didn move our web sites off of our server at home but when we moved recently and the dsl was moved things went south quick for several weeks it didn work at all then they sent somebody out from covad and he did some rewiring and it sort of worked for little while few days then started having to reset the modem every day and it was slowwww when it was up eventually we found out that we were just too far from the co to get reliable or fast service so relunctly investigated cable modem service found out that our local provider charter has business service with mbps downstream twice what we got with dsl and kbps upstream same as what we got with dsl with static ip that you can run servers on freely for mo and you can get it in your home if you know who and how to ask this is not an endorsement but the service works well enough for me ve only been using it for few months though the point is though that the lecs or at least sbc now called at amp again need to get their acts together if they want to beat out the cable companies if they can provide dsl to somebody living in house in very affluent medium density neighborhood in major suburb of significant city that is not in any way semi rural out in the boonies then they are doing something wrong in my book

there is prohibition on protests and demonstrations on the capital grounds it seems that the capital police has now decided that tee shirts are not protests as they first stated ok they ve changed their story ll support them either way and defer to their judgment even so the expulsion of sheehan and young does not cause me to worry about free speech in this country in the gaza strip armed gunmen took over some eu offices because of political cartoon the newspaper in denmark that published the cartoons has received bomb threat arab countries have withdrawn ambassadors which of these two situations is better evidence of intolerance of free speech

well have noticed in my life that once patiently applied myself to things had never considered that could ever be any good at and had avoided having anything to do with for that reason made much more progress than would have thought possible for example had never so much as touched piano until my son and daughter started taking lessons so began helping them with their lessons doing it with them within few months having only practiced few hours week was playing pieces would have thought would take me much longer to learn am sure paul graham when he makes assertions like they get suprisingly far is drawing on personal experiences in which he tackled subject out of necessity and was suprised at how far he got in reasonable time am also pretty sure in comparing notes with other people the he noticed he wasn the only one to notice this he then puts the observation in an essay and it resonates with lots of people now that is hardly double blind study if that was what you were looking for but it isn as if the only useful things we know are what we learn from double blind studies observing patterns in one own life and comparing notes with others is think how we learn quite bit of our practical knowledge

like much of what he says but have some fundamental issues with the mapper packer distinction as just too simplistic the funny thing was when realized was mapper in some areas but packer in others most people are the less interested am in subject the less likely am to expend the energy to create map my curiosity has few limits but my energy does if can get by in subject of which have no permanent interest by learning just enough by rote to function will do so further packing has its advantages in some cases creating map at least for me usually ties into the emotional system witness hacker who cringes at ugly code ve seen teachers who can map through the entire theory of teaching and of their subject but can associate concepts on computers notice that they love teaching but have no interest in learning any more than they have to about computer this is conditioned response in school system the teacher who knew their way around computer ended up with additional unwanted found mapping and packing as useful constructs of information gathering but much less useful as personality trait

umm maybe wasn clear the fact that some people want to censor some cartoons doesn make the us bastion of free speech by comparison_ principles by definition are not relative that is nothing to do with seeing the world in black and white terms quite the opposite

you could just know not post comments dissing every article posted here or dunno make point every now and then or something
all the people you listed have style that makes their writings often come off as the absolute truth true as critical thinker however it is your job to filter out any biases and extract any useful information and insights is that too much to ask
first let me go on record that as libertarian have serious problems with much of what bush has done that having been said the headline is yet another instance of someone making things up for their own purposes from the article prime minister blair responded that he was solidly with the president and ready to do whatever it took to disarm saddam notice the word disarm you don talk about disarming someone who you know has no arms also from the article he bush went on it was also possible that defector could be brought out who would give public presentation about saddam wmd clearly according to the article bush and blair both believed there were wmds why do people make up things like the headline to the post above is it that they are part of the loony left and are desperately hoping if you repeat lie often enough someone will believe it or is it someone working on the radical right putting out postings to make the left look loony no matter what is going on it is harmful to the rest of the world events are hard enough to understand without disinformation being added to the mix

no don think so why
also have problems with what bush has done but the title of the article is the white house memo the article goes on to say channel news has seen minutes from that meeting what is this memo what are these minutes the rest of the article just quotes book by someone who was not at the supposed meeting nor are there any claims that the author saw any memos or minutes

correction months before the invasion days before going to the un my stupid mistake the point stands though
my old left wing college professors who want to believe this crap would blush if they saw it you need to go no further than his monetary blatherings to realize this kid believes what he saw on files few reasons why the administration won roll divisions into iran anytime soon domestically they couldn sell it unless an ayatollah was filmed sitting on some newly made nukes on cnn with promise to drop them on american cities folks may not have noticed but domestic approval ratings for the president and in particular the iraq war are quite low iraq is country of about people and are split into different ethnic groups and religious sects that love to hate each other though few want foreign troops to stick around most were happy to see saddam brought down iran has nearly times the population of iraq and are overwhelmingly of one religious sect and by most reports lot more cohesive than iraq occupying iran would entail numbers of us troops that would dwarf the iraq numbers as preemptive war it just wouldn fly politically whatever one may think the bush administration intent is they are working for stable iraq few viable conspiracy theories suggest otherwise going into iran would likely send the relatively stable shiite south of iraq into frenzy and would empower those attempting to destabilize in other regions too this is also why they will be hesistant to bomb specific sites or to let israel do so there are many other reasons but those are the big boys that come to mind oh yeah the bush administration won have any help for coalition this time hurry up and disagree with me feel it coming

the title says it all
didn claim the us was bastion of free speech in some sort of absolute sense according to your statement if observe that the situation is far far far worse outside the us then have no principles or morals because made that comparison if you choose to label the cindy sheehan incident as severe how to you label the cartoon incident as severely severe my original post and subsequent posts were trying to point out that using severe to describe the actions of the capital police skews the discussion such that it becomes difficult to make any kind of distinction because every situation is considered severe while would certainly agree that there are free speech concerns in the united states the situation can hardly be called severe within the larger global or historical context can the situation in the us be improved sure but it is much much much better than most of the rest of the world including much of europe

what bizarre and interesting article but why are the articles in this magazine so long
now that sneaky posting an article on reddit that on its turn links to list paul graham and guy kawasaki articles hmmm
my hope is that you are right but bush approval ratings can go lot lower and remember that he lame duck so who cares if he furthers the neocons agenda don think it would start out as war but as air raids the ugly iran iraq war of the was stalemate despite the fact that the us backed iraq whether or not they are working towards stable iraq the simple fact is they underestimated what it would take to occupy iraq for years lot of this article is over hype right now but if it gets to the point where bush decides to do bombing runs of nucular facilities escalation could follow no doubt drawn out war in the west of iran and an escalation of war in iraq would be awfully profitable for cheny friends and you are assuming that we understand all of the neocons motivations
for those of you wondering the website he talking about is http www world tracker com it only works in the uk for now though the website says they have plans of extending the service to the us

it even easier to track someone phone than he makes out in the article you don even need physical access to person phone if all that person has to do is reply with locate or some other canned response then all someone has to do is use prank text message provider which allow you to send sms messages which appear to come from any number you set obviously that person will still receive the original messages from the tracking service but most of them will probably think it spam virgin in the uk are the only network not providing tracking data to companies like this scary stuff
the cartoon is clearly offensive to muslims and should be apologized for give me break the uproar caused by those cartoons show how the sick and radicalized sections of islam actually speak for the muslim world at this moment how can cartoon in denmark cause such problem mean how messed up in the head do you actually have to be to give crap about something like that we have our beliefs they have theirs we believe in freedom of press they don if that causes them offence big deal

could you please explain the concept of offensive to me people seem to use this word to suppress all kinds of things from sex or violence in games movies tv to parodies satire and other political or anti religious content from my perspective it looks like offensive is term always used when there are no real objective arguments why something is bad usually the content in question is just bad because our tradition says so which is not the best argument to have especially when advocating strong measures like censoring of the free press

gt half of americans already support war with iran right now according to poll released feb maybe you took the poll yourself cause sure couldn find it anywhere provide link gt at the very least there is real possibility israel will be helping in gulf war the us provided israel with patriot missile batteries the us insisted begged israel not to retaliate when saddam dropped scuds on them saddam hoped to pull them into the war for that would have made it nearly impossible for the arab governments in the region to maintain their support the hatred of israel is one of the greatest unifying factors in the region in the current iraq war you will find no israelis around they would be very helpful but there was very conscious decision to keep them out of it do your homework also with respect to few of the european governemnts that initially contributed troops to the current iraq war spanish government tossed from office italian government about to be tossed from office british government took major losses in the recent election europeans electorate as whole more opposed than ever gt what they want is access to oil puppet regime to them is just bonus points if this is true believe it is much more complicated than just oil then they need stability to get oil out production in iraq still has not reached the pre war output numbers besides this by looking at their actions post invasion you can discern that they are working for stability regardless of the often moronic mistakes they make in attempting to do so

morality is relative there are certain things that you would surely find offensive that won attempt to name not going to defend the controversy around the cartoons because to me they re just cartoons and don care about them or religion but if you re suggesting that there are no grounds to being offended perhaps you need to revisit your own views of morality and see if there isn anything that is or could be offensive to you as it stands am hearing your argument as am normal what is taking something too far for you is not ok what is not that someone else thinks is has no grounds you are not normal or at least are not the measuring device from which to judge the justification for everyone else sense of right and wrong from paul graham has an interesting piece of writing titled what you can say where he discusses the taboos we have in western society now and how in the future we might find those taboos ridiculous censoring

gt according to your statement if observe that the situation is far far far worse outside the us then have no principles or morals because made that comparison not at all you used that comparison to make the point that the us was tolerant of free speech this is bogus argument imo and it could be used to justify almost anything you may not find it worrying that somebody is arrested for having statistic printed on her shirt but to me it the sort of thing we would criticise in country like north korea the fact is that the us is seen increasingly as threat by the rest of the world partly due to these kinds of incident
agree that it does seem bit simplistic wonder if maybe the value of making the mapper packer distinction so strongly comes from that it puts them in such high contrast yes map and pack and here was presented mapping concept meta mapping with which to think about it and even vocabulary with which to discuss it my map has grown of course many mappers around here will have thought about these things before and recognize these concepts mapping appears as tendency and one can realize that they have only small portion of universe mapped and that they have many flaws in what they do have realistic map of their map the map is not the territory one spends good deal of their life working so would hope that one would put good deal of energy and emotion into engaging with that work or finding some other type of work more engaging not bothering to have map of prime time shows does not make you packer the programmers stone defines packing at one point as socially conditioned conventional thinking certainly conventional thinking can get you through conventional day but being conditioned it would be difficult to toss it aside to solve non conventional problem so to the point using mapper packer just to label things or people seems like packer activity mapper can use mapper packer as launch point for thinking about things
uhh my contention is that english could die today as spoken language and still rank among the most influential languages ever it is already one of the most widespread languages in history and about quarter of the world speaks it at some level of competence the demand for english skills in the other of the world is very strong and does not show any signs of subsiding just yet it has exerted influence of unprecedented breadth on other languages trend which again does not show any signs of subsiding just yet english is the language of science about of the world scientific papers are in english latin never had the same distinction believe as it had to share the field with chinese greek and arabic and later on english in the face of this it would seem useful for you to clarify what would qualify as getting into the big leagues of accomplished languages http www britishcouncil org english engfaqs htm
with regard to the blathering my dismissal comes primarily from his summarized in the quote the only thing that keeps the dollar afloat is that oil is traded exclusively in greenbacks rather than some other currency like the motivations behind the neocon push for war in iraq the reasons behind the dollar strength is much more complicated then oil being primarily traded in dollars that said don think there is any doubt that it derives much of its importance strength from being primary currency used in international commodity transactions it will hurt the dollar if main producers of oil begin selling their goods in other currencies however alienating the us is not good idea for the oil producing nations particularly since the is the staunchest oil hog out there and has long maintained unholy alliances with countries such as saudi arabia as long as they play along these regimes generally need the consumer more than the needs them europe will turn on oil long before the will not to mention europe won lead military charge in defense of oil producing nations as the has see gulf war went looking for some links and spent most of my time reading the plethora of links that concurred with the one you posted there are good points and believe bit of merit however not enough merit to override the realities of invading or even bombing iran ll continue to look for what believe to be more realist link as soon as get done reading through the monetary conspiracy theorist libraries of links that are strangely addictive

this isn about free press censorship of it is about not being allowed to get out the true story to people this already doesn really apply to columns as they tend to be fictional and this this is the funnies section fer pete sake don play it my rights victim because that not central especially since such national things don quite apply the same internationally rather reminded of tourists that are arrogant enough to not adapt to or even to learn even just the important rules of the country they are in despite that how they stand legally and pretty much morally as well but like that doesn apply to things made somewhere and judged elsewhere however these things aren funny aren constructive criticism and are in general just negative so aren sensible the reaction is bloody large and little inrealistic but consider that they may think this is representative of the way we westerners think just as they may think that all americans are people who just want to conquer people with different views on life thought myself sometimes entertain that not much of conceptual stretch even and now everyone turning look they re offended by some pointless cartoon that don even really get myself into see these are the violent people we need to protect you from sure they re kicking up large shitstorm about something they could condemn and ignore and that not helping their case but it not like no one else around here is capable of that

it funny how the whole article looks at how things are different now but doesn talk much about how the changes are also making things worse we may be making more money as nation but the wealth divide is growing don think that necessarily bad thing as long as people aren starving but the home ownership numbers are going up even as median wages after inflation are headed down the question is whether or not the unravelling housing bubble will take the rest of the economy with it
some comments are quite insightfull
certainly national advertising campaigns are typical benifit of franchises that you couldn have in model like this that could be drawback these franchisees would really only need to advertise in their local communities and online for google local etc no doubt but aren there other benefits to be had from franchising aside from advertising and would they still be enough of benefit to create such network of restaurants maybe cooperative is better model than franchise series of restaurants pool some of their resources to hire out services they can all use but then don know much about cooperatives so maybe ve got that wrong

one of the most intelligent comments regarding the danish cartoon outrage was made by the fromer editor in chief of the jordanian newspaper shihan jihad momani gt who hurts islam more foreigner who excels in depicting the prophet or muslim with an explosive belt who blows himself up at wedding party source http www bangkokpost com breaking_news breakingnews php id mr jihad momani was removed from office immediately after he published this comment and some of the cartoons he had to apologize for it since then the fact that the same people whos religious feelings react highly sensitive to danish cartoons remain largely passive when terrorists misuse the name of god to motivate their crimes is not enough discussed in the media

approval ratings will change chaotically during the runup to such an invasion which would be logistically impossible to set up without the knowledge of the electorate air raids have not lead to war more often than they have lead to war see about escalation no they thought the war was over and declared victory when plans for the baathist insurgency were just getting underway hence the weapons caches all over the country the large numbers of guerillas with established hiding places and saddam tactic of releasing his entire prison population just as americans were getting close to baghdad

einstein supported socialism http www monthlyreview org einst htm not communism he supported socialism because he opposed the kind of bureacratic centralized planning inherent in capitalism where few major corporations plan how most of the economy is used he writes gt the achievement of socialism requires the solution of some extremely difficult socio political problems how is it possible in view of the far reaching centralization of political and economic power to prevent bureaucracy from becoming all powerful and overweening how can the rights of the individual be protected and therewith democratic counterweight to the power of bureaucracy be assured
the fact that the same people whos religious feelings react highly sensitive to danish cartoons remain largely passive when terrorists misuse the name of god to motivate their crimes is not enough discussed in the media don know what the situation is in the media in islamic countries but in the uk and us media this point is made constantly on radio phone ins tv discussion programmes the editorials and columns of major newspapers and most other high profile current affairs contexts can think of it correct and well made point of course but if there liberal conspiracy to deny this point it very poorly implemented one

this cartoon was published in the italian paper la stampa in http watch windsofchange net pics jpg caption reads don tell me they want to kill me again you might remember that it provoked fury in israel and in jewish groups worldwide imo correctly it vile piece of work if you think one was worth an apology and the other wasn it worth spending some time constructing careful argument as to why incidentally la stampa also reprinted the mohammed as bomber cartoons

scarfboy says rather reminded of tourists that are arrogant enough to not adapt to or even to learn even just the important rules of the country they are in despite that how they stand legally and pretty much morally as well the same would apply to those muslims living in denmark they need to adapt to their adopted homeland and become danes that means dealing with the fact that denmark is liberal constitutional monarchy that guarantees everyone the right to speak their minds if that means that someone is going to make fun of muhammed then the danish muslims can complain they can demonstrate or they can go piss up rope but they do not have the right to demand that no one can mock their religion and have something of an interest in this since mocking religion is one of my favourite pastimes

they weren trying to censor cartoons and they certainly aren in the business of reprimanding cartoonists it bad headline with the specific intention of misleading the reader firstly the headline doesn say that they were trying to censor the cartoonist nor does it imply that so not sure why you re using that as evidence that the headline is misleading secondly they most certainly were reprimanding the cartoonist suggest you look up the word reprimand if you honestly disagree thirdly in the business of is commonly used phrase merely indicating the concept of doing no reasonable person with native understanding of english would interpret it literally as used in the headline fourthly and most importantly yes the joint chiefs are entitled to their opinion and to expressing it but no they should absolutely not be expressing their personal political opinion in their official capacity as the heads of the military especially in an attempt to put chilling effect on criticism of the government this wasn merely guy and think what you said is wrong this was the heads of the most powerful military on earth explicitly calling attention to the fact that they are such and explicitly speaking in their official capacity as such criticizing political opinion if you think that the claim is that the problem with that is legal one you are sadly mistaken edited to get italics right instead of lt gt italics lt gt reddit support common html dammit

most fascist and communists regimes are oppressive and unpleasant indeed and by saying an idea is not responsible for its followers one is saying that the value of an idea is irrespective of the people who implement it thus restricting civil and property rights and treating political criminals like chattel as the canons of fascism and communism profess is not considered the source for totalitarians rounding people up into cattle cars and shipping them to siberia or auschwitz sorry don buy that oh and incidentally you yourself use false analogy in suggesting that most muslims aren suicide bombers which is true enough but beside the point and while we re beside the point ll note that while people often rightfully criticize christian fundamentalists for being extremists caricature of jesus results in far smaller percentage of adherents chanting death to country of origin of caricature that most of the middle eastern european muslims are protesting and burning flags in the streets over some crude drawings speaks very ill of islam in general no matter how many of those protestors would actually kill someone

pica the founding fathers were very careful in crafting our nation to explicitly not let the majority opinion decide how decisions were made our system is republic representative democracy not pure democracy if they wanted pure democracy they would not have limited who could vote and restricted what they could vote for our founding fathers were familiar with history and knew about the failures of athens and rome and tried to build system that would be safer from the corrupting forces of power and the mob in your post above you yourself appear to hold two contradictory positions that the mob should rule and that the the constitution law should those two never jibe there have been plenty of cases where the majority of americans are poorly educated enough that they want things enacted fortuntely our founding fathers were much more subtle then you in their analysis of how to make government and run it so they rejected mob rule and embraced the rule of law the internments were not just morally wrong they were actally which is why we paid inadequate reparations side note have distant family that lost several hundred acres of farmland in southern california which the government then resold while they were interned that land is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars my family members and their close kin got nothing they were american citizens they paid their taxes and were as supportive of the war as anyone else but they were put in camp and had everything stolen from them because of the color of theis skin we should all do what we can to prevent that kind of anti american activity from occuring again
alright that it we are detaining all muslims until we can somehow expel them via constitutional amendment if necessary have some questions about this can you tell who is muslim by looking at them can you tell who is muslim by dna testing them if muslim rejected their religion in this ethnic cleansing scenario would she be released from the camps if muslim wore green star and agreed to have all his communications monitored would he be released from the camps would children of muslim parents also be interned in the detention camps or would they be separated from their parents would you have to be practising muslim or would coming from an arab american family and attending mosque occasionally do if you think the majority of americans would be in favour of policy of mass detention without trial and religious persecution would you describe their opinion as completely bugfuck
when you have people singing pop music about killing jews and children being taught by their elders the usama bin laden is hero and that if you die while killing infidels you ll get virgins when you go to heaven then you are seeing culture of hate and death think you re describing palestine and iran highly publicised and exceptional cases in the middle east you may be aware that less than of muslims live in the middle east these pathologies aren exactly common in russia india france or the uk can say with absolute confidence that the majority of this enormous number of people are threatening unbelievers and encouraging suicide bombing could you give some evidence that the majority of muslims in countries outside the middle east the other are doing this

frankly this seems like simple and rather rational response to me no one is claiming the cartoons were or should have been illegal for the sake of tolerance and good taste however they never should ve been published and in this case the publisher deserves every bit of chastisement they get they should be ashamed for their editorial yes monty python makes fun of christianity and that does offend some people but it also comes as predominantly christian culture making fun of itself and so it largely well taken it would be quite another thing if they made fun of muslims buddhists hindus or jews the other

question yes can you say anything about response or reaction to this uproar in europe over the prophet muhammad pictures do you have any reaction to it are you concerned that the violence is going to spread and make everything just mr mccormack haven seen any first of all this is matter of fact haven seen it have seen lot of protests ve seen great deal of distress expressed by muslims across the globe the muslims around the world have expressed the fact that they are outraged and that they take great offense at the images that were printed in the danish newspaper as well as in other newspapers around the world our response is to say that while we certainly don agree with support or in some cases we condemn the views that are aired in public that are published in media organizations around the world we at the same time defend the right of those individuals to express their views for us freedom of expression is at the core of our democracy and it is something that we have shed blood and treasure around the world to defend and we will continue to do so that said there are other aspects to democracy our democracy democracies around the world and that is to promote understanding to promote respect for minority rights to try to appreciate the differences that may exist among us we believe for example in our country that people from different religious backgrounds ethnic backgrounds national backgrounds add to our strength as country and it is important to recognize and appreciate those differences and it is also important to protect the rights of individuals and the media to express point of view concerning various subjects so while we share the offense that muslims have taken at these images we at the same time vigorously defend the right of individuals to express points of view we may like said we may not agree with those points of view we may condemn those points of view but we respect and emphasize the importance that those individuals have the right to express those points of view for example and on the particular cartoon that was published know the prime minister of denmark has talked about his know that the newspaper that originally printed it has apologized so they have addressed this particular issue so we would urge all parties to exercise the maximum degree of understanding the maximum degree of tolerance when they talk about this issue and we would urge dialogue not violence and that also those that might take offense at these images that have been published when they see similar views or images that could be perceived as anti semitic or anti catholic that they speak out with equal vigor against those images question that the muslims speak out with equal vigor when they see that what you re asking mr mccormack we would we believe that it is an important principle that peoples around the world encourage dialogue not violence dialogue not and that when you see an image that is offensive to another particular group to speak out against that anti muslim images are as unacceptable as anti semitic images as anti christian images or any other religious belief we have to remember and respect the deeply held beliefs of those who have different beliefs from us but it is important that we also support the rights of individuals to express their freely held views question so basically you re just hoping that it doesn sorry misspoke when said there was violence meant uproar your bottom line is that both sides have the right to do exactly as they re doing and you just hope it doesn get worse mr mccormack well question you just hope it doesn escalate mr mccormack gave pretty long answer so question you did trying to sum it up for you laughter mr mccormack yeah sure question couple of years ago think it was couple of years ago when think it was the syrians and the lebanese were introducing this documentary about the jews or it was the egyptians this administration spoke out very strongly about that and called it offensive said it was mr mccormack just said that the images were offensive we found them offensive question well no you said that you understand that the muslims found them offensive but mr mccormack saying now we find them offensive and we certainly understand why muslims would find these images offensive yes question one word is puzzling me in this sean and that the use of the word unacceptable and not acceptable exactly what that implies mean it not quite obvious that you find the images offensive when you say unacceptable it applies some sort of action against the people who perpetrate those images mr mccormack no think made it very clear that our defense of freedom of expression and the ability of individuals and media organizations to engage in free expression is forthright and it is strong you know this is our first amendment rights the freedom of expression are some of the most strongly held and dearly held views that we have here in america and certainly nothing that said would hope would imply any diminution of that support question it just the one word unacceptable just wondering if that implied any action you know but it doesn you say mr mccormack no question okay mr mccormack yes question do you caution america media against publishing those cartoons mr mccormack that for you and your editors to decide and that not for the government we don own the printing presses question sean these cartoons first surfaced in late september and it following this recent election with the palestinian authority the eu mission was attacked or held in effect by hamas yesterday near gaza city and the tact of some of these european newspapers again are to re publish these cartoons is the election mood is this what is possibly fueling this and what is our media response to this la what katherine hughes may or may not do versus international state department and government media to the muslim world including indonesia asia and the middle east mr mccormack don think your colleagues really want me to repeat the long answer that gave to teri so refer you to that answer
the government has always insisted military action was used as last resort against saddam hussein regime this last resort claim made it so infuriating to read news in the lead up to the war as last resort the administration insisted that iraq produce report detailing all of its weapons and weapons programs this would be the only way for iraq to avoid war iraq complied but when the report failed to include any indication of wmds the administration used that as proof that iraq was not cooperating and that war was necessary obviously the report would have served as proof that war was necessary regardless of what was in it this kind of stuff pisses me off and no one even pays attention or holds politicians accountable except apparently in the uk

wonder what the policy on racist or sexist cartoons are for american newspapers
these things are not illegal nor should be or are called for to be but people seem to whine as if they were they were however in bad taste by just portraying negatively and having no point in the process the paper was probably right in saying okay that was little much sorry about that and this state department was probably right in saying yeah that was disrespecful without any point because it was and that most of the point by not making point it becomes thing indicating prejudice not criticism even charicaturing stupid stereotypes it not directly related freedom of the press freedom of speech nor surpression of truth this is the funnies section mild conjecture at best and inherently simplification sort of risky in any case it is not report of an event that is under threat of having its truth surpressed and no one threatened the danish to stop this or bloody else at least we call for tolerance does not sound like that to me but apparently it does to some maybe they should have been ignored condemned yes the response was over the top but that how offense can work perhaps how it usually does work
shiva not shakti
there is large difference that was meant in fairly good faith as constructive criticism mixed with some deconstruction of some ideas that probably deserve good lookinh at and obviously humour it done in relatively good taste so is for example dogma which pokes plenty of fun at christianity but does so with fair respect and clearly more knowledge of what it is criticising that most viewers have and doesn charicature much beyond the need of condensation into actual characters the cartoon has just faith that it wouldn stir up shitstorm not necessarily bad but it hardly comparable in any way
that is unrelated to said and little moot many ideas are arguable against however people are held responsible for their actions not their ideas that how morality and legal issues work see your quarrel with my argument but it just doesn make much sense in the end it like calling religion hateful because there are quite few fundamentalists to every major religion including christianity islam and more on the whole and at the core neither approve in any real way of this polarized crap that has been happening as of late we should remember that
yes and that makes them the violators eh it an abstract point anyway not so imporant actually was just trying to point out it just too convenient to blame large group just because you don know many details it actually damn arrogant when it stupid akin to me denouncing any and all americans because their current govenment is doing some rather questionable things it would be stupid and it would be about the same thing usually it is by far the minority that encourages strong violence and it is the bulk that buys into that it is necessary guess you have fair share of the opinions of that bulk the bulk on this side anyhow no it not one of peace but that not the point thing is the largest part of the small group of people with real antagonism that to the point of action are those against control occupation specifically those that are being controlled and what more annoying for some people to hear they have some point yes they re going about it badly but so has america recently which in some way goes to skew suggestions about intention to play eye for and eye purely in the realm of the blame game is just trying to rationalize shit but getting annoyed now and that not doing my writing any good night all
yes realized it shortly aafter posted fix it if could sorry
actually need no that bit too strong it continually debated question whether immigrants should be forced to abandon all their values since that inherently means some degree of saying your culture sucks ours rules do it or else we kick you back out yes they should definitely keep to laws know how societry and the system of morality of everyone around them works speak the language and such things but beyond that requiring much would be assimilation that is often not warranted for any real reasons and is form of arrogance as well no they cannot demand no one can mock their religion but that is nation agnostic nationality agnostic and just basic moral point if you re going to mock people publicly and on large scale do it with point and carefully that didn happen in this case and it that that primarily mind but it seems people here have like to polarize and that means get grouped into haters of freedom instead of people questioning extreme points made generally quantizing the discussion into very twitchy directions sigh

asking questions is an obvious thing that many smart people fail to do but something his article did not go into more depth about is why smart people don ask questions this is problem in our educational system we are taught to know the right answer and not to think our way to the solution there was an article couple days ago about teacher using the socratic method to teach students binary math believe we could become much more productive as society if our children were introduced to subjects by asking thoughtful questions that lead their minds in the correct direction for the topic

as see it think in many cases it useless to give up television if you re like me and you do happen to ponder the idea of giving up television you most likely replace it with something as equally time consuming and pointless the internet think going to take the opposite extreme going to combine all of those time wasting pointless activities and do them all at the same time god bless multi tasking that evolution provided us that right television im ing internet surfing video games music listening mail checking cell phone talking and cell phone texting hedonism at it best screw being productive member of society

quit my tv addiction freshman year of college my roommate and didn have tv its liberating not to schedule your life around tv of course now there is tivo but wonder if that makes it worse for people since now they have more shows they have to watch but no excuse to limit their choices
one of the most pernicious effects of the television in my humble opinion is the extremely short snippets it operates in they shorten my attention span and somehow that really tends to make me unhappy perhaps because my mind just starts flickering around in an evolutionary what wrong kind of manner the rapidly changing pace of the flickering screen is really disturbing if you re more used to things like reading books
the author has point but don see it as problem of islam the problem is with the general concept of religion it just surfaces more obviously in the countries where religion does have more influence

that what keep telling my boner
violence is common reaction of fundamentalists whatever their religion there are lot of fundamentalist muslims for various reasons but in part because it is the policies of the united states since the as we promoted islamic fundamentalism as an ideological tool to use against both progressive nationalism and communism we originally promoted very extremist reactionary form of islam in saudi arabia to help foil communism and nationalism we trained the taliban in afghanistan to serve as foil to the soviets we even trained osama bin laden himself and supplied him with money after the cold war ended the ideologies we were providing foil against essentially disappeared and fundamentalism filled the vacuum much to our dismay am not saying other factors were not involved am just saying that we helped to create the sorceror apprentice that has now gone out of control fundamentalist christians do not use violence as much an muslims right now thanks in no small part to the efffectiveness of our western societies in maintaiing respect for the rule of law and tend of promoting liberal democracy that finds violence abhorrent all the same christians in the us have in the name of religion blown up abortion clinics murdered abortion providers murdered gays and threatened violence againt those whom they disagree with the extremists in the christina identity movement in the us have killed police officers committed bombings plotted number of terrorist attacks fortunately virtually all were foiled by the fbi and committed many hate crimes they just don get lot of news coverage by the liberal media in the us politicians are courting them and promoting policies that help them grow and thanks to bush we are funding their programs going into speculation land expect that there will be breaking point at some point when there is lot of tension in our society for instance when fosil fuel becomes scarce or when environmental changes become more sever where fundamentalists in the us that will take even more control and their violence will grow
you re saying that creationists jump on this because it seems lot more irreducible than the human brain in other words it is easy to see slightly dumber brain being useful than to see slightly worse roach brain surgery being useful rubbish you re just not being very creative you know how slightly worse roach brain surgery is useful for immobilizing the roach while keeping it alive so that the larvae can enjoy its warm entrails even if you can move the roach where you want it to be this is still pretty good you know an even worse roach brain surgery is useful for killing the friggin roach delete your incredulity from your mind these things only seem incredible because we can understand millions of years multiplied by billions of cockroaches and wasps each of which was novel evolutionary experiment we just can as side note the article makes this brain surgery appear much more incredible than it really is it not some delicate microsurgery that directly modifies the escape reflex it shooting venom into the brain to destroy whole chunk of it resulting in mostly docile being if you ve read about lobotomies you ll know that those resulted in mostly dull docile human beings and that jamming an icepick into the frontal lobe

would highly recommend this to everyone myself have not watched television on anything even remotely like regular basis for roughly three four years now still watch few shows occasionally but not television rather via downloading them through peer to peer network the end result is that have lot more time in this world can watch the shows like on my terms when want not when they re on thus am not bound to any external schedule do not have to waste time watching commercials and only follow shows that are critically acclaimed and not whatever junk happen to surf by the internet beats television for news and entertainment
however those cartoons make hypocrites of arabs who say we should not offend religions
suspect blood in marketing video isn going to help sell power tools
there are pro violent and pro pacific pieces in the bible sure the same can be said for the koran violent people will use whatever they can to justify their actions or to convert others to violence
as already said in another thread koran is the literal word of allah the word of god is unquestionable bible was written by humans hence it can be questioned and re interpreted this makes lot of difference
haven watched television in years but ever since then ve simply surfed the web instead debating whether ve gotten anything out of that
some countries consider banning operation in the male style
sure the same can be said for the koran can anyone offer links to support this any quotes from the koran along the lines of love your enemies do good to those who hate you
koran is the literal word of allah so you say what if said that muhammed made it all up or that he saw and heard what he said he saw and heard but it was because he was stoned we don really know if the koran is the true word of allah because we only have muhammed word that it is and he been dead for more than thousand years it in the same category as the book of mormon joseph smith said he was given some golden plates by an angel that had god word written in some language in order to read them he needed to put them inside hat and look at them with special stone there great episode of south park about it all about mormons that everyone should check out
as late as the th century the koran was open to interpretation too averroes wrote famous treatise about islam and science where he said that if the koran appeared to conflict with scientific fact then the common interpretation of the koran must be wrong don understand how it works today
yep just buy dvr and you are game
am not christian or muslim and regard both as mythological world views from long ago that were successful because of their justification to systematically reject and wipe out other mythologies both the bible and the koran have passages that can be used to justify violence come not to bring peace but sword in the epistles in the they describe killing an early christian for charging interest on loan the old testament contains many bloodbaths perpetrated by the protagonists with yaweh egging on the slaughter and rebuking those who show mercy or compassion since his described goal is for the israelites to conquer various lands he decreed to them and slaughter any who stand in the way but both the bible and the koran have passages that can be used to show that they are religion of peace you have cited some for the bible in the koran there are many peaceful and tolerant verses easily googled the idea of jihad is presented as the struggle within oneself to overcome one baser passions both books are awash with contradictions and inconsistencies which is real problem you can show that the bible or koran teach peach and tolerance but you can also show that they teach intolerance and rabid zeal in attacking those who do not believe as you do fundamentalists despite claiming that their book is dictated by god and is absolute truth never read their religious books seriously or critically they always pick and choose passages that justify their views whatever their religion fundamentalists foment in their followers fear alienation and anger and in their more extreme forms teach that extremism and violence in the name of religion are right

don stop with the book of mormon and the koran what about the new testament and the hebrew bible the bible as we know it went through many changes before the first protestant religion even popped up councils of old catholics fat off the selling of indulgences voted on what books should be in and what shouldn hell some of what became obscure apocrypha is probably there because certain contingents of bishops had food poisoning that day though sure god guided it all with an unseen hand oh and one quick question how come god doesn send colorful miracle working prophets anymore and why did they have penchant for showing up in times and places where documentation consisted of the generational word of mouth variety coincidence
gt think lot of people want to imagine that the arabs want peace because they want to imagine that arabs are somehow good people where good implies peaceful like the danes don imagine one way or the other in all fairness your making the assumptions not me know the muslim faith at this moment has been hijacked by extremists but what don know is how many normal every day muslims actually support them this atleast in my case is impossible to find out gt think that incorrect if the arabs wanted peace they use gahndi strategy to win don know where to start refuting that statement how about gandhi united one country the muslim world has so many different leaders with different agendas it would be next to impossible for one person to unite them also in palestine case many countries and peoples looking for peace go about it the wrong way gandhi was an exceptional guy practically unique in his success trying to tell people that are being killed and persecuted that peaceful protest will work is very hard sell

is qujibo muslim that believes that or is he just trying to state the muslim position when read his comment my first reaction was that he was doing the latter
there is fundamental difference between the koran and the bible where as the bible speaks of the life of jesus in the new testament and mostly about how you as an individual should behave the koran and the additional books on the ways of muhammed go beyond that and set rules for not only the individual but also law amp punishment and government amp state and even economy by islamic faith the words in the koran are set in stone because they are the words of god him herself there is no changing the words of god and herein lies the problem as the world changes islam as religion can change muhammed and his followers where more or less nomads living in the arabian peninsula thousand years ago maybe the laws for the individual and society worked back then but not in the st century know this might sound provocative to some of you but think for the sake of muslims and fellow human beeings islam as religion must learn to change and to let go of many of the old traditions

one little thing wish to point out here it quite telling that this publication is using the poisoned term pirate in reference to what these litigious companies are doing they are casting an aspersion on legal activity frankly expected bit more objectivity coming from an entity associating itself with mit think these patent pirates are fabulous conclusion to completely broken patent system by hitting large companies right in their pocketbooks we will finally see some needed changes in the patent system our well lobbied representatives in congress will make sure of that
gt the bible as we know it went through many changes before the first protestant religion even popped up councils of old catholics fat off the selling of indulgences voted on what books should be in and what shouldn hell some of what became obscure apocrypha is probably there because certain contingents of bishops had food poisoning that day though sure god guided it all with an unseen hand umm the bible was canonized in at nicea well before the whole indulgence problem popped up in the catholic church it also wasn just matter of voting in what you liked and what you didn they had very strict set of criteria for what would be accepted and what wouldn apostolic origin attributed to and based on the preaching teaching of the first generation apostles or their close companions universal acceptance acknowledged by all major christian communities in the ancient world by the end of the fourth century liturgical use read publicly when early christian communities gathered for the lord supper their weekly worship services consistent message containing theological outlook similar or complementary to other accepted christian writings there was also the problem of several apocrphyal books being blatantly wrong in their account of history believe it is judith which lists nebudchadnezzar is king of the assyrians which obviously is not true historically gt oh and one quick question how come god doesn send colorful miracle working prophets anymore you must not look very far because there are many people who claim to be prophets though for many of them their claims are questionable they certainly are colorful though also in third world countries miracles are much more of common thing maybe we have become so inundated with the material that we cannot see the spiritual any longer gt and why did they have penchant for showing up in times and places where documentation consisted of the generational word of mouth variety coincidence say again
very important attention
have not read all the comments about htdwyl yet but will soon here my two cents htdwyl was imho written by an individual who possesses extraordinary insight into the process of living compare his insight to that of maxwell maltz who developed psycho cybernetics if you ve read that is saying lot htdwyl could maybe be further developed into practical approach about how goalless people like me could discover worthwhile goals in maltz never talked about how to engage in goal setting per se he just assumed that you had goal or goals and he more or less proved that they re necessary for fulfillment its impossible to deny his logic and wisdom but many people simply don have them for whatever reason lack of goals doesn mean you re lazy incompetent or anything like that it just means that you have interests that are sufficiently varied to preclude intense focus on any particular one and maybe focused people are just autistic in different way do we have to have goals no we exist without them obviously but having one or two important goals must be very good feeling wish had that feeling most of the time guess should get back to painting my kitchen its pm as type this paul graham did mention discipline as recall rdeegan sbcglobal net write me
dilemma decent article but must vote it down on principle title in all caps you know
what interesting is that in other statistics of this nature that ve seen the ease of starting business corresponds strongly to the strength of the economy note also that this means how easy it is to do business rather than how social taking care of the less fortunate broadly country is both anglo saxon model countries as well as the nordic countries score well here in italy instead it very difficult to start business as you can see from the stats you have to have significant amount of money already to do it so it is beyond the reach of many people the social model here is also imo suboptimal in that there aren many benefits for the unemployed or poor but instead it hard to fire people so that the burden is shifted to corporations who are forced to pay for people they don need rather than say being taxed as in the nordic countries so that the government fills that role or as the society sees fit simply let people take care of themselves as in the us of course that gross but think it interesting to look at each one and see what works and what doesn
gt both the bible and the koran have passages that can be used to justify violence come not to bring peace but sword you might want to go back and read that in context christ was not condoning violence nor telling anyone to use it he was simply saying that what he taught would be extremely provocative and would turn others for example communities and families against each other and he was correct gt in the epistles in the they describe killing an early christian for charging interest on loan you took this out of context too you are speaking of the classic example of ananias and sapphira now man named ananias together with his wife sapphira also sold piece of property with his wife full knowledge he kept back part of the money for himself but brought the rest and put it at the apostles feet then peter said ananias how is it that satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the holy spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land didn it belong to you before it was sold and after it was sold wasn the money at your disposal what made you think of doing such thing you have not lied to men but to god when ananias heard this he fell down and died and great fear seized all who heard what had happened then the young men came forward wrapped up his body and carried him out and buried him it has absolutely nothing to do with charging interest on loan as you claim and nothing to do with any human killing someone else you really twisted the story there gt the old testament contains many bloodbaths perpetrated by the protagonists with yaweh egging on the slaughter and rebuking those who show mercy or compassion since his described goal is for the israelites to conquer various lands he decreed to them and slaughter any who stand in the way you ll find those bloodbaths never occured to an innocent nation that did nothing they occured when other nations attacked israel first particularly when they the israelites were in state of vulnerability gt both books are awash with contradictions and inconsistencies which is real problem ve still yet to find someone who can find honest contradictions most of the time it has to do with the person taking the passages out of context like you did in your above statements gt fundamentalists despite claiming that their book is dictated by god and is absolute truth never read their religious books seriously or critically they always pick and choose passages that justify their views whatever their religion fundamentalists foment in their followers fear alienation and anger and in their more extreme forms teach that extremism and violence in the name of religion are right that was quite the generalization listen have no problem with you being critical of any religion just be honest when doing so blatantly twisting stories to make your point is not being honest

gt don imagine one way or the other in all fairness your making the assumptions not me know the muslim faith at this moment has been hijacked by extremists but what don know is how many normal every day muslims actually support them this atleast in my case is impossible to find out why do you say its been hijacked their violence is no different than that of muhammad and the immediate muslim leaders that followed him over the next years
what do you propose they do they are tiny nation that is surrounded by bunch of nations that hate them and regularly kill their people through suicide bombings and other assorted actions need remind you that israel didn even start doing this stuff until the entire arab world tried to wipe them out in that the kind of stuff they have to put up with on day to day basis your ethnic cleansing statement is way off and though the israeli government does take harsh actions it has to it can just stand by and be run over

when clicked on the comments link for this article braced myself for the worst slashdot style flameage instead find thoughtful and mostly polite conversation don know how much longer reddit will stay like this it would be marvellous if it were reddit design that making this happen if the flamers hold back because they know they ll get modded down into the sub basement that probably too much to hope for but this page at least at this instant shows how great it would be if that happened
not saying peaceful protest would not work think it would but you have this idea that west christian countries would act differently under the same circumstances which in my opinion is wishful thinking and not reflected in history also if talking about palestinians don say arab say palestinian gt that why they don just exterminate the arabs be hoping they don do that because it would be inhuman and go against the teaching of their faith
given that modern day israel was once the home to several million palestinians none of whom are there any more it is the most thoroughly ethnically cleansed piece of land on the planet ever wonder why the war happened quick peek at the realm of historical fact reveals that close to two million palestinians were dispossessed and removed from the lands homes they owned they held deeds during the creation of the israeli state no one felt bad about this at the time because europe had just finished attempting to wipe jews off the face of the earth so merely cleansing two million people from mandate palestine was ok if it helped recompensing for million who had been killed
in what way is his ethnic cleansing statement way off from what ve heard the palestinians literally have deeds to large amounts of land in what is now israel and the current government won let them back in because the government could then no longer be both democratic and have state religion isn this so
to say that christians are less violent is certainly matter of perspective let not forget that the christian nations of the world also possess the biggest most lethal and well organized militaries this has been true since the days of the emperor constantine by immeasurable orders of magnitude war is far more violent and destructive than any other act of human violence all of the deaths and property damage caused by terrorism in the last years combined cannot come close to the violence of even one war while some christian individuals may turn the other cheek they also fund and condone extreme violoence through their war machines muslims do not have this avenue for flexing muscle and their dismay carries little weight in the world perhaps it is their position of relative weakness combined with the lack of any effective means for expressing dissatisfaction that is the catalyst for violent reactions or rhetoric

pretty funny just don get the whole mouse head joke or why they call southeast asia microsoft factory microsoft is software obviously besides the xbox think they should rename it wal mart factory
think the reason the israelis don mistreat the palestinians more is not just that they re afraid of losing support in the rest of the world but that the country itself is divided in addition to the extreme zionists there is silent majority who see all too clearly the parallels between how israel treats the palestinians and how jews have been treated by oppressive governments in the past couple years ago when the israelis were killing large numbers of palestinians cabinet member even spoke out against it saying that the things he was seeing reminded him of the warsaw ghetto
silly me started to think wouldn upgrade for couple of years
the author fails to consider that people are thinking individuals if when the seat is left down is dependant upon the time then surely the people involved will try to alter their behaviour so that it benefits them not sure whether this would help or hinder or tho but in race condition it makes sense for to go first in the morning however would try to change her daily patterns so she tended to use it more in the afternoon if this occured the the distribution is not random anymore and perhaps the time of swapping should then be increased to pm also considering that should have some benefit for giving way in race conditions
the bible doesn condone what they did its very obvious by the danites own theivery and use of idols that what they did was wrong via the ot laws of the time there the danites set up for themselves the idols and jonathan son of gershom the son of moses and his sons were priests for the tribe of dan until the time of the captivity of the land they continued to use the idols micah had made all the time the house of god was in shiloh that the thing about the bible it records the good and bad portions of israelite history and thus some people take the bad parts and assume the bible is glorifying those acts when it isn doing that as much as being an accurate depiction of history
gt and the current government won let them back in because the government could then no longer be both democratic and have state religion israel does not have state religion infact much of the government is composed of secular jews
apologize in my mind associated ethnic cleansing with genocide though the two are not synonymous but really when you at it isreal policies aren that different from those of many other modern nations ever since the us really got into the idea of nation states stuff like this has been going on in czechoslovakia yugoslavia and several other nations where entire people groups were relocated in order to establish nation for particular people group again understand what the israeli government does is harsh but its not as if they haven tried to make due with what more or less the un created after totally routing the arab attacks in they could ve kept those territories for long time but they haven and what do they get for trying to stand middle position and giving back the palestinians the west bank and gaza more violence so more or less israel is between rock and hard place israel realistically needed to be created due to the rampant anti semitism that exists throughout the world but now that they have created state they have to waver between keeping that state independent and being accomadting to their neighbors who more or less hate them its hard place to be
there are very many christians who believe that the bible is the literal unquestionable word of god that doesn stop them from reading only the parts they want to see

gt man you have got to find out little bit more about the social and political history of that region everything to you is about my religion is better than yours know quite bit about the social and political history of islam and there is no one who will deny that muhammad spread islam by the sword and that islam reached its peak through warfare not trying to say anything about my religion is better than yours just observing what happened in history
neither judaism nor islam has commandment to love thy neighbor in their holy texts there is hadith that reads none of you believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself but hadiths come from muhammad rather than god not to say that muhammad is fallible or anything there is also sufism which is an esoteric sect of islam with interesting and remarkable parallels to buddhism but some islamic scholars have dim view of sufism

gt umm the bible was canonized in at nicea well before the whole indulgence problem popped up in the catholic church no it wasn it went through many changes here link to university site timeline http www columbia edu cu augustine canon html the council of nicea was more about constantine having the new bishops solidify something for him to work with as he established the empire under new religion at mom urging if remember correctly believe the historical importance of it with regard to orthodoxy was that it spelled out the man god combo of jesus in the nicean creed they still recite that badboy at catholic services among others as it is permanently ingrained in my head after years of indoctrination that timeline and the texts was checking out only include what we know about the theological councils of the one holy catholic and apostolic church were likely more secretive then than they are now it looks like the big codification took place in response to that rebel martin luther who will admit had balls the size of coconuts with regard to the colorful miracle working prophets colorful was an adjective to modify miracle working curious why religions tend to have consistent theme of miracle working prophets that existed hundreds or thousands of years ago and had their stories passed on by word of mouth for generations before the first written accounts started popping up have you ever played telephone that game where little kids whisper in each others ear and the final kid compares his translation with the original take the innocent harmless aspect of the game away and then throw in the historical power politics that used religion to their advantage how about constantine and nicea for example then throw in the inherent human desire for higher power like to believe in christianity or even another loving religion but you see if god was gonna throw in free will as crucial tenant and then play the game of historical telephone then ll take agnosticism thanks
think you ll find that the anti semitic position was made very eloquently by the cartoons themselves anti semitism and disagreement with israeli foreign domestic policy are two entirely different things but some dissemblers try to muddle them up

ths is actually the user once known as moof after got back from movies and shopping today reddit somehow forgot my password and wouldn let me log in so created new account the and do have passages that can be used to justify violence but as said most of those that use them to justify violence are not reading the passages critically or seriously they are finding what they are looking for agree that in general jesus message was one of peace but the various writers of the books of the slipped in few passages that are pro violence and the bible itself is both contradictory and gives plenty of material for those who want to use it to justify violence luke and he said to them when sent you out without money belt and bag and sandals you did not lack anything did you they said no nothing and he said to them but now whoever has money belt is to take it along likewise also bag and whoever has no sword is to sell his coat and buy one for tell you that this which is written must be fulfilled in me and he was numbered with transgressors for that which refers to me has its fulfillment they said lord look here are two swords and he said to them it is enough if jesus is telling his followers to buy weapons expect jesus means for them to use them john when it was almost time for the jewish passover jesus went up to jerusalem in the temple courts he found men selling cattle sheep and doves and others sitting at tables exchanging money so he made whip out of cords and drove all from the temple both sheep and cattle he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables to those who sold doves he said get out of here jesus was hitting people with whip luke say to you that to everyone who has more shall be given but from the one who does not have even what he does have shall be taken away as for my enemies who do not want me to reign over them bring them here and kill them in my presence matthew do not think that have come to send peace on earth did not come to send peace but sword am sent to set man against his father daughter against her mother and daughter in law against her mother in law your previous interpretation is extra textual gen et al god is vengeful god exodus et al god is fierce warrior leviticus et al the spirit of god kills people ezra god is jealous and furious gal the fruit of the spirit of god is peace love joy patience kindness faithfulness gentleness and self control gen god himself sows discord proverbs god hates those who sows discord exodus children should and do suffer for their parent sins deuternonmy children are not to suffer for their parent sins gen on the first day god created light then separated light and darkness gen the sun which separates night and day wasn created until the fourth day gen trees were created before man was created gen man was created before trees were created gen birds were created before man was created gen man was created before birds were created gen animals were created before man was created gen man was created before animals were created gen man and woman were created at the same time gen man was created first woman sometime later gen there were many languages before the tower of babel gen there was one language before the tower of babel kings two and twenty years old was ahaziah when he began to reign chronicles forty and two years old was ahaziah when he began to reign samuel therefore michal the daughter of saul had no child unto the day of her death samuel but the king took the five sons of michal the daughter of saul in the there are two accounts of jesus genealogy which are contradictory matthew luke there are two inconsistent accounts of his death luke and when jesus had cried with loud voice he said father into thy hands commend my spirit and having said thus he gave up the ghost john when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost could go on for many pages with more examples of contradictions and justifications for violence in the bible the book is serious mess and really could have used few talented editors to clean it up we also have many outright errors in the bible kings pi is equal to three lev all fowls that creep going upon all four shall be an abomination unto you except that birds don crawl on all fours lev and the hare because he cheweth the cud more hare chewing cud deut as the camel and the hare and the coney for they chew the cud but divide not the hoof matt the kingdom of heaven is like to grain of mustard seed which is the least of all seeds but when it is grown is the greatest among herbs and becometh tree there are plenty of seeds smaller than mustard seed also mustard plants don grow into trees you are correct that misrecalled the details of the ananias and sapphira as was rushing through and while have read the and have read mark and john in greek it was while back so conflated keeping few buck for themselves with usury really am afraid that am not really interested in the bible these days so my memory of details is fading as for generalizing about fundamentalists would you say that the christian fundamentalists are really understanding the true nature of their religion when they murder doctors police bomb buildings when you read their writings and see their hate crimes do you not find fear alienation and anger if not what would you say drives people to murder their fellow men in the name of religion your notion that all the tribes that were slaughtered in the were somehow asking for it and that the slaughter even their children and animals is utterly abhorrent saying that the murder of children is acceptable due to their parent transgressions is beyond the pale

castro has locked away whole populations of people for various reasons in the case most familiar with from university he marched thousands of male and female prostitutes into camps to be reeducated after he took power apparently the revolutionaries felt that spending most of your life many cuban prostitutes were very young fellating rich foreigners during the batista regime caused one to be unseemly or undignified condition that only years of forced agricultural labor could cure interestingly undignified men were treated much more harshly than undignified women you almost think that all those good cuban marxists thought the men had committed some special sin or something you can draw your own conclusions about whether secular marxist humanism or the humanist catholicism it supplanted yes catholicism is indeed humanist tradition look it up are workable apologist ideologies for crimes against humanity oh yeah and if for some reason you think that castro doesn deserve to be on the list with mao million citizens killed and stalin million for killing only few thousand hookers he still got long history of imprisoning journalists suppressing political dissent you think anyone disses the state in cuba and confiscating his people property through engineered currency revaluations
can believe nobody questioned the premise of this headline yet don know very many muslims and none well but none of the ones knew were violent taken literally it absurd to say that muslims always or even usually resort to violence maybe the person who wrote that letter to the editor meant to say something else about the violence that we hear about in the news but it unclear to me what they were trying to say or why it interesting enough to show up on reddit

actually the vast majority of the much lamented bloodshed in the th century was perpetrated by atheists nationalists and racists honestly have religious fundamentalists come even close to these numbers military casualties wwi million more than all previous european wars military casualties in wwii million deaths due to mao great leap forward million deaths due to mao cultural revolution state terror million deaths under stalin engineered famine state terror million polish non jews killed by germans during wwii million jewish holocaust victims million non jewish holocaust victims disabled homosexual jehovah witnesses communists slavs russian pows roma million civillian deaths in russia wwii million russian military casualties wwii million civillian deaths in china wwii million military deaths in china wwii million deaths under cambodian communist regime million extermination of urban population deaths under vietnamese communist regime million deaths under various eastern european communist governments million deaths due to soviet aggression in afghanistan million deaths under north korean communist regime million deaths under iraqi baathist regime thousand none of the victims are of any particular religion unless you count the extermination of eastern european jews by nazis but then would think that the nazi campaigns against gypsies homosexuals communists jehovah witnesses russians ukranians poles slavs etc show that the animus against jews was at least partly racial as opposed to theological none of the perpetrators of these crimes were of any particular religion unless you argue that marxism marxism leninism or communism are religions hence none of these crimes have really been perpetrated by fundamentalists although they were definitely carried out by fanatics all of this is rather roundabout way of saying when you talk about the united states using fundamentalism as an ideological tool against progressive nationalism and communism or wax regretful over the many crimes of christian fundamentalists in the us or talk up the import of protecting the west from muslim fundamentalists in the persian gulf that we all have to keep these things in the proper perspective of course if you note the relatively small numbers associated with the first two items on the list you begin to wonder whether all the pap and sentiment we get on tv about man inhumanity to man shouldn really be phrased the state inhumanity to man really why not

you re certainly right that people who are sufficiently er motivated to think about killing people will also be motivated enough to look for justification until they find one or failing that make one up from whole cloth and don know lot about the bible but do think you re reading few of the passages above in the wrong light michel foucault the french historian and general po mo guy drew an interesting distinction in history between societies that were repressive and societies that were ideological the idea is that once upon time the easiest way to make everyone in given society behave themselves was to make all social decisions economic bad behavior was punished gruesome public torture the negative utility for breaking the rules was astronomically high even if it wasn likely you get caught the key point for this discussion is that the punishments were more intended for deterrent effect than they were to exact retribution eventually societies became too disparate and too specialized for repressive social structures to work any more so the ideological society evolved wherein we internalize society values and feel guilt we punish ourselves for thinking about crime and so only rarely manage to actually commit any ideological societies are recent development say maybe starting in britain in the mid the israelites and early christians were both definitely repressive which means that they viewed violence in fundamentally different way than we do that is setting unbelievers on fire or cutting off people hands for stealing were just the way an effective society was administered on the other hand political scientist would note that even in these enlightened times every traffic ticket and irs reporting regulation is ultimately collected or enforced by the threat of violence in fact we can even define the state as holder of the monopoly on the legitimate first use of force in given geographic area but we don really consider parking citations violent they re just something we have to keep our society in working order

yes the islamic culture was lightyears ahead of europe during the dark ages but that enlightenment happened mostly in the area of science and technology like mathematics the alphabet astronomy etc europe had its great thinkers like diderot and voltaire who started questioning god meaning of life and the individuals right of expressing themselves freely there was slow shift away from the mysticism of the dark ages that crippled thought the islamic culture started out great but has been at standstill or even moved backwards in the last centuries largely due to its intrinsic nature that the words in the koran can never be changed or questioned the laws affecting every aspect of society from politics to economy to individual rights mysticism strong traditions etc etc the world changes but islam has great difficulty changing with it however seeing what has happened in the us and europe the last few years the rise of christian fundamentalism makes you wonder if the western societies are moving towards another period of dark ages

teach algebra at an inner city school sure the kids don all know the multiplication tables but with calculators most of them can learn algebra more easily than they can the times table the hurdle is getting them to acccept that we can talk and reason about number when we don even know what then number is yet and that we can use letters as place holders for those numbers that not to say ignore remedial work on arithmetic but kids who ve had bad experiecnces for years at learning one thing often find it harder to overcome their resistance to what they know they can do than to learn something new and there no reason in the age of calculators built into cell phones that algebra absolutely has to wait for proficiency in the mecahnics of multiplication

gt president who lies under oath threatens our entire government as he gnaws at the roots of our democracy seriously you think that lie under oath did more damage to our democracy than the hundreds of lies not under oath of the bush administration during the lead up to the iraq war that doesn make any sense to me
with you there the president can absolutely be removed from office for commission of felony whether or not he should be removed from office is debatable if you think that commission of felony any felony including perjuring about adultery means that the country must absolutely have different president then that makes it sound like legality entails morality and sure you don agree with that can you break it down another way
this is indeed very old but sokal contention was that his targets danced back and forth across the line of radical subjectivity when it suited them

you missed word gt so google has concluded that bmw de is cheating by trying to be the number one natural result for searches on used bmws perhaps if the doorway page reflected the content or purpose of the actual site instead of trying to hijack search phrases then google judgement would have been more lenient gt gebrauchtwagen means used car in german how often does this word appear in the doorway page times entering gebrauchtwagen bmw into google yields it as top result

where the antisemetism please say what he said that is untrue we are talking about an actual event that took place in not your dishonest interpretation of the talmud you give jews bad name with your lying
it doesn matter if he muslim jew hindu satanist or guava worshipper clearly he has brain and is capable of reasonable discourse and yeah it just seems like he stating the muslim position which anyone who looks at the religion culture would know
and therein lies the root of his twisted philosophy give up everything good in life including life itself to dedicate your life to forcing others to do the same more purely evil philosophy could not possibly exist it is simply self imposed misery to spread misery by force upon others
all for the west standing up for freedom of expression loudly and however then the author blows his credibility with justification of colonialism in one particularly inane passage he states that british rule in india helped with famine relief it is generally accepted that it caused at least one famine http en wikipedia org wiki whatever the merits of islam or social democracy this author is merely looking for reason to announce that his own culture is superior
thought he didn say it was open to interpretation just that it described different reality there is the natural world and the world of the koran the koran when it doesn concur with the natural world doesn apply so the koran is still not open to interpretation it just concerns world that isn our world bit like string theory or some other seemingly unprovable system that quite talmudic no
yeah but that would be better rendered as love your jew neighbor as yourself the people of baal the cushites verkakte it is wrong to misinterpret the jewish religion as universalist religion of love it tribal religion for the jews
it slower than direct connections there is always price to be paid for anonymous data communication however routing in the mute network is based on technique called ant colony optimization aco aco is extremely good at finding shortest routes in network and also at patching broken routes so if node on data transfer route leaves the network mute automatically redirects data to the next shortest route also the mute network is zero trust there is no weakness like you have to trust your neigbour nodes or anything in my opnion the mute network is the most promising anonymous network it still needs work in some areas but it getting there there are several mute clients and most of them are not up to par yet am the author of kommute www kommute net kde mute file sharing client

there wrong assumption in there if john is living alone and puts the toilet seat back up after op the article claims this is inefficient behaviour it isn how often do you perform two op in row without an op in between say that event chance of occurence is so low it can be ignored out of rote once you get to cohabitation the article main gist this argument loses some steam
yeah we antisemites want to know what of the event did it happen or not for one figure the rabbinical court of jerusalem knows lot more from the talmud than you mobyturbo oh and for the record if the rabbinical court of jerusalem says it was good then by definition it was good you fake jews need to get with the program

this reply is just an example of the modern nazis who deny the history has it happend no one wiped million palestinians out of israel this is just lie for most there were not more than several hundred of arabs who lived under the british occupation the mandat in when the jewish people returned into the holy land there was an offer accepted by the zionist leadership which said that all the palestinians will stay in their towns and the country will be divided in much more pro arab way than anyone can imagine these days you should go and search in wikipedia about the un partition plan which was rejected by the arabs who preffered to start war against israel to make things short muslims have much more time to spread lies over the internet but whoever wants to know little bit more just run quick search in google and find some objective sites with information you will find that many things that you read in site comments are just plan lies in any case just look how every issue with arabs return to the israeli palestinian problem like denish cartoonist is related to israel what you don understand is that the arab jihad is coming towards you in really big steps and what seems now to be israel problem will hurt you in the near future btw go and search in google how many birth each muslim european woman gives and try to understand what is going to be your future in years from now

sure not saying that you can get certain optimizations over digraphs through random walks nor am saying that ant colony optimization doesn happen what saying is that aco has not been proven to map to the domain of message passing over small world networks with attributes of optimality or anonimity ants work reasonably well at food gathering but the problem of food gathering isn obviously isomorphic to the problem of message passing from the information you give there are obvious scalability issues as well as traffic analysis and potential active attacks by rogue nodes
haha so simulation of politics of sorts
they won give up their souls and they ll continue to play their new best toy ever while their mum washing their underpants greatly relieved that not all articles posted here illustrate the phenomenon
device sticks to car device sticks to car bores into cabin crawls over and sticks to driver
in anonymous rerouting networks there are always issues of traffic analysis and active attacks it all comes down to how powerful the adversary is in terms of network resources and the compromises made between speed bandwith usage and anonymity no rerouting network will ever be free of attacks if the adversary owns all other nodes in the network it is very difficult impossible to stay anonymous but this discussion is to lengthy to continue here aco maps directly to the problem of finding shortest paths in graph you are right that aco is not garanteed to find the shortest path however that is not important in network the scalability of mute is actually surprisingly good due to the adaptive nature of aco where data constantly migrates towards the fastest shortest routes this means that if node that is part of route is being swamped with data other routes might be faster and mute uses stochaistic model to keep less frequently travelled routes alive one of these routes may turn out to be faster and will slowly gain more traffic thus freeing the swamped node of traffic
and if it really achieved these speeds imagine it would be out of sight pretty quickly so it is even harder to control

atheists nationalists and racists what does atheism have to do with nationalism or racism can see how nationalism and racism can feed off each other but atheism and how is nationalism and racism distinct from any particular religion oh he not christian jew muslim he nationalist don lump her in with my religion she racist yeah this topic is being beaten to death think there are few useful points we can extract from all of the typing going on religions can be interpreted by people in any number of ways religion isn the only thing that motivates people to do things religions have in many cases books that say things that today we find both uplifting and repugnant having no religion is no protection against doing stupid evil things

no noticed that as well there seemed to be no contrasting argument for what adulthood was supposed to look like this make his argument seem heavily biased and selective in it choices of subjects to attack he also ignores the phenomenon of the last or so years of adolescents wanting to be adults before their time in the and the idea of being carefree immature teenager was greatly looked down upon in the you had to be smoking drinking and sneaking into rated movies by the time you were and in the early at any rate you had to be serious dour political activist who listend to serious alternative music and cried over the erosion of the wetlands by the time you were in middle school think some of the phenomenon he is witnessing might be related to this in that if people have no real adolescence they might get nostalgic for an idealized version of what they believed their teenage years were or should have been

very formulaic this reads like one of those new york times articles on how today women go to college to find husband with no supporting statistics and handful of misrepresented annecdotes the author is conflating several phenomena the rise geek culture where somethings buy toys because face it legos are cool the large adult market for video games odd but longstanding the tendency of european somethings to live at home unsurprising given high unemployment and the large number of young japanese women who live at home and refuse to get married because doing so would cost them their independence it not clear that all these phenomena are even related this sort of article is basically the college educated version of trashy tabloid news bunch of dubious stories strung together and coated with satisfyingly judgmental attitude

yow table saws are insanely dangerous know people who ve been very nearly killed by them and who spent months in physical theraphy and this technology fixes one of the two big safety risks the other safety risk of course is kickback of the wood which occurs when certain kinds of jams occur and the wood gets flung backwards off the table saw at high speed that why you always stand to the side of the wood
this reply is just an example of the modern nazis who deny the history has it happend btw go and search in google how many birth each muslim european woman gives and try to understand what is going to be your future in years from now replace the word muslim with jewish in this sentence and then read the first sentence again also for most there were not more than several hundred of arabs who lived under the british occupation the mandat yes several hundred how silly of me
it very much does have state religion non jews cannot naturalize as israeli citizens without converting many areas of israeli law are based on halkha and talmudic law israel single greatest problem is it inability to resolve secular identity with these and other facts that make non jews second class citizens if israel were to become properly secular jewish israelis may find themselves outnumbered over time and in the same position they were in europe early last century persecuted minority

this is why there should be no regulations on starting business this guy is actually producing his wonderful technology himself but who knows how many other people have had good ideas and didn implement them because starting business is hard and all the regulations favor established large companies who have head start and more resources the large companies don want to relinquish their market share and the government is just helping them prevent new and better technology from being produced
well at this stage it is still theory isn it technically but the word theory has different meanings in and out of scientific discourse for the average joe theory tends to mean some explanation dreamed up but in science there are conjectures and hypothesis and theories referring to something as theory means that it is pretty damn well supported it means there are repeatable experiments for verifying predictions and at least the possibility of demonstrating that the theory is wrong used in this sense the big bang may be theory but id is at best conjecture btw since theories are so easily dismissed should we now expect bush to ignore concerns over iran nuclear program after all relativity is just theory

so suppose dawkins is now joining the hall of fame here at reddit along with paul graham and others submit an article by him and see how high it goes anyway dawkins is awfully short minded if even viewing religion through darwinistic perspective he cannot see its benefits religion gives people hope and determination often that is all that is needed to help those that aren the strongest physically or emeotionally to continue on this of course is viewing it through an entirely atheistic standpoint personally see many other benefits to christianity ie talking to god but not everyone has that viewpoint and that okay with me the truth is dawkins has an extremely biased standpoint just as do dawkins set goal is to destroy religion he obviously not going to see any benefits of religion because he isn looking very hard for them anyway he doesn want to see them to him religion is an abhorance and something to completely avoid glad people like martin luther king didn completely avoid it
you re right
the toy is cool but the video isn it would be lot better with little editing and without the vapid background music

religion also creates society that accepts people that aren as intelligent as this guy do you really think it good idea to leave of the world population out in the cold for the sole benefit of the that can actually understand the humanist and scientific arguments for secularism doesn sound like very nice thing to do or very safe thing for that matter certainly recognize that organized religion is but its abolition would be too much for the world to take
programs that dont have to be installed just one easy download torrent
erm actually dawkins presents hypothesis about what the benefits of religion are in the article or more accurately the benefits of the psychological tendencies which lead to religious belief
if you read the article you see that pretty much what dawkins himself is saying
the argument for secularism is dead simple don belive in if there is no good evidence for in many countries for example here in the uk it fairly unusual for someone to have strong religious beliefs most people stupid people included get on just fine without believing in god
this decision will ultimately hurt yahoo and aol because their users will get angry when they don get their receipts and other such transactional emails from sites that refuse to pay an aol tax
the israelis claim quite big part of the orient because god gave it to abraham there was genocide when moses and josua came from egypt and reclaimed israel they were even punished for not killing everyone these are the parts don understand about god nevertheless believe jesus is my saviour but getting off topic genocide being routine is too much
well posted it because it is good and readable text not the st interview or news story about dawkins dawkins sees there is religion in the world and as scientist he tries to explain its existence within the framework he normally uses and that approach is interesting whether you agree with him or not
agree with you except that part where you say that someone must be punished for commission of crime there are many people who have committed felonies for which do not think they should be punished myself for example don think should go to jail for giving marijuana to my grandpa or for giving copyrighted music to my friends similarly don think clinton should have been removed from office for perjury about his adultery we might make different value judgment there and understand your point of view gt and if it is proven that bush did anything illegal he too must be punished he claims that the law does not apply to his actions so it impossible for him to do anything illegal if you do not accept that claim then he has admitted to doing several illegal things your statement is naive

gt and there is another facet to the liability issue if gt sawstop did come to market and was proved effective in gt preventing accidents it might be easier for plaintiffs gt to win lawsuits against manufacturers of traditional gt saws because juries might be more likely to return gt verdict against manufacturer that chose not to implement gt sawstop that the main reason gass believes that the gt big tool makers are refusing to deal with him they want gt his product to go away but of course it too late to put that genie back into the bottle even if the entire industry unites in an effort to refuse this technology that act alone could serve as excellent grounds for lawsuit from anyone who loses finger to saw

yes he says gt if am right religion has no survival value for individual human beings nor for the benefit of their genes but he also says that religions real power comes in groups but this isn true religion can give any individual hope or determination know some of the darkest times of my life got hope not through my church or some group of people related to religion but rather through my own experience it provided me as an individual with huge amount of survival value

gt believe you but how does that refute dawkins argument he just arguing that religion has no overall survival value for human beings to start off with what do you mean by overall if someone doesn commit suicide because they have found hope in religion that has directly had value to their survival or maybe someone is able to continue on with very important project of theirs because of their strong faith and that in turn leads to the survival of thousands again its very valuable just don know where you can come to the conclusion that religion has no surival value to humans in great tragedies or disasters often the one thing that differentiates those who die and those who live are those who didn give up and kept fighting if religion is one of those impetesus that keeps them fighting how has it done anything but help human beings to survive how many people survived in the gulags of russia or the concentration camps of nazi germany simply because they had hope through their faith you ever heard of corrie ten boom many people have but if you haven recommend that you read up on her her story she was jew in the concentration camps of germany would disprove dawkins idea in heartbeat gt you also have to consider the number of people who are made thoroughly miserable by religion how many people have been made miserable by progress assure you that there are some people alive today who would have been better off living years ago because their livelyhood wouldn have been them being relegated to factory where they do the same repetitive task for hours day for less than minimal wage just because some people are made miserable by something doesn mean that it has no inherent surivival value to humans

it is true that religion has an individual component that is not dependent on group interaction much like yoga or chess or reading it provides select individuals with sense of well being that they feel helps them in their lives dawkins acknowledges that this is the case as would most reasonable aetheists it is also true that when bunch of people who do the same individual religion thing get together the resulting groups are affected by their religion of choice like many group activities it does incredible damage to the world both in terms of waste of resources and in terms of specific nastiness like religious war every religion without exception has examples of bunch of followers getting together and going killing in the name of their religion some religions have relatively small number of such examples some like christianity and islam have hell of lot no honest religious person can deny any of this although many religious persons will say that the people who did the nasty things were not truly where is their preferred religion think the point of disagreement between you and dawkins is that you have different opinions of the relative magnitude of you feeling good because you have religion and millions dying in religious conflict
why do you think that you were presented with representative sample

dawkins actually argues that religion is side effect of useful characteristic of kids that they just believe whatever they are told arguing that science has been net negative for the world is fairly hard arguing that religion is net negative would be rather easier imagine incidentally it would be interesting to see if the survival rate of religious people in very hard circumstances is higher than that of the non religious if not then it begs the question why do anecdotes of non religious survivors not get as much attention an uncharitable response would be that religious people have little else to hype about religion in general but perhaps it is that religious things make better stories when richard feynman was dying of cancer he had no late conversion to religion he accepted that his death was the end of him and he met that death with dignity that we often associate with religious people why is his story not widely known perhaps it really is that religious stories tell better
that must be why no one is ever pressured to be straight these days why there is never violence towards gays and why there aren any states trying to permanently ban unions between people of the same sex oh wait of course people trying to demonstrate their tolerance have latched onto this movie but that doesn mean that it didn educate few people along the way also homosexuality does not take advantage of people who cannot defend themselves accepting homosexuality does not mean that we should accept lifestyles that do
gt no honest religious person can deny any of this although many religious persons will say that the people who did the nasty things were not truly where is their preferred religion don see why this isn valid explanation if christ taught love your enemies as yourself and those who live by the sword will die by it and someone who claims to be his follower does otherwise then they aren really following what he taught ie his religion are they

gt think about it the central question for dawkins is if person is born with psychological tendencies which make them credulous enough to become relgious will this increase their overall chance of survival dawkins answers yes to this question however there is second question does religious belief in itself increase the chance of person survival the answer dawkins gives to this question is no it doesn matter that some people have benefited from their beliefs the question is whether more than of religious people benefit from their beliefs so where are his stats to back this up if it comes down to percentage number gt fairly obviously you have to consider whether the advantages of being religious outway the disadvantages on average dawkins is quite reasonably suggesting that they don hence my remark that religion makes some people very miserable or even leads to their deaths again are his stats to back that up on average is statistical term it appears to me that dawkins is observing from his ivory tower and making statements that he isn really qualified to make its easy when you are sitting in comfy chair at home typing an article up to be read online wonder if dawkins has bothered talking to actual people about this subject to come up with some kind of relevant survey as opposed to making lot of statements without any real backing

in short whether killer follows christianity or not is beside the point if he kills in its name in long this is wonderful illustration of the single worst thing about religion highly contested superlative by any measure the religion can never be blamed for anything it always misguided followers of some other religion you say you are christian eric rudolph says he is christian you note that it says in book which you say contains the word of god that killing people which was at one point mostly ok became really bad thing sometime between ad and the widespread standardization of the bible you further note that rudolph killed people and that therefore you don think he should be considered christian rudolph begs to differ what to do there are few choices available here can decide that yes indeed you are correct and close textual analysis of your book reveals that this guy is not in very good concert with the main character of the latter part of your book should therefore call you christian and this other guy dangerous kook this has the side effect of making part of our language directly dependent on generation translation of transcription of bunch of oral history but no matter the problem here is that now who have no interest in religion have to referee for you religious types on who is what this is not so good alternatively can say that both you and he fit nicely within the current popular definition of christian and that english is defined not by etymology but by current standard usage can then leave it to the people who identify as christians to either get togther on what it means or to invent terms for themselves to differentiate or to police themselves there is an intriguing logical fallacy at work here you have set of values and people who deviate from those values enough are said not to be following your religion therefore by definition no one following your religion has ever murdered while it is regrettably true that some have temporarily strayed gone on murderous rampage and then returned to grace no practicing christian has ever killed soul think more honest way to define following christianity is to call it about the standard way if someone goes to church says they are christian and such then call them christian if they then do nasty things admit that christian did nasty things finally if they do nasty things in the name of their religion admit that they did nasty things in the name of their religion and consider that as negative to be weighed against the comfort you feel in dark times if bunch of agnostics started going around and burning churches mosques and synagogues because they didn want people worshipping would want to stop them even though there is no real agnostic group or identity it is interesting that the religious desipite their far greater cohesion do not seem to feel the same way

hum stats shall we start listing religious wars that were religiously motivated like the crusades or shall we instead start with more intra than inter state actions like the inquisition or perhaps we should stay more current like with the effects of roman catholic prohibition of birth control and its effects in latin america intelligent design terrorism in the us against abortion clinics economic expenditure on religious artifacts what your pick if all of that is just too close to home we can pick on other religions even dead ones so as not to offend
should have said communists nationalists fascists and racists instead used the word atheists because wanted to emphasize that religion had basically no part in motivating the vast majority of the crimes against humanity committed in the twentieth century which outnumber such casualties from all prior human history by large margin gt how is nationalism and racism distinct from any particular religion because it simplistic and misleading to say that fascist nationalism and communism are like religions when they and not organized religion are responsible for unprecedented level of organized brutality over the last hundred years all the really nasty murderous ideologies of late have been about focusing group hatred by encouraging people to give up their individual volition in the service of collective usually the state violent islamism the the first murderous self abnegating ideology can think of that substitutes religious creed for political state so it would be more profitable for us to ask how atrocity committing muslim hatred is like atrocity committing communist or nazi hatred rather than asking how muslim fundamentalists are like christian fundamentalists
actually it need not be the case that benefit it just needs to be net positive if benefit great deal and the rest recieve no benefit it is net positive interestingly if strategy helps you small amount but hurts others lot more at the same time it would be the correct choice for each individual particularly if the harm is mostly centered outside your immediate group perhaps more charitable way to respond to jesusphreak is that the stats are likely to be bad for his argument and that dawkins sees plausible argument for why credulity is good thing in kids but not necessarily good argument for religion being helpful in general

very good point ll remember that one thing forgot to note chez is actually among the slower schemes isn it this guy might have done better to use mzscheme which has truly excellent numerical tower
your headline is sensational and misleading compared to what actually in the story
this article does not indicate if the guy knew prior to powell speech that the info was wrong in other words is he saying he was in on hoax or that he was an unknowing participant guess ll have to watch now
this is the key gt was also told that while gimp functionality may rival photoshop how you get there is very different there no doubting that photoshop is extremely unintuitive to novice even moving around and resizing layers is bizarre compared with the grab drag philosophy of powerpoint but the fact is that everyone is used to it learn photoshop learn the quirks then it makes sense even if gimp were more sensible arrangement of the tools photoshop person knows the steps to create particular effect and they just aren there in gimp it just close enough to be frustrating and hence wine photoshop
shit floats to the top thinking about the kinds of people that start wars for oil profits by the way it was the right thing to do when the inventor ate his own dogfood brave too oh and really urge everyone to buy only this kind of tablesaw from now on the guy from the story started his own company and the company knows of at least five other amputations that have been averted it also great way to stick it to the man

wonder does reddit incorporate the number of comments in determining how high website is ranked maybe it should it something always scan for when selecting articles to read lots of comments means it controversial or at least an article worth discussing
it is not clear that it is even done all that cheaply you have to replace the stopping mechanism after each use as read the website and am guessing you may need to replace the blade however ll stick with my conspiracy theory as soon as saw the video guessed it could be done using the same technology for touch lamp and any engineer can imagine ways to stop spinning blade fast first you have to want to do it

religion is created to explain the unexplainable therefore it must be accepted on faith by definition since it for something unexplainable the natural result of this is that when different religions have different explanations for the same thing the respective sides go to war against each other few people have the ability to genuinely doubt their own belief system
thanks jesusphreak from an atheist it nice to hear that interpretation coming from christian since it seems that way to me too are the stories in the old testament considered basis for understanding christianity or is it the stories in the new testament that christians use to guide them on this issue ask because having read some of the old testament there are passages where god at various times encourages murder sacrifice and supports war this seems to change in the new testament with the teachings of christ
to me who never read this article and expect others as well this is new happy for them to be posted and if they climb in the rankings other people are too mod the story down if you find it old easy
code compiled with the chez compiler is very fast the chez compiler is somewhat expensive there is freely available interpreter though which is actually very fast for numerical computations in scheme it seems gambit is popular for amazingly fast code use stalin but be prepared for long compile times
thanks someone who actually answers question for change
though know mzscheme has compiler and probably others so it would have been interesting to see how his version compared to the automatically generated one
don know tcl so please elaborate

bmw de behaviour was bad but the unbiased data is that now people searching for bmw germany are no longer getting the right result in this particular case is not clear if google is helping users to find the right site think search egines should have algorithms that are able to compute how search results are returned without human attendance of the form hey this site is using bad stuff remove it from the index in prefect world the algorithm for search results should be at the same time public and impossible to cheat like belived secure crypto algorithms if this is not possible at least think it is good idea to write an algorithm and let it run without humans verdicts removing sites from the index by hand is for search engine like all that ugly conditional expressions used in spaghetti code to handle special stuff in the code flow

the people who get their site listed first purely by hacking the algorithm that puts it there with content that no human will ever see more so than the search engine that tries to be smart about what pages it lists as most relevant and relies on people not being sneaky bastards about it google can only do so much to prevent that so little motivation like this doesn hurt they ll probably be back soon anyway as to the indexing that how that works bots don execute javascript that only logical if you violate accessibility standards by not having the actual content in html it not going to get indexed if they know web design well enough to fool google they know web stuff well enough to realize that

dawkins seems to have spent lot of time thinking about this judging from all his publications about this what would you expect him to do to make him qualified in this matter should he study theology become priest or are all non religious people simply disqualified from arguing about religion which would mean only pro religious arguments are qualified

should have said his chosen culture perhaps he consistently refers to western culture as something we own he may have muslim name but it seems he identifies more as westerner which is perfectly fine don read the article the same way you do his agenda is that the west should not apologize for itself across very broad scope this is great when he means contemporary freedom of expression not so great when we re talking about british rule in india
yes think that correct the open source definition states that an open source license gt shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources the license shall not require royalty or other fee for such sale and gt must not discriminate against any person or group of persons but it does not mean that it will be distributed to everyone it could be that he plans to give it to certain organizations who wouldn then distribute the software to other parties though if they wanted to redistribute the software don think he would be able to stop them it is odd that the second paragraph states that his program would be freely available that makes me think that he would be offering it to other people along with those organizations
and he right jewish tradition explicitly says teach these things to your children psalm if recall off the top of my head professor dawkins just figured out something that was in the bible all the time he puts different angle on it of course as christian find perhaps surprising appreciation in dawkins articles lot of what many christians do is hypocritic unloving uncaring making up religious cruft and totally against the bible christians claim that the most important thing to do is to love god with all of your heart and love your neighbor as yourself my goodness if we all actually did that professor dawkins would have much harder time refuting the existence of god

there no conflict between condoning some behaviour and condemning other behaviour so far that the point ve understood you ve been trying to make assume that you condone some things and condemn certain other things can safely assume this because there really is no other way of being you imply that if support homosexual love therefore unless am to be found out as hypocrite must support all kinds of love we all place marker between what is acceptable and not acceptable my definition of acceptable when it comes to love is for the people to be of the age of consent and for the relationship to not be damaging or otherwise abusive so support homosexual love between consensual adults as do heterosexual love between consensual adults this is the prevailing thought in enlightened societies what you disparagingly describe as fashion is in fact great respect for the dignity of other people and an understanding that consensual adult love is not something to be feared demonised or ridiculed not motivated to support homosexual love because wish to be seen as tolerant by other people motivated because have respect and consideration for the people live alongside

more on ants according to net gt the algorithm does not scale well at all if the application wants to speak with particular peer it ends up doing broadcast search or random walk though if they are lucky enough for that to succeed the antnet routing should optimize that found connection this means that while these networks can work great at small scales they are not suitable for large networks where someone wants to get in touch with another specific peer that does not mean that there is no value in these systems just that their applicability is limited to situations where their particular issues can be addressed

pope john paul in his speech to the pontifical academy of science in stated that the bible itself speaks to us of the origin of the universe and its makeup not in order to provide us with scientific treatise but in order to state the correct relationships of man with god and with the universe sacred scripture wishes simply to declare that the world was created by god and in order to teach this truth it expresses itself in terms of cosmology in use at the time of the writer previous to that address the vatican ii council introduced many aspects of modern science in church life in the mid yet many christians ignore the vatican think mel gibson is one of them pope john paul ii addressing the pontifical academy of science in burrows and selkirk eds confronting creationism defending darwin kensington australia

this is the kind of faux responsible argument that atheists make when they want to sound reasonable and still make sure that their position wins lt rewrote the following for clarity gt there is no way to prove the existence of god there is also no way to disprove the existence of god if you don believe me google up alvin plantinga he philosophy prof at notre dame and read few of his papers shifting the burden of proof to the believer is thus way to make believers lose the argument which isn what this kind of discussion is supposed to be about in particular your proposition that it should be obvious that this is not rational position to take is not an argument it statement of your opinion that makes you no better than all the other crazed believers

well you are believer rationality will not sway you since god is by definition conventiently irrational fair enough am hard atheist the facts combined with the scientific method lead me to the conclusion that god does not exist gt for now either position is equally justifiable given the right set of priori assumptions no those positions are not equally justifiable first of all believers conveniently phrase the concept of god in such way that it is not open to enquiry as you yourself concede you might as well say that froobles are not snortly and it would make just as much sense note that it was not always this way just few hundred years of scientific progress have pushed the god concept into this dark corner as various claimed magical aspects of gods have been disproven by observation of the facts secondly would also like to point out that if by your account both positions are equally justifiable then you must believe that the existence of any deities from the olympians to xenu are just as justifiable as the existence of your particular deity that at least should give you some pause none of this arguing before or after this post will change your mind but am hopeful that in the future we will find way of at least containing these regressive thought patterns the best way of course is to stop these memes ah our friend dawkins from appearing in children in the first place because they are certainly hard to get rid of

well agree that it was dumb of them to allow that grammatical error in an article criticising bad grammar and poor writing skills but that error doesn trump the assertion that the state of business writing is abominable it the same quality of english in the hard sciences and especially law try reading large selection of legal briefs if you don believe me before we criticize the shorthand many corporate employees use to get some actual work done that bit disingenuous grammatical indifference or ignorance is actually an impediment to getting some actual work done the article demonstrated that shorthand or im type writing actually prevents more work from getting done because it causes confusion and shoddy communication as well as creating repeated messages email and meetings

the big bang is just theory shocked shocked tell you what waste of bandwidth the dictionary on my desk contains this definition of the word theory set of statements or principles devised to explain group of facts or phenomena especially one that has been repeatedly tested or is widely accepted and can be used to make predictions about natural phenomena so if nasa or anyone else adds the word theory to the big bang it actually an admission that bb is widely accepted explanation of the origins of the universe but admitting this theory is widely accepted does not make it provable or fact calling bb theory actually encourages science by allowing other theories to be explored instead of shutting down further inquiry on scientific fact

muslims have no right or reason to complain about any of this because it never happened yeah that right denying that offensive cartoons about mohammed were ever published there is no evidence of any of this just as there was never holocaust more appropriately called shoah btw as the recently elected iranian prime minister claims tolerance is two way street there must not be tolerance of utter intolerance fanatics of any type must be kept in check on more detailed level there is no such thing as muslims as proxy for radical islamists or sexually frustrated angry men just as not every american is creationist fundamentalist christian in tehran youths party underground because it illegal and they want to live similar life to what people in the freer world are living unfortunately iran and many other arab but also non arab countries have structural disconnect between what the majority of reasonable people including very importantly women want and what those who hold power decide is true and good for people it simply called totalitarianism oppression fascism dictatorship etc name it what you will pick whatever shade but that the core of the problem

islamofacist is perfectly applicable term as the islamist and the nazis are perfect bedfellows both have burning hatred of the jewish people both are fond of using bullying tactics to get their way both employ scapegoating the other to stir their followers into action nazism had mein kampf rambling logic impaired screed preaching hatred for non aryans and written by crazy man the islamists have the koran rambling logic impaired screed preaching hatred for non believers and written by man claiming to be god spokesman hitler and his followers routinely insisted that all they wanted was peace islamists routinely insist that islam is religion of peace so what really is the difference maybe instead of saying bush hitler we ought to be saying muhammed hitler

the question is whether you ignore anamolies in your data set and continue to search for empirical support for theory explaining away mis match between empirical data and predictive theory with new particles which have yet to be explained or do you re examine theory and see that there could be logical explanation for observed data that does not match the current theory in this case give the benefit of the doubt to the researchers working on dark matter as it is fairly young idea and deserves proper consideration however there are competing viewpoints so that tag line is essentially false it could read researchers who continue to believe in the theory of general relativity as posited by einstein all agree that dark matter must exist for the theory to be valid otherwise as the article states there wouldn be enough gravity to keep things from flying apart for an alternative view go here http www stanford edu afmayer happen to think that this modification is lot more logical than some of the dark matter explanations this theory is not proven by any means it is only theory and could well turn out to be wrong simply disagree with the willingness to overlook many of the well known anamolous phenomena in gravitational field theory

being norwegian have followed the development in this case avidly must say it gives me great relief to see moderate muslims putting up an apology like this will defend personal freedoms with my life and the arab people will have to swallow down its anger and accept our freedom of press yet conflicts have more than two sides and it is obvious that we have offended the muslim population gravely care little whether moderate muslims are in majority the fact that they dare speak up at all is enough for me remember that the arab population is completely foreign to the personal freedoms we have in the west norwegian student present during the burning of the danish embassy in syria said that the greatest difficulty he had regarding the cartoons was making people understand that they weren representative of the government policy go figure for myself take this apology to heart and am deeply grateful that some muslims are willing to attemt at peaceful coexistence

seems like karma should contribute to an initial score and perhaps karma should go below as well post for example by someone with negative karma would start out at some value below zero which would relieve the burden on readers to mod down
this should become one of wikipedia greatest hits
the biggest problem is that these spam posts come in floods and they push good articles off the new page quickly making it impossible for good articles to get enough votes to move from new to hot in that way they do lot of collateral damage
there were times when saying the counterexamples you name would have caused serious stirr to give them some time their sixties have yet to arrive but they will eventually guess
for example it should lead to an efficient way of deciding whether given large number is prime no existing algorithms designed to do this are guaranteed to terminate in finite number of steps this sentence is obviously incorrect hope the rest is not
combine that with the score threshold and it would be fairly easy to keep most people from seeing bad links
while humorous yes this is almost two years old
this would just result in the spammer creating new account which reddit make as easy as possible as part of their business model
there really no practical way to block this that can see to wit blocking users with large negative karma won help any they ll just make new accounts making the problem worse it may be possible to block site that is each site has karma and eventually trying to post link to this site is impossible gets negative initial score or is only possible by users who have large positive score even the site based blocking can be circumvented in number of ways is foo site com the same site and thus subject to the same penalties as bar site com how about site co uk and site co uk which leaves boosting articles posted by high karma people and or boosting articles pointing to high karma sites both have large potential for groupthink not good another option is system like but unsure of how to implement it you don just vote up or down but you state reason this also solves problems where you are stuck ie when good article is posted with crappy descrip title vote it up or down then again that ruins the elegance of the reddit system guess the current concept is just as good as any more convoluted system to try and avoid this from happening could live with the site karma thing though as long as it properly implemented hint it takes list of top level domains like co uk you can just start counting periods that security risk

agree that this one of the worst symptoms at least it seems solvable flood control for multiple submissions to single site as reddit gets more popular the queue size will only get larger although theoretically this is offset by more eyeballs on queue on the subject of the queue one annoyance is not having pager id be interested to know the reason behind this design decision how about pager at least for the queue one reason that these problems are so hard to solve is because its so easy to create an account think this is probably fundumental reddit tenet ie paul graham wrote about it so captchas might help the spam problem others have yearned for tagging sounding familiar big part of what like about reddit over digg com is that its not just tech news although im sure the reddit powers that be might be little concerned over the increasingly leftist leanings of the hot page the other two features on reddit prefer over digg is the negative digg and nested comments ok the community is whole lot more mature as well hmm originally started that last paragraph expecting to conclude digg had better system
the different between disapproving of bush vs islamic extremist if you say negative things about bush half the population agree with you the other half says it your freedom of opinion it is built into the system people are known to say may not agree with it but will fight for your right to say it disgree with any part of islam even the most extreme views you are blasphemer and shall be put to death the middle east is in state thought similar to the spanish inquisitions people don challenge anything in the religon or any interpretation of their moula if they revealed themselves they would be in severe danger

while agree with your point re price of liberty is eternal vigilance think your kinda missing the point at the moment it takes redditors to bury story to the default threshold lets say an abusive user like the ones mentioned in this post consistently get all their stories buried and all the stories point to the same site lets say this has happened times as is almost the the case for nyc at this point id be quite happy for for the system to nuke this guys account submissions anyone else how about vote btw digg has an ignore user feature which suppose is bit more democratic
think that is smart way putting the site onto black list to weed out spammers wonder whether there should be seperate button to mark spam explicitly rather than the voting system so you could different just bad article vs real spam
the following is from www arabnews com of saudi arabia what separates us from the christian and judaic followers is not our sense of piety and reverence but our sentimental threshold we are undeniably too sensitive and take offense easily we are fiercely protective of our beliefs and value systems but this is our prerogative what shameful right does christian newspaper hold in patronizing us over personal belief that neither defies basic human or moralistic values nor infringe on cross cultural sentiment http arabnews com page amp section amp article amp amp amp

my mistake apologies again would edit my earlier reply but reckon that would make an even bigger mess
its good article isnt it it got alot of good info hope every one enjoy this like me
and how should dress
amen this article beggars belief that and the number of folk who appear to agree with it mean forget about the frequent burnings of rock albums bombings of abortion clinics about the time the us declared war on mormons because they practiced bigamy the whole ira thing the nazi thing everyone knows christians and all non muslims never do anything like that edit to those who have downmodded this comment please reflect on the articles demonstrably false claim that non muslim religions do not indulge in violence the author should not be fired for his opinions he should be fired for his lack of integrity and knowledge of very recent history
agree with what you re saying on an intuitive level but don you feel little nervous arguing reject the following world view because it might plausibly arise from the following circuimstances there are other ways gt don see why deism would need special treatment an anthropomorphic god who created the universe causes or allows it to function consistently according to physical laws and for some reason wants adulation from the intelligent inhabitants thereof would create universe very much like ours

did great in algebra when took it would often finish the classwork and get started on my homework before some more confused souls could finish their classwork often would be asked to help those who never talked to otherwise much like karin would not of been talked to by johnny in the article
this article is much better than the previous one that appeared on digg the author appears to actually know what he talking about this time
think what the author was trying to convey is that even though full system restore wouldn be needed usuer losing all of his pictures documents music files etc would be almost as devastating as having to restore the entire system remember the users he talking about are the non tech savvy ones who just want to start their computer do their thing and not have to think about anything else you may not like what he has to say but he does have point
for typos or linkjacking why not let the commenters suggest new title or link and when the suggestion is modded past the original title it gets replaced that way everyone can mod the article based on the merits of the article and mod the title or link or whatever separately you don lose the reddit cleanliness and you get to say the title should be buy stuff from my site rather than just that title sucks for people like me who don care about the title link comments on most articles the whole thing is hidden people who care can participate as much as they care to
am the one who finds this paragraph quite loathsome with the big tool companies declining to participate sawstop is seeking other ways to make sure its technology is adopted in april the company filed petition with the consumer product safety commission to make sawstop like technology standard on all table saws six months later the power tool institute consortium of power tool makers filed an opposing brief in which it argued that sawstop is speculative and untested technology in addition the cost to consumers and manufacturers of granting the petition would far outweigh any benefits that may be realized the industry also claims to be developing its own safety systems the cpsc is expected to release its findings this summer if it states as gass hopes and expects that the technology is effective it will be the first step in long process of making sawstop or similar injury prevention system mandatory as cool as the technology is it is totally wrong to use gov to force other manufacturers to adopt it or something like it which they could then probably sue over if consumers want that safety they ll buy it unless it comes at too much of price premium in which case they don want to be forced to buy it that really lousy business if you ask me

imagine to yourself cartoon of martin luther king sodomizing little children are you seriously proposing an american newspaper would publish something so gratuitously offensive in the name of free speech of course not because that the line between freedom of expression and incitement to hatred and cartoon of mohammed with bomb in headdress goes way over that line

eh you seem to be very hung up on technical legal term felon that doesn directly relate to the performance of president say that have an employee and he turns out to be sex offender pretty shocked because sex offenders are awful right but what if it happened when my employee was his girlfriend and his girlfriend disapproving parents wouldn let them get married they had sex and he therefore committed statutory rape now he out of jail married to his girlfriend has kids that adore him and he proven himself trustworthy to me but he sex offender right and should be wary of employing him clearly bill was skeezy and clearly my hypothetical employee was slightly skeezy but it really has no relevance to the present and shouldn get hung up on the legal definition sometimes strict adherence to definitions only over simplifies the situation

this should have been headlined where did firefox come from

agree with this suggestion when you mod something down you re supposed to be doing it to train filter not to mark something as spam there difference between an article that bores you and one that you feel is an abuse of reddit and the ui probably should reflect that
the idea that originality is the problem is outrageous the island got about half of the possible stars or which ever rating system is used in general also the majority of the audience probably came from people who saw the original not year old males

replying the mnemonicsloth rewritten comment which brings up some new points gt there is no way to prove the existence of god there is also no way to disprove the existence of god if you don believe me oh do believe this absolutely in the modern sense of the word god where all that is left of god is concept that by definition can not be reasoned about of course in any sense that god did impinge on the world he has been disproven and thus the concept has devolved into meaningles statement gt if you don believe me google up alvin plantinga he philosophy prof at notre dame and read few of his papers he christian apologetic right says wikipedia am going to need better referral than that really http en wikipedia org wiki apologetics gt apologetics serves an intellectual function within religious communities by providing arguments that support the doctrinal and ethical tenets of the religion these arguments strengthen the believer faith and support the propagation of the religion by offering arguments intended to persuade the uncommitted gt skeptics engaged in debate with apologists tend to expect apologetics to consist of powerful arguments intended to persuade skeptics and are sometimes surprised by the failure of these arguments to even approach this goal occasionally it because the apologist just isn any good most often though it because the arguments only had the purpose of giving current believers license to continue believing since skeptics are not the intended target at all these arguments aim for much lower burden not trying to do more than make the religious belief plausible or cast doubt on skeptical arguments mnemonicsloth gt shifting the burden of proof to the believer is thus way to make believers lose the argument which isn what this kind of discussion is supposed to be about that is just silly placing the burden of proof on the the party making the claim is simple common sense one can make an infinite amount of claims about reality any such claim is essentially worthless unless backed up by facts or you will need to consider sofas circling saturn http reddit com info id ae of course we have already agreed that the existence of god is placed outside of rational argument by the all too convenient definition of god so the question is moot gt in particular your proposition that it should be obvious that this is not rational position to take is not an argument it statement of your opinion you are actually arguing that something is true unless disproven to quote myself the believer asserts that something is true unless disproven it should be obvious that this is not rational position to take that is quite an amazing position to take have you thought this through gt that makes you no better than all the other crazed believers take objection to that perhaps you have just misread what said though hope so
agree in general with your comment gt don think it is naive to argue that if bush did the crime he got to do the time that wasn my point don think it naive to suggest deserved punishment think it naive to say if bush did anything illegal that conditional without meaning either it is impossible for him to do anything illegal or he has already done illegal things plans to do further illegal things and has said so publicly gt if you have arbitrary enforcement you don have rule of law if that is the proper criterion then think you re saying we don have rule of law gt or perhaps break the law and be prepared to be punished if you get caught sure whatever don you agree however that it is immoral to imprison someone for giving marijuana to elderly person in order to ease pain in the unlikely event that wind up on your jury for such crime prepare to walk away
that was horrible why didn they have better rapping mean agh really its the legend of zelda and its really rad come on unless this was meant to be this bad in which case its funny that commercial would never make to the superbowl
agree that the situation is ridiculous and do not in any way condone theose who are protesting violently but they are not acting for no reason at all their reasons are poor and would say misguided but they do have them and we would do well to understand that these are not random irrational acts but that there are reasons even if they are poor ones think juan cole analysis here offers good deal of light on understanding the phenomenon http www juancole com muslim protests against anti muhammad html note also that many in the still do not think that sacrelige is acceptable there were actually fairly wide scale and angry protests here against piss christ last temptation of christ etc happily they were non violent but that was more due to the order of our society than the the protesters controlling themselves the same people who are currently trying to get flag burning illegalized would be steadily trying to get anti cristian sacreligious speech illegalied here if our constitution was not in place to guarantee the right

hindus may consider it odious to use cows as food but they do not resort to boycotts threats and violence when non hindus eat hamburger or steak they do not demand that everyone abide by the strictures of hinduism and avoid words and deeds that hindus might find upsetting guess the author has no passing familiarity with occasional hindu muslim clashes and rioting in india that has been going on for many years many of the individual conflicts originated when hindu would release pigs in muslim neighborhood or muslim would throw dead cow in hindu temple you can google hindu muslim riot to find articles on various riots

although reddit won allow negative karma maybe the system could calculate persons actual negative karma and then silently throw away submissions from really low karma people so it takes them while to figure out they were banned otherwise they would just make new account
from the numbers in this article it seems to me that if you had tax on bottled water it would solve all the world water problems
no one rapes children in the name of mlk granted but there are groups of folk who blow up abortion clinics and burn books amp demon music in the name of jesus years ago it was common to defend slavery by quoting the bible the good book has been used to justify all manner of atrocities many of them recent don be too sure of your moral superiority here you should also look into the radical reactionary shift in dutch politics in the last ten years this is not bolt from the blue
almost voted for the spam button but going to have to go for worse is better here think it should be harder to get negative karma than it is to lose karma and think that it should be hidden from public view for the reasons jedberg mentioned some sort of rate limiting to discourage submitting bunch of links from the same site all at once might be good too

not all articles modded down are spam sometimes they are innocent reposts sometimes they are articles that perhaps only two people disagreed with modded down and thus go into negative land reddit points can mean variety of things negative points do not necessarily mean bad article and lots of positive points do not necessarily mean good article on side note it might be fun to in addition to top page have bottom page with the all time lowest articles what might we find we might not want to know
see what you did there
it stinks
spam is certainly different to reddit and to the people who post it but not sure it so different to the reader there lot of stuff don want to see on reddit celebrity gossip linkjacking astroturfing porn press releases spam all that really matters to me is that don want to see it and down arrow provides me with that option
widget that allows you to select specific page like on google next or like edit the second option would give worst stories feature as well like another poster mentioned
some things to think about while this article debates the usefulness of bottled water its highly controversial whether tap water is really that good for you too plain fact of life is that most water is flushed goes down the drain in the shower is used in washing machines amp dish washers and whatever else and its simply too expensive to get the water whistle clean like ppm solid particulates municipalities should be constantly monitoring their water for contaminants but many upper safe limits set by the fda epa epa in this case are controversial and there isn total agreement on what should be monitored in the first place some may monitor mtbe and perchlorate while others do not note that there are literally thousands of chemicals in water some natural some man made and testing for all of them is tough water from the colorado river seems to have high levels of perchlorate municipal water quality may change by season in phoenix when the monsoons come supposedly the solid particulates are elevated your best bet for clean safe water is to either find filter for your home which is reverse osmosis and steam distilled but beware because there are lots of peddlers in this domain or find water store that you can trust see below if using home water filter use potassium rather than sodium ion exchanger if you decide to go the water store route realize that they don all use the same equipment some may be more deligent than others about when to replace their filter and some may be able to give you independent report which shows their filter effectiveness see below on water storage the person working at the store or the owner should at least be able to tell you what the typical amount of solid particlates in ppm is it should be between and locate lab in your area that can analyze the water for particulate matter and other disolved compounds if your tap water water store home filtered water lives up to your expectations great for storing water glass works best but there are some obvious disadvantages it is the most stable and there will be no chance of solvents leaching into your water for portability re use bottle like nalgene bottle to minimize environmental waste whatever brand you decide on your best bet looks like polycarbonate despite the fears of bisphenol polycarb is hard clear plastic get something without dyes avoid the plastic bottles that look cloudy often used for and gallon bottled water avoid plastic bottled made out of pet pet polyethylene tetraphthalate if you use plastic bottle don expose it to much uv sunlight as it is unknown whether the bottle you hold in your hand has uv stabilizers to be extra safe avoid exposing your polycarb bottles to exreme heat like the dishwasher even though study showed that this is generally not problem other plastics may fare more poorly some popular glass bottle sizes might be able to fit into insulation sleve often fitted for nalgene bottles you can get these at an rei or other outdoor sports store distilled water is ok for you but make sure you get total in your diet the right amount of magnesium and calcium studies have shown that there is corelation between cardiovascular disease and localities which have water low in minerals but you can make up for this yourself by taking good calcium calcium citrate or magnesium magnesium citrate supplement which are often cheap try solgar now solaray or nature way recommended ratio ca mg used to be but now is like folks with kidney problems may have to pay even more attention to water quality

how about lynching the first black man you see after white woman is raped muslims do not have monopoly on depraved mob violence
there are definately different reasons for not liking an article an example to illustrate this although not as important as abuse would be duplicates resist marking down duplicates especially if the topic is of interest to me because dont want to train out that particular submitter whatever he she may have submitted at nearly the same time or just not seen the previous story etc but do want to bury the story nonetheless for various reasons ie not fragmenting the vote rewarding the original submitter mark as spam duplicate brings us back to the digg model of having listbox as mentioned in another post in this thread digg have an ignore user that hides all stories comments for that user this would be much more helpful to me that the current hide story button
test
excellent article now come and get mee too
so trying to get read on the reddit audience demographic here what ve got so far unemployed liberal atheist lisp programmers am missing anything
the title to this is misnomer
don agree with your examples because muslims have right to be offended about religious things but do agree with the no reason whatsoever because of the following http www zombietime com images of mohammed have been published in children books for decades and were even drawn by ancient muslims picking the danish newspaper out of all these examples and rioting about that is totally random
read the article yesterday in print reactions south park episode isn much to build on is it possible that the uproar which struck me as utterly fake involved janet jackson because she has given occasional indications of being real person where justin timberlake seems to have been die stamped in boy band factory on the other hand yes you need to tell your sons to be responsible good for her confiscating the hat teaching human sexuality education she sending those th graders out to teach human sexuality wow

there still no better judge of content than human so there no better solution than that however adjusting posting priviliges by people who articles have taken nosedive in the past sounds like good idea
the original statement was in the uk most people get on just fine without believing in god that incorrect in the uk at least equal numbers believe in god as those who don
these folks don need to be apologizing to danes but rather need to be taking their respective cultures and communities back from the nut cases who they ve put in charge iran and palestine are two prime examples of entities that are at the cusp of their greatest opportunities in the last years to be leading independent successful demonstrations of the potential that their respective societies have to offer in both cases they have opted through relatively democratic processes not available throughout the rest of the islamic world to reject peace reason and co existence with the rest of humanity and are in the process of reversing all the progress and efforts made heretofore spitefully tossing to the wind all the sacrifices made by their own people and those who put their trust and hope that they could successfully self govern the rest of the world is dismayed and shocked at these events but will not also let these decisions take the rest of us with them we hate to see you screw yourselves up but you sure as heck better contain your troubles within your own borders after you ve proved wrong everone who believed in you who will have the heart and will to support you ever again time short to fix this until clear majority speaks and acts against this insanity within these cultures they have lost all credibility for those who truly want peace guess who that leaves to deal with them
none that the point am the product of half dozen peoples who raped amp pillaged each other for thousands of years isn it time we stopped demonizing people based on stereotypes is one of the reasons we re in this mess not only is it hypocritical it encourages you to think of them as less civilized ie less human than us from there it short step to justifying violence against them
no the burden of proof is on the op for making the bold statement that god doesn exist looking at the replies not one of them even attempts to prove god doesn exist they just shift the burden to the believer
not necessarily just start karma on instead of can mod up your own posts put all posts in an area for mavens let users set their own browsing threshold detect spam account detection one account always modding up another account posts within hours for example should be pretty easy to fix this they need good rec filter anyway slashdot for all of its problems has reasonable solution to this modding filtering rarely see the spam there
would think things would change for the better thomas friedman describe it as the curse of oil he wrote in his book the world is flat highly recommend it when nation leaders can practice petrolism they never have to tap their people energy and creativity they simply have to tap an oil well and therefore politics in petrolist state is not about building society or an educational system that maximizes its people ability to innovate export and compete it is simply about who controls the oil tap in petrolist states like russia iran venezuela and sudan people get rich by being in government and sucking the treasury dry so they never want to cede power in non petrolist states like taiwan singapore and korea people get rich by staying outside government and building real businesses it isn the entire story because lot of other factors play large roles in the wealth of nation lt edit oops forgot the link to the article gt http timworstall typepad com timworstall thomas_friedman html
now you re shifting the burden of proof onto me the burden of proof is on the one who made the assertion since mikaelhg said god doesn exist he has to prove why he doesn exist when anyone is making bold claim it is not someone else responsibility to disprove the claim but is rather the person responsibility who is making the bold claim to prove it http en wikipedia org wiki burden_of_proof

lets call radical islam what it is facism its ugly don be surprised if we have to fight fascism again it wasn nice the last time around left my great grandfather blind and grandfather with lifetime malarial complications but it was worth it they told me
you complain about muslims yet respond like this appalled by the recent actions of so called protesters mindless thugs in places like afghanistan and palestine but surely one of their greatest faults is the readiness with which they make sweeping generalisations about entire nations of people as if they were single entities how are your stereotypes any different your suggestion that people can only be made to learn through killing and maiming sounds remarkably familiar does descending to their level not just defeat the whole point of defending the freedom to print the cartoons in the first place seriously you should read more about the context http english ohmynews com articleview article_view asp menu amp no amp rel_no amp back_url before deciding who deserves to learn their lesson after all how many scandinavians do you actually know
cut the crap which mess that some cartoons fire up some hooligans to start destroying things and have reason to do so person based on any type of faith or belief that lynchs raped woman is less civilized than someone that helps the same woman if you want to live on the guilty of your antecessors go ahead and set yourself on fire as gift to the gods
can confirm this live in flagstaff az and whenever go down to phoenix drink bottled water however have had water at restaurants while there and usually it tastes just fine perhaps most restaurants use purified water
the mess being the very real danger of another war between western countries and the middle east of which this little incident is just part and the abysmal lack of understanding displayed by the op ed and the comments on this page instead of arguing points you resort to slang and insults if two random people who speak the same language cannot really communicate about this issue say that serious mess
no kidding the gallon figure almost nobody pays unless you count containers liter or smaller from convenience store to do fair comparision between that and gas think you would have to compare it to small container of propane for barbecuing when purchased from convenience store

finally something that works perfect egg boiling time from formula

fully agree dont think this is big problem the new threshold system has made massive difference many average joe users wont even see this problem because they only use the hot and maybe the recommended page this is really only an issue for redditors who tend the queue and its only minor annoyance the point of the submission and its one that agree with is that for abuse it might possible to do something about it obvious as in user submissions to one site all modded down think adding spam button is probably overkill its just more interface clutter on that point get rid of the hide button too
that was rad
the only efficient algorithms for primality known in were randomized ie not guaranteed to terminate in finite number of steps it has since been proven that deterministic polynomial algorithms for primality do in fact exist considering that this is popular science article think bending the truth tiny bit is completely defendable it allows her to avoid explaining what the words randomized deterministic and polynomial mean and how in fact there is an algorithm guaranteed to terminate in finite number of steps just not an efficient one
was just saying that anyone who wanted to spam wouldnt use an account that had negative karma when they can easily create an account that has the same karma as any other new user interesting you mention slashdot slashdot encourages you to browse at minus one the lowest level when you have mod points the equivalent of this is tending the reddit queue with filtering disabled
quite clearly understand that most of the middle east is now rioting because somebody in denmark used freedom that we consider to be the most sacred right we have as people in his own country and they don like it well tough he didn do anything to any of their countries and their laws don apply in his if there has to be war then don know of any ideals that would rather fight for than freedom of speech
are you joking or are you actually rejoicing in depravity and violence you seem to realize the horrific consequences of making the world afraid of you yet you don care friend that is the true reason many people are gunning for the us the real crazy fuckers are not in the streets of beruit
they are not more likely to react violently they have reacted violently when read their cartoons mocking and insulting my people it makes my blood boil but support their right to create and publish them and certainly not going to go set the nearest mosque on fire
who cares what the cause is its not acceptable today
you hit the nail on the head friend imagine two groups of people who don want to fight anymore how would you get them to fight why find an incident that transgresses on their respective sacred beliefs preferably ones which are not clearly understood by the other westerners being secular folk do not get why cartoon of the prophet is so bad those arabs who live in openly repressive places do not understand the grail of free speech there are people of all faiths and all countries who do not want more war this baiting and jingoism drowns out their efforts as it is intended to do it is not coincidence that this occurred now the imminent opening of the iranian euro market for oil the referral of iran to the un the scandals in the iraqi oil ministry and is being played up by those on both sides who want more war it simple power play consolidate your power by making your people angry and afraid shout loudly to cover the noises of war preparation the cartoons are convenient excuse the tactic works en masse the counter to it critical thinking and self education only comes one person at time
exactly what seems to be the case is that little bit of information triggered huge reaction in lot of islamic societies the same type of information did not trigger as huge response in the western countries their society is very allergic to certain kinds of information when your society can process information correctly then that bug in the system in my opinion but don forget the other side of it the west has had it hand in creating the bug by doing things most average citizens haven read about in the papers yes the radicals are wrong in hurting other people physically in response to just information but keep in mind that there reason they re this fucked up they live in totalitarian regimes and they ve been attacked from lot of sides their religion has something to do with it but also think other factors have made them into radicals
have very nice and well maintained bridge would like to sell you come on know there is some radiation but and enough to boil an egg that would not be suspect of long term cancer or give you slight warm feeling on your ear after minutes talking that would literally fry your brain
glancing at the headline thought it said my brain would deteriorate after age sob but the article actually implies brain maturity comes after yay yes significantly older than
but that doesn make any sense they can make caricatures of jesus moses buddah jews etc they can laugh and celebrate as thousands of civilians in our countries die hell they can even make their own drawings of mohammed like at http www zombietime com but yet when we do they yell off with their heads and set things on fire say that there is as something wrong with their culture now as there was something wrong with the german culture in and it may very well have the same result that doesn mean that they are inherantly evil or that islam is inherantly evil and violent no more than germans are fanaticism has taken over them and we have to fight it before it kills us
so this is what it like to be danish doesn feel all that different

exactly if your nod has to transfer all files being transferred by significant portion of you your neighbours for this to work it either going to lead to slowness on the scale of those anonimizer networks which this essentially just is lead to concession of its effect or more likely be dismissed as theorhetic tidbit also the riaa local net tap seems utterly unfeasible
it is featured article
on saturday appeared on cnn which was so terrified of reprisal that it pixelated the very cartoons that its viewers needed to see pathetic
actually that should be generalized there are many reasons for voting up or down but trying to cover them all ruins the elegance of reddit but as you are also training that filter it of some importance to be able to separate filter training from recommending the simplest way of doing this would be to have up and down arrows and obviously it would have to be an optional feature that you enable in your profile some reasons for mismatch between the recommend and the prefer arrows bunch of reasons why you may have mismatch between recommend and prefer guy kawasaki items follow his blog so don want them on my reddit however certainly would recommend his stuff to other reddit readers dupes want to anti recommend them but don want to train my filter against them want to leave that neutral spammed all over the earth type things you know everyone and the kitchen sink already knows about this so you don think it needs to go up on reddit but the content of the article is of such value that you certainly don want to train against it horrible reddit post the title is in all caps just bad wrong blogspamming etc so you want to recommend against it but you don want to train your filter against it interest mismatch it doesn interest you so you want to train against it but you think it particularly well written and hence would recommend it to other readers
exactly japan is not part of europe but they happily joined up with hitler and mussolini to form the axis powers
you don geddit aristus theory is that there are forces that want war as if there some kind of benefit or profit in it ofcourse there isn if you add everything up but there is profit for small group it seems that we can rile their side up with some pictures and you basically say that could never happen with us being led into fight with pictures so what would set the west off on fight maybe something like fanaticism has taken over them and we have to fight it before it kills us so what you are basically saying is we could never be nudged into violence war like them with pictures they re crazy so we must fight them war before they they kill us logic has left your brain really agree that the reaction of the extremists is incredibly bad but what haven read in the newspapers is what percentage of the people have rioted and what percentage has stayed home and shrugged their shoulders don think war is an efficient way to lessen their threat it ll make things worse maybe it just small group that conciously radical there must also be lot of feel good in this radical group thing sheep but most thinking muslims are probably sitting at home watching the weirdness unfold like we are
yes try filter our mediocre water tasted great after getting filter and it works out heaps cheaper than buying bottled water
interesting story but it fails to address some of the larger issues that are probably driving this behavior why do studios feel the need to have such outrageously large ticket sales virtually assured before they will even consider greenlighting movie perhaps the reason is because the system itself has become so top heavy and obese that it needs audiences in the tens of millions for every movie in order to sustain itself movie stars directors and special effects houses that demand millions or tens of millions of dollars per production push towards overly polished and refined end products and the countless mid level parasites that take their cut at every stage of the process have combined to turn hollywood into something far exceeding the parodies that it has always inspired the actual work that all of this machinery is supposed to support making movies has become just one minor cog in an immensely complex rube goldberg contraption little wonder then that the industry has found itself more and more addicted to sure hits like remakes and sequels and it likely to get lot worse before it gets better if it ever does

yeah thre always tradeoff between security and privacy it mostl just logical still one of my questions is how sure they were about the beforehand whether this was in part just question of laziness with an excuse you generally don tap phones to find bad guys you tap phones to verify suspected bad guys are just that find one out of dozens score out of of hundreds suppose but if they are hypothetically wrong about out of you have to wonder about their methods of finding anyone efficiently or figure this was in part fishing expedition but sort of doubt that sort of understand an information theory like approach to things like this bigger nets mean more probability and some less tactfully puttable things the about that thing is that if implicit or explicit spying rights are granted merely because it simpler than doing intelligent intelligence you have something to discuss
now now you re taking this too far we all know it feels great to imagine that democracy nay civilization itself is under siege from billion muslims eagerly foaming at the mouth to murder us all while we redditors the sole defenders of liberty valiantly rate up articles in the heroic struggle against islamofascism but it is universal truth that in almost any situation the majority of people simply wish to be left alone to raise their families you ll rarely hear from them precisely because of that they don want to risk getting involved
that is an interesting page the drawings of the prophet done by muslims you cite are hundreds of years old can think of few early christian rites that would not be advisable to try out on your local minister such as the kiss of brotherhood no culture is monolithic or static this is very important to keep in mind it easy to imagine that the muslim in the street is being manipulated into anger for instance by the three very inflammatory images faked up by the dutch imams but are you sure you are not being manipulated too already you are equating muslim countries with national socialist germany
the western papers printed these sacrilegious cartoons on the pretext of freedom of expression so let see if they mean what they say and also print these holocaust cartoons he said

way to name it ad gif gee that doesnt set off my ad blocking oh wait it does had to view in ie
that nasty dismissive opinion there guess you prefer unintelligent viewing like the majority of the populace it an important point though no amount of ranting railing and truth will do any good in democracy unless it gets publicized and understood and that where bush always wins
however at the same time there is need to realize that freedom of expression is responsibility that should not be used to gratuitously insult people beliefs well guess that means no more south park

was one of the people who hadn heard of the island until the release day after our last final of first year engineering bunch of us went to the theatre and saw it and you know what really enjoyed it http uwmike com articles the island it campy and over the top and maybe was just on post exam high but it was really fun movie the marketing campaign failed with me had no idea what to expect on the other hand also didn carry the baggage of rt score with me into the cinema was open minded not thinking needed to hate it to consider myself connoisseur an rt score may point to oscar material but it not the be all and end all of movie suckage
interesting just saw this article ont he front page of digg com http digg com apple
indeed muslims with keen eye for history and an open mind must be horrified for years it was muslims leading the way in medicine and many other fields while europe was stuck in the dark ages what happened

spammers will sabotage it by marking legitimate articles as spam perhaps if you weight it based on the percentage of the submitter own articles marked as spam
not equating them with the nazis for one they re not that well organized and they re certainly not nearly that bad yet it just an example of country with problem they obviously have problem violent outbursts for one thing and it needs to be solved before it starts really creating casualties sure that most of the people there want the violence to stop as much as we do again just as in nazi germany the majority weren really nazi hopefully this can be done without war but seriously you know that ferry that sank in egypt crowd of protestors set fire to that company headquarters today people see violence being performed and that the perpetrators aren punished so they take out their grief on setting other things on fire
saying it bad because it rushed while true in some cases is pretty simplistic explanation first there lot of reporting that comes out that isn late breaking news many of those contain false statements or other bad reporting for example the wine story false conclusion second there are many instances where reporters intentionally lie or practive self deception don think that being rushed is good excuse for bad reporting
here are the things that think would rile the west off on fight having our embassies torched having our citizens abroad kidnapped tortured and beheaded demands by people from another country that we curb the freedom of speech in our country however even that really isn enough and we re certainly not going to go to war over this but certainly think that we need to cut off all our aid mean what sense is it to send money to people who proclaim loudly every day that they want to kill us but think that there is only so much hate that they can throw our way before we finally get pissed off
so it was lunatic pamphlet not an actual published newspaper that was generally on sale

the scientists in the us know there is no competition between countries in science but with the us fucked up attitude about doing something for the common good labelling it immediately as communism and seeing this as reason not to do it for itself they don have much choice but to argue that funding science will help the us to stay on top
wow that got to be the most blatant press hit ve read in long time
you said but think that there is only so much hate that they can throw our way before we finally get pissed off it could be the reverse actually there have been bombings by the west on islamic countries maybe what we re seeing is combination of them finally getting pissed off at us extremists whipping them up into war fever who are those extremists exactly who are the core group of radicals and how big is this group as percentage of the population would be shame if small group was responsible for the us to finally get pissed off war while the majority did nothing just don know certain things aren said do know one thing though the extremists whatever their group size is are wrong
well if that your only criteria the us went through harrowing civil violence all throughout the th century from the wobblies to the kkk to race riots in la not to mention being involved with invasions or coups in nearly every country in their hemisphere some of them two or three times the only exceptions believe are bolivia amp canada am not condoning the violence am anti war and most especially anti propoganda that why am taking pains to point out how easily similar things could be spun by someone with an agenda if were to look at the us circa think the whole place had gone insane riots in the streets reactionaries with nuclear weapons etc etc etc the thing that is wrong with muslim states is how the people are being stirred up by their religious and political leaders and the media just like everywhere ffs advocating peace and people are modding me negative strange world eh
guns don kill people people kill people with guns
this article comes at particularly good time for me since in my second year of grad school and am starting to think this might not be the right thing for me went straight from college to grad school against others advice because at the time that applied felt was ready by the time started to realize might have been wrong about that already been accepted at ucla and thought it would be foolish to decline so didn take any time off and am now burned out and unmotivated also afraid to quit since don actually know why don like grad school or what rather be doing instead here funny thing in accordance with what paul said do actually produce on regular basis write blog work on my webpage cook bake draw and foster meaningful relationships with other people the problem is that don see what produce leading to any sort of career don blog about anything that would fascinate general audience don want to make webpages for anyone but myself have tendinitis in my wrists so can pursue cooking or probably drawing as profession and so incorrigibly sincere that can make living out of any of the well paying jobs that require fostering relationships with lots of people so while know what love in that sense don know how to translate what love into job that love still quite young so have plenty of time to figure things out but of course in the meantime left wondering what to do should stay with the safe path already on or blaze new trail for myself sigh wish the people who had told me grad school was really hard would also have mentioned that there was so much uncertainty involved http www lisabug net
really would like to know what the percentage is but doubt its that small hamas did get elected in palestine for example but hey if that minority siezes power well then we re screwed anyway even if they are the minority
sure you re right about what they would do but see two good ways to deal with it without spam button add captchas to the account creation process not my preferred solution but easy write algorithms to detect that sort of behavior suspect there already something pretty close in use by the recommendation engine low karma accounts that routinely promote articles that are routinely demoted by high karma accounts are detected as spammers elegant from the user perspective but harder to write my preferred solution
the usual distribution is good folk right bastards and who could go either way
believe me would love nothing more than peace wish everyone would sit down shut up and go take care of themselves and their family the problem with being peacable comes when the other guy isn hell yeah the us is not the model of perfection not saying that it shouldn have meddled in other countries and the people there have every right to fight back however the currect crisis is about the muslim states telling us what we can do in our own countries and they re doing it with violence against innocent people very much against that
whichever works better
limit the number of submissions per minute for an user that solves the problem mostly also check the http referrer edit it need not be minute time can be function of user frequency of submissions
am not sure it is banning them so much as requiring the user to clear them with the models involved the reason for this would likely have to do with the model future career if used the images in such way that the model lost future work well it is only fair to check with the model no don like that there are touchy subjects out there but personally would not like to have my photos used in piece of anti abortion literature others might fear for future jobs if their image appeared in religious context
truly wish for the same now let start convincing the other billion the crises are not separate unfortunately amp everyone has different map of grievances what we are seeing now is partly backlash from years of us british meddling in the middle east that is huge well of anger for the imams to tap

my freshman year of college lived with staunch objectivist he was an active member of the objectivist club think he was the president he was little odd an example one day said that our room was warm and wanted to keep the window open overnight he said he wanted it closed suggested compromise at which point he retorted compromised is for the weak and is not in my self interest then proceded to jam the window open so it could never be closed again at which point he said that he respected me for acting in my own self interest at least he was consistant
there is large population of muslims in holland concentrated mostly in rotterdam and amsterdam there has been lots of violence back and forth in the last ten years after the murder of theo van gogh several muslim schools where torched in rotterdam this is not case of peace loving chocolate eating danes publishing funny drawing the story is just as involved and bloody as race relations anywhere anywhen there no discernible reason for the muslims to act this way except that they are easily excited and violent this is exactly the vicious message the original op ed is trying to put across that muslims are just inexplicably violent for no reason the cartoons came alongside news that the danish army was deploying troops to the middle east whoops there have been several recent race riots in the states usually after policeman beats or kills somebody the last was in cincinatti ohio few years ago nb denmark amp holland are different countries yes am dirty american ve only been to holland so used them as an example denmark has about muslims itself

this is the kind of incident which might lead to another world war am sorry but the muslim religion has shown itself time and time again to be one of the most sensitive intolerant and oppressive religions known to man if they are so much better than the infidel they will simply brush off these cartoons as unworthy of notice just like the infidels who generated them but it seems they just can pass up on an opportunity to have little riot here and there have you ever noticed the amount of small children present at these riots do you think they actually know what is going on come on many of them are pre teen kids they are just being schooled from an early age in the art of the angry protest which will become their way of life infidel and bloody proud of it
have both spam and duplicate buttons and how about an edit button that will allow trusted users to fix typos in link titles but don put all these links at the top level instead either put them on the comment page or have an admin link that only appears when user reaches certain level of karma

woh nelly not quite sure about that part of it is bad news good news on the part of the media its kind of self fulfilling indonesia who has the largest population of muslims in any one nation has been perfectly peaceful which is amazing they are always at war with some remote province most days protests have been entirely protests not demonstrations they don want war

it interesting nyc tap water has probably contained these little critters for some time as long as you don know about them it not tragic that you eat them but once you know they re there you have to filter them out the first thing this makes me think of is ignorance of the law is not defense except this situation is different it not ignorance of the law but not being aware that the law is being broken and it seems like it only conscious willful breaches of the law that matter in this case

although there was little new information in this article found it to be pretty good summary
not random certain imams used the cartoons as lever to get support for boycott of danish goods and it basically exploded out of control there is lot of latent anger in the muslim world whose source is not that hard to figure out

conscience breaches of the law is exactly the problem here now that they know there are forbidden animals in the water the have to do something about it
it pretty easy to detect shill bidding ring if you will with some simple graphs of connectedness among accounts there is no need to filter based on the content of the websites
the problem with allowing only certian level of karma to perform certain actions is that you are biasing the site towards existing users which may not be so wise given that people already complain about how those with higher karma seem to have more power even though the rest of us know this isn true also without other backend spam detection in place it would be pretty easy to set up bunch of accounts to vote each other up and boost each other karma

the middle east already prints lt href http www adl org anti_semitism arab asp gt plenty lt gt of anti semitic cartoons the one linked scratches the surface yet don notice any of their embassies being torched including in israel israel maintains relations with jordan and egypt and has long maintained relations with turkey despite the fact that anti semitic caricatures can be found in their newspapers including state sponsored ones on regular basis denying the holocaust is also not illegal in many european countries denmark as well as the united states while it likely that those where it is legal likely have and enforce laws against defamation of muslims as well israel on the other hand had also prosecuted woman for drawing cartoon mocking muhammad and posting it on the front of an arab store in short this is more pathetic demagoguery coming from iran and it president who no doubt is doing this to create highly negative reaction from the united states and europe in order to use that fact to trump up nationalism in support of himself when clearly the youth of iran does not connect very much to his political views

allegro also had an advertisement complete with code examples in the most recent issue of dr dobbs however allegro isn good competitor to the java platform at the moment and speak not for myself personally since the java platform is almost entirely free open source software including the eclipse ide allegro however is almost prohibitively priced now myself will take emacs slime and cliki any day over java and it platform for the most part despise java and what it stands for but that combo isn enough to convince the industry to join in on lisp revival yet still it is pleasant to see lisp again becoming buzzword amongst the suits

maybe instead of separate recommend prefer system reddit should just start using the hide button in that manner so for you and me when you see guy kawasaki article after you plus you also hit hide and reddit can learn that you like the content in general but don want to see the article in particular for some other reason that already subscribed and read it and trains itself to find you similar articles but maybe not on that domain or whatever otoh vote down plus hide would be equivalent to spam rating
no never heard of mg or tp to be honest read very little find it hard to think clearly when read other people work really very easily influenced not joking even have theory that mass publication might not be morally correct but that another story and have little free time that explains why only skimmed the posted article was actually happily surprised to hear that we might agree doesn happen often

gt they are some of the least racist most open to non whites most generous and universally compassionate people gt they donate huge amount of money every year to non white poor people even if we were to accept your stereotype as being correct is that kind of behaviour really such bad thing to aspire to you seem to be suggesting that anyone who views the world with an open mind and rejects racism is somehow naïve gt so quite happy all this is going on just hope the muslims do something much worse soon enough so that the lesson really sinks in find your lack humanity incredible so we should all hope for death and the loss of innocent life would you willing to accept the murder of your friends and family so that the lesson really sinks in as said above your criticism of tolerance and desire for bloodshed seems to suggest that you have more in common with your enemies than you seem to realise
wow when exposure to conservatives and their views becomes the talking heads on news come entertainment right wing blogs that don care what the facts are gop politicians and ideologues president who scores votes with simple guy next door routine and an army of flag wavers posting drivel on the internet it becomes hard to afford right wing views any sort of credibility above emotive appeal to hear bush supporting conservative who thinks is doing so with experience to draw from and who can and will to us candidly_ on many topics it whole new experience that mp is one of the best links ve found from this site

hm not even sure that is their prophet the author of those sketches usually doesn comment them but rather lets people envision what they choose maybe that exactly the point is that muhammad or not as many people have stressed out how could anyone really tell since depicting him is so taboo as see it it just smart ridicule of the way some people from the islam responded to drawings with violence also it reassures us of our right to free speech as long as we live in country that embraces this right actually didn even think that was muhammad when first saw the cartoon different viewers different perspectives

gt don agree with your examples because muslims have right to be offended about religious things they do have right to be offended but they don have right to react the way that many have and start murdering people rioting and destroying things over it
gt the same people who are currently trying to get flag burning illegalized would be steadily trying to get anti cristian sacreligious speech illegalied here if our constitution was not in place to guarantee the right there is also large contingent of folk that would like to get rid of christian speech that is negative towards any certain people groups
yeah that list still pales in comparison to terrorist acts by muslims heck could find atheist acts of terrorism but they are largely isolated cases and its not something that happens all the time
but hope it goes on and on hope the danes get long hard lesson in how these folks behave is like saying hope that somebody betrays your trust so that you ll realise you made mistake in trusting them wouldn it be better to say hope someone rewards your trust so that you will be justified in having trusted them
guess you can detect sarcasm either the grandparent post was intended as humor the fact of the matter is that islam is religion of violent hegemony american are bowing down to the god of tolerance and living in fear that maybe the muslims will do to america what certain ethnic minority did when katrina destroyed their city

the difference between christians and muslims is that when people who espouse to be christians go on vigilante killing sprees it is in conflict with the very beliefs they profess to believe having identified themselves with christ whereas when muslims go on vigilante killing sprees it is in harmony with the very beliefs they profess to believe having put themselves under the authority of the koran please refer to http www wvinter net haught koran html

found no problems using gmail with opera and opera own user agent identification string as for they hype in this case it is rather justified unlike some of google more lacklustre recent offerings gmail is extremely well designed especially in comparison to its rivals while ajax has probably received undue attention in the case of gmail it really does make significant difference to user experience

naturally you wouldnt give guy negative karma if he only submitted couple articles but if guy constantly has ratings on every post he submits obviously he up to something sure the reddit guys could set it so that it fair
wrote the author an email it went first of all in most markets he doesn charge anything if newspaper can stand on it own two feet without distribution monopoly or duopoly then it shouldn exist we have funny thing called free markets in america and while not perfect or complete they seem to work better than central planning second they re working on something new and news related that might just help fledgling journalists and bloggers but you didn mention that so assume you either chose to omit it or just didn do your research go bloggers

something about this rubs me the wrong way namely that can chat with someone have their words in plaintext on my screen and yet that person has the ability to prevent me from keeping log will be able to copy and paste into text file or will have to take screen shot run it through ocr software and save it that way it seems like stupid feature and it makes complicated what should be simple
have to wonder if they realize on conscious level that they are undermining their industry by taking the originality out it is classic example of everyone for themselves everyone is only concerned with their own profit motives so their entire industry as whole suffers for it it would be in their collective best interests to enter into bargain whereby each studio aggrees to spend certain budget on experimental movies

there was bit of contraversy in the washington area couple years back don have links you ll have to do some research yourself at any rate the epa standards for safe water aren quite what you might think the local water company had to test houses for lead levels in the water supply according to the regulations as long as less than of the houses had lead levels above the limit that was ok the kicker is that even if house was above the limit they didn have to tell you that guess there is no substitute for getting your water supply tested in lab and checking the local regulations it your life
this is really bullshit argument if people wanted to use local newspapers they would also there nothing stopping local newspapers from creating local craigslist like sites they could advertise it locally allow free posting on the web and charge little to get it in print or maybe also in rotation on the front page or something but haven seen one doing it
know they re quite comparable and they both piss me off
walk lot through downtown oakland each day and yes they are slobs for reasons cannot fathom it cool to litter here ve seen countless people just toss what they no longer need on the ground it mostly the young but not only get tired of arguing with people about it so just shutup now the peeve have smokers tossing their butts on the ground thinking the entire fucking city is their ashtray wtf there are lack of garbage cans downtown which think is contributing factor the city is saying we don want your garbage so just toss it on the ground
as many of us already know sometimes it possible to love doing lots of different things yet so often the implied question is gt what one thing do you want to be when you grow up what single color is your parachute gt call people with too many interests renaissance souls pointing out that being renaissance soul is fact not flaw when people grasp this they respond with the most incredibly moving emails about how they finally don feel gt broken lt gt odd gt or the infamous gt jack of all trades master of none gt anymore but there still are way too many out there who are not aware of this affirming concept this makes the book the renaissance soul life design for people with too many passions to pick just one great partner book to graham the more of us who spread the word re renaissance souls via blogs online book reviews links on their sites etc the more people we can reach with this affirming paradigm shift this is definitely going to be word of mouth process since much of the media still haven caught on to the power of this information and the number of people out there searching for it likewise random house broadway publishers of my book have only allocated the minimum of funds for publicity so thanks in advance for anything you do to help the concept of renaissance souls reach its tipping point

nobody is forcing the people of burlington vt or wherever craigslist is to use the service they use it because presumably they like it better than the alternatives if you don like craigslist don use it if you don like starbucks or home depot then don go there but if lots of other people do like these establishments then what can you really say guess you can complain lot about how people have their priorities mixed up but you can just force everyone to feel exactly the same way you do
the holocaust is one of the more touchy subjects in terms of free speech in the free world iirc there are laws in france and germany prohibiting the sale dissemination of nazi doctrine ie mein kampft et al not sure if it made it into law but holocaust denial attaches massive stigma to any proponents so in the eyes of the offended islamists anti zionists the holocaust is the easiest and best target for like for like retalitation

leds are expensive and here why you make em on wafers which means you ve got to go through couple of cycles of bake photoresist develop dope anneal etch each one of those requires big infrastructure furnaces ion implanters nasty chemicals chemical weapons grade nasty in sometimes and it all has to be done in cleanroom this is going to be like making solar panels but more expensive because silicon semiconductors don emit light and light emitting semiconductor materials gallium indium are much more difficult to work with when you re done you wind up with few wafers on the order of four square feet even if you get area improvement from packaging and mounting the dice that plural for die chip you still put in lot more effort than you would to produce an equivalent number of incandescent lightbulbs even if your leds last times as long leds like dc at low voltage optimally about volts existing electrical apparatus is ac can elaborate on this topic for looong time if anyone is curious suffice it to say that you have to either accept shorter lifetime for your diodes by having them turn on amp off all the time wasting power too or you have to convert your power into low voltage high current which dissipates lot of heat the other option is to have little dc voltage regulator for each diode which means more silicon see above the light is nasty all monochrome we only get few colors to mix together and it harder than with fluorescent lights because you re mixing discrete solid state devices instead of different gases in tube this link http ledmuseum home att net ledrgb htm is kind of interesting if you re interested so unfortunately leds are prbably never going to be uesful as light sources except for things like emergency flashlights small amounts of light to keep your rod vision working rather than large amounts of light to saturate your environment and keep you in good mood
good lord open your eyes you are being manipulated just as the muslims are being manipulated by their imams who are playing on their prejudices as much as the media is playing on yours the op ed reads like those wwii articles about the savage japs and you are lapping it up like good soldier what they are doing is intolerable violence is intolerable so is willful ignorance such as you painting an entire cluture of hundreds of millions of people with one brush in fact it the ignorance that leads to the violence

the problem with starbucks and home depot is that often after few years there nowhere else left to go there no good reason the local newspaper couldn have started its own community site before craigslist moved in it not exactly hard to write the code for that kind of site and it not new idea craigslist has been around over years if you get everyone using your community site before craigslist opens page for your town you can charge small fee for some of the more popular categories
alright so this is just like when the wwii media wrote about savage japs ll take your premise so then you think it would have been better to do nothing about the real japanese threat in wwii and let their empire conquer and subjugate manchuria china and possibly as much of the world as they could or should we have fought back against an enemy and tried to defend ourselves the japanese weren evil the muslim countries are not evil the japanese however did decide before wwii that they were better than everybody else and that they will go ahead and prove this by conquering as much of asia and the world as they could and imposing their rule on the people living there that exactly what the muslims want to do now their leaders quite often have proclaimed that they want to destroy us and cover the entire world with their brand of fascist fanatical islam where all jew and chrisitians will be killed and all women subjugated we need to show them quite clearly that this isn going to happen and then when they ve acknowledged our right to exist and do what we want to do in our own countries they will be as welcomed into the world community as the japanese are now
gt perhaps you have just misread likely think we got confused somewhere for the record since network delivered text often fails to activate our empathic social interaction ganglia when verbalizing these posts to myself as write them use civil tone but ve got to take issue with one of your quotes on the grounds that it contains assumptions that privilege an atheistic viewpoint gt gt skeptics engaged in debate with apologists tend to expect apologetics to consist of powerful arguments intended to persuade skeptics and are sometimes surprised by the failure of these arguments to even approach this goal occasionally it because the apologist just isn any good most often though it because the arguments only had the purpose of giving current believers license to continue believing since skeptics are not the intended target at all these arguments aim for much lower burden not trying to do more than make the religious belief plausible or cast doubt on skeptical arguments emphasis is mine read that as some apologetics aren very good and others are less interested in truth than in propping up their preconceptions this isn debate it genteel mud slinging and since it purports to explian the intellectual and social function of whole class of people you could even call it bigoted gt in the modern sense of the word god where all that is left of god is concept that by definition can not be reasoned about how do you separate things are subject to reason reasonable from things that are not unreasonable certainly the status of being neither demonstably true nor demonstrably false is insufficient to declare that an idea unreasonable in mathematics the axiom of choice falls into this category some theorists assert others assert not and both are reasonable the existence of real numbers limits calculus is predicated on the former choice and much important work in computability theory rests on the latter so think you have to do some more work than just claiming that god is malformed idea some people seem able to assume the existence of actors or agentive observers involved in the origin of the universe and reason effectively if not always correctly from there other people assert that there are no such entities and reason effectively if not always correctly from there both systems of thinking occasionally produce interesting results and both systems could turn out to be wrong if for example the universe has no beginning or end in time where the problem

short answer leds are in principle even more monochromatic than fluorescent bulbs think that in this context you have to assume people are willing to pay extra for the new bulb whether it led or cf or something else if so they can get fluorescents with better phosphors and ballasts that all but eliminate the pasty white flickering light of cheap fluorescents in the near term the extra cost of leds is never recovered in energy savings compared to using cf bulbs in some cases it cheaper to make an led that emits uv and coat it with phosphors than to blend few colors of led to try and get white light it is an active area of research though and expect we ll be switching to leds within ten years

exactly right the way this should work is energy prices should rise when generators are being pushed to the limit causing homes and businesses to wish to conserve energy during precisely those times when energy is scarce then all those people would eventually buy fluorescent bulbs of their own accord unfortunately in ontario at least residential electricity prices are being controlled by the government no politician could get elected on plan to eliminate these price controls so people get the wrong price signal on electricity oh but we could fix this problem by making it illegal to buy incandescent light bulbs people in possession of them would be sent to work camps for the rest of their lives in fact why stop there why not plan the whole economy that always worked in the past right

disagree on both points as user think the purity of reddit ranking system is big part of what makes it good site sure ve wanted to rewrite somebody title or un linkjack post but don think giving people that ability just because they constantly watch rss feeds for joelonsoftware com and paulgraham com so they can get karma is good idea don think giving popular users the ability to edit other people posts would cause geek articles to score any higher than they do currently suspect if anything hackers are more likely to be fair moderators not saying that any current users with high karma are guilty of this but it is cheap and effective way to get there

think the real reason to go off the record is so that your logs dont get indexed with the rest of your google stuff dont know if googlebots look through chat content right now but if you store it in gmail they sure as hell will they are trying to draw attention away from the logging done by them and make it seem like they are being champions of privacy by letting you control who logs the convo it is silly because once you send that text message the other person has it chose to go off the record because say lot more dumb shit on im then do in email and don want that aggregated altho im probably being pretty silly in that you either go secure and private or you dont

western countries want to rule the world too most of them did at some point how many times have governments been overthrown because their leaders were not properly obedient to the us or the soviet union the current us president is not shy about his plans to subvert the governments of many countries around the world always for the best of reasons you understand always the problem isn muslims the problem is governments of all stripes trying to rule the world to that end they use propaganda to turn their people against the current enemy to think of them as less than human if muslims are not evil calling them evil uncivilized etc as many people are doing is false right is it acceptable to just go with dangerous lie not to me during wwii tens of thousands of us citizens were rounded up amp their lives destroyed simply because they were japanese the united states is the first amp only country to use nuclear weapons on civilian population and that supposedly the war with the least moral ambiguity war degrades everybody are you seriously saying we should go through that again just roll over and take it because standing up and thinking for yourself is too damned hard are you sure that we are not being pushed as much as they are

there is huge gulf between wide scale and angry protests and the type of violence that is taking place in multiple countries in europe and the middle east they aren at all comparable would be ecstatic to see the muslim mobs peacefully demonstrating that was more due to the order of our society than the the sic protesters controlling themselves it is notable that you offer no argument or evidence whatsoever to back up this rather strong assertion if it were true then why weren christians in societies less ordered than ours resorting to violence after all we haven seen peaceful demonstrations confined to ordered denmark have we

the article says in the first place it wouldn actually matter if it were true that we have shortage of folks who know math and science in the us the whole point of the international division of labor is that we benefit from the skills of everyone around the world really suspect that we don want to be on the countries that don do math and science end of this equation this whole international division of labor things seems like bad idea really it seems that we have people who have variety of skills interests and abilities in the us or any nation for that matter and to say oh you re good at math and science well you best move to china or india because those are the places that specialize in those skills here we do marketing is very bad idea if you believe in this international division of labor then it basically means that in any nation you ll have large numbers of people who won be able to fit into highly specialized society which has no room for their skills it also means that if some disaster comes up where you can communicate or trade with other regions for time your country will not be able to get essential goods or services think avian flu for example we don make basic medical supplies like masks gloves needles even medicines here anymore so if we find that asia is hit hard by transmission of avian flu our hospitals will quickly run out of these supplies

first let me agree that there is not shortage of people with science degrees then let me immediately emphasize that there is shortage of skilled engineers and scientists see two reasons for this and despite my love for the free market government intervention could in theory actually help it probably won but that because of the incompetence of our government not because it bad idea first some capable americans do not have the opportunity to study science like nerd born in poetistan some potential engineers are born in school districts that inhibit rather than promote math and science education generally the fact that school district has problem is sign that no market force will correct the problem the parents and teachers in the district teach it in painful way because to them it is painful second capable americans with the opportunity to study science or engineering are almost always better off going into business if science was very specialized then the specialization division of labor argument makes sense but in the real world it not question between poetry and math it question between applying rational thought to chemistry biology physics or business and most people who are capable of science are also capable of things that make more money external forces like the government are capable of affecting both problems they can find fund good science teachers and they can artificially reward science over business the reason politicians will screw up any attempt at doing either of those is because there is no measure for good science so you don know if teacher is good science teacher and when you attract capable people headed for business and incapable people headed nowhere you award degrees to all of them and cause unemployment among phds my solution well this post is long enough already
strike the might this specific problem is definitely fixable let user karma go negative and factor user karma into article placement in at least the recommended page if you also require captcha on user registration then it will take most of the spammers out entirely another promising candidate is to have domain level average paulgraham com would have an average of and any site average below would get flagged just not submitted the more general problem of making spam go away is pretty hard think the way to do it is to let people set up filters on submitter karma and then enough people will set the filter above that the spammer would have to do real work to get in another way to go is to make the default page recommended instead of hot this would require making recommended better of course

problem have with this article is that it seems to make the assumption that everyone is rational and has perfect knowledge it seems to me that the reason that one says something like we are running out of mathematicians and scientists and we need them is to fight the people saying no one should be mathematician or scientist because your job will just go to india the purpose is to sway public opinion into thinking that these are worthwhile jobs again there isn any real messing with market forces it is really just move to get people to remember that we will always need mathematicians and scientists and there will always be jobs for them in america regardless of india
this article reminded me of lecture by leonard peikoff on government involvement in healthcare http www capmag com article asp id
heh the countries with strong laws against holocaust denial france germany and believe russia not sure if holocaust denial is prohibited but do recall it is illegal to own copy of mein kampf in russia are some of the softest relatively speaking in regards to iran think the holocaust denial angle is what may have pushed russia into condemning iraq with the un vote etc while russia no longer has large jewish community million russian civilians were killed by germans so they re not going to take lightly to any diminuition of nazi evil denmark where the cartoons were published does not have laws against holocaust denial so in turn iran desired response would not happen iran printing holocaust cartoons is nothing out of the ordinary given anti semetic caricatures that appear on regular basis in middle eastern press this will only further alienate iran from any sympathyit may have had in europe especially france germany and russia
no one claimed that people laughed non stop for months know that what meant when said it was implausible but the first answer he gave implied and would leave an unbiased reader to believe that it was continuous months of yucks because he didn add any qualifiers until later
all votes are equal
well there you go so now the question is why
now jews will vandalize property and assault people in response to cartoons the world will see that any group of people resonds to offensive speech with violence just like muslims do this is iran plan right
don you know that how they can claim that israel existed as jewish state prior to both the first use of the word palestine and the invention of islam
why not
you are making valid point it sure isn the first time cartoons depicting islam dogmas in less than favourable ways are showed and they sure aren the most offensive ones not to mention that they were printed in september last year the chosen timing of this outburst is suspicious to say the least
dead link
why ask why ask why ask why but really because people who post things that other people like should be better judge of what is good
thanks
other less influential users will frequently attach themselves to the growth trend of post and drive it higher in the rankings don buy this people vote for what they actually like and dislike that the beauty of the system
but most people tend to select posts to vote for or against only from what is already in the first few pages of the hot section so what hot might become hotter but it only gets hot because of the early influencers
and the reason of shortage is government regulation not free market if you had free market in schools there would not be shortage in engineers unless beeing nuclear scientist is such loosy low paid job you leave it to chineese
the central planning approach to boosting science was tried and failed in every totalitarian country and the same will be true in nominally free ones as well yeah those soviets had really lousy science program
my contempt for the bushies is boundless
there are not many countries that don believe in international division of labor north korea is most prominent http en wikipedia org wiki autarky

many actually praise the planned command aspects of the us economy for this for instance bill gates dad let talk about the question of why people are wealthy there is myth that it function of enormous personal attributes there myth that achieving wealth is function of personal intelligence and energy and thus that the product of that intelligence and energy being wealth is the sole and exclusive possession of the person who developed and earned it and that myth is so egregious it just egregious the individual wealth which is generated in this economy is in my judgment and doubt that there is much that anyone could disagree with about this is function of the innovative businesses which are created as result of federal research but you understand that the people who benefit from that research get it free so if somebody starts software company or biotechnology company or even if somebody owns building in downtown washington which you rent to those people it starts from the same place it starts from this incredible research activity which is going on with federal money bill gates sr http www taxpolicycenter org publications template cfm pubid an nyt article http www nytimes com technology darpa html ex amp en ca efefeb dc amp ei amp partner rssnyt explains that federal research under military spending was vital for the us tech economy ironically it ends with quote from lisp guy john mccarthy seeing that reddit has lots of lisp articles for those who prefer the other ideological end of the spectrum chomsky http www lipmagazine org articles featchomsky_ htm and other leftists http www counterpunch org schaefer html analyze in detail these high tech federal subsidies with essentially the same conclusions as above though claiming that there should have been more democratic control over where this spending went as they probably consider people like gates son leeches however many claim that that some form of federal spending is vital for the economy even in the form of military as the economy would fail otherwise
gt the fact that school district has problem is sign that no market force will correct the problem could it be that schools are not good enogh because they are public gt they can artificially reward science over business when you regulate best people from business to science you no longer have enough skilled people in business this artifical shortage will need compensation too intervention is not the answer

many people accept that division of labor carries useful benefits but it has dire consequences which should be understood adam smith claimed http www econlib org library smith smwn html ch of the expences of the sovereign or commonwealth that under division of labor workers eventually become as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for human creature to become the torpor of his mind renders him not only incapable of relishing or bearing part in any rational conversation but of conceiving any generous noble or tender sentiment and consequently of forming any just judgment concerning many even of the ordinary duties of private life of the great and extensive interests of his country he is altogether incapable of judging and unless very particular pains have been taken to render him otherwise he is equally incapable of defending his country in war the uniformity of his stationary life naturally corrupts the courage of his mind and makes him regard with abhorrence the irregular uncertain and adventurous life of soldier it corrupts even the activity of his body and renders him incapable of exerting his strength with vigour and perseverance in any other employment than that to which he has been bred his dexterity at his own particular trade seems in this manner to be acquired at the expence of his intellectual social and martial virtues but in every improved and civilized society this is the state into which the labouring poor that is the great body of the people must necessarily fall unless government takes some pains to prevent it here globalization faq http www zmag org zmag articles jan albert htm from the leftists these leftists seem to believe wholeheartedly in globalization but not the specific kind we usually hear about in the press also we should look at the one sentence in adam smith most famous book where he actually mentions the invisible hand by preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry he intends only his own security and by directing that industry in such manner as its produce may be of the greatest value he intends only his own gain and he is in this as in many other cases led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention so we need nuanced non religious understanding as to what he really intended with the invisible hand metaphor

could it be that schools are not good enough because they are public well that depends thomas jefferson hs in fairfax county va is probably better than most or all of the year private schools in the area ditto the math science magnet at montgomery blair hs in montgomery county md as pl suggests the school districts to great degree reflect the voting population there are places where low taxes is the gospel and low sats are more tolerable than football season there are other places where parents camp out overnight to enroll junior in the pre french immersion program find the latter charmingly neurotic but the schools are better
so now we are playing game of whose religion is more depraved unfortunately that is the game being played when people try to equivocate extremely isolated events of violence against abortion clinics which all the same condemn anthrax threats scary for all we know it was one guy and historical events from the never suggested it didn happen just that it was historical event could point to the multiple not one actual acts not threats of violence within the last several days not from the committed in the name of islam completely baffled by your assertion that scale does not matter let say there were two societies and that were roughly the same size if society had violent crimes per year and society had then don think that most reasonable people would object to saying that society was the more violent of the two scale does matter so please let not equivocate let condemn all violence if there happens to have been all kind of violence perpetrated by muslims in the last few days don see why we need to try and gloss over or soften that fact by trying to grasp for incidents when christians or jews or hindus or whatever different religious groups people have been bringing up were violent ll condemn those actions when they happen but let face the present reality with honesty let go of the hate man who do hate if my response came across as hateful then sincerely apologize am truly trying to keep all my comments as anti cable talk show as can would never suggest that muslims cannot have the same fears amp motivations as do only that they aren currently reacting how would do you think ve never been religiously offended have did react violently not in the least believe that you are sincere in your reluctance to judge the mobs of offended and sincerely committed muslims but am not afraid to make value judgement their actions not their persons are inferior to the way that western society would have reacted to the same stimuli would there have been an angry reaction in the us if we took out mohammed face and put in christ yes would there have been violence maybe would it have remotely approached the level of violence going on now of course not if you really believe otherwise then guess you and will have to agree to disagree in all sincerity thank you for the respectful discussion

except that she didn say that but it was caused to very bad translation of the danish word modspil which means something along the lines of play against as in football the bad translation has been widely reported in the danish press but maybe because of the low number of journalists in the english speaking world who understand danish there doesn seem to be many articles mentioning the bad translation the only one ve found is this http www statesman com news content shared gen ap europe html search for opposition to islam in the page to see it the more cynical side of me though think that journalists as the submitter guess like the opposition statement better it grabs attention which sells more copies while the correct version wouldn sell as well
definitely not made up friend of mine had very similar story psychiatrists do worry very much about weight gain side effects apart from not wanting to prescribe someone diabetes and heart disease the reasoning is along the lines that being overweight will cause long term stress and can contribute to social isolation stress often being major precipitative factor in these kinds of condition
regarding your citations forgive me but cannot connect this mentally with the topic what has torpor of xviiith century worker mind to do with free movement of labor and goods your faq proposes gt remuneration according to effort and sacrifice jobs balanced for quality of life and empowerment plus workers and consumers council democracy and participatory cooperative social planning rather than individualist corporatist competitive market exchange but afair all those ideas were thoroughly exercised in soviet union not long ago
oh gawd it easier to talk about revolutionary consumer electronics that the soviets didn invent than it is to talk about revolutionary heart surgeries genetic engineering techniques skyscraper construction techniques or housepaint that the soviets didn invent in fact other than rockets nukes military hardware and basically free research like abstract mathematics and theoretical physics the sovs weren good at innovating much at all
that what most people expect improvement better quality of life
ugh my censor comment was in response to something stated in the content of the actual article jimmy and not the article assume you mean and not the headline your sentence about censoring quoted the headline not the article and was immediately followed by sentence in the same paragraph directly stating that it was an intentionally misleading headline and if you now want to claim that that immediately following sentence in the same paragraph was unrelated to the previous one despite the fact that the previous one quoted the headline and not the article please further note that that implies that the immediately following sentence in the same paragraph gives absolutely no reason for its claim in short either bull or learn to use paragraphs and to quote what you re talking about instead of what you now claim you are not talking about the joint chiefs of staff can express the personal political opinions however they want as group with their titles attached or not it very common to do so the military is generally highly cautious about its officer corps issuing political statements witness the general boykin believe who recently got officially reprimanded after saying something to the effect of jesus is going to kick allah ass for not making it absolutely explicit that he was speaking merely his personal opinion and not in his capacity as general he wasn officially reprimanded because he spoke his personal political opinion he welcome to speak his personal political opinion he wasn officially reprimanded because he hatemongering religious wackjob he welcome to be hatemongering religious wackjob he was officially reprimanded because he issued personal political opinion without making it explicitly clear that he was not speaking in his capacity as general and this is for good reason whether you pretend it not fact or not political opinions issued by high ranking military officials can have serious chilling effect our military is intended to serve the people many nations are not so lucky in this respect our military is historically and in general careful to avoid even the slightest appearance of such attempting to rightfully be officially neutral with respect to american politics until now

agree schools are not good enough because they are public teachers unions don help either good luck changing that but even if schools were subject to the free market bad school would indicate market failure and if you wanted to change it you have to change the market artificially as an engineer very biased and think of course we should be proactive on every other issue my health the environment etc take wait and see approach and maybe the bad effects will never come so maybe you ve uncovered little of my bias there to your second point while intervening might not be the best approach do believe that it can be done effectively as mentioned above we re just too used to seeing incompetent politicians do it poorly and we ve lost hope that it could ever be done effectively if there were big revolution and every state became an autonomous nation for instance you see many of them intervening in the market effectively for ten or twenty years and then they would become corrupt too because non corrupt governments are inherently unstable think about it
the general drift of comments is that these atrocities were somehow unprecendented and out of proportion and there no way to analyse it except to say islamofacists first we have to remember that this kind of violence is not too far from the surface of most societies amp let not get into homicide rates in the us you seem to agree there many people delude themselves about their own tribe wisdom amp restraint myself included as it turned out think the muslim reaction is so the key question is why think it being fueled by opportunists to tighten their hold on these people will lord knows they have been told for decades about how evil the west is and we haven given them much reason to believe otherwise there is lot of pent up anger over there it not beyond comprehension we are at critical point in history was deeply insulted by the original article it is clumsy screed that paints muslims as irrational violent ciphers who are out to get us us being the stalwart members of all other faiths who never ha stoop to violence it uses textbook call to arms rhetoric designed to provoke the reader our sacred beliefs are under attack we must resist this threat we must oh why that exactly what the imams are saying to the rioting muslims you get it it set up after the initial shock got another one the number of folk who were taken in by it irony deficient people who have no clue about the world beyond the end of their nose who apparently believe there are no muslims living in europe or that this somehow justifies general war against islam thank you too
thought this was an interesting article suppose had heard that there are different types of homeless but it seems much more useful to classify by homeless pattern than affliction if so many people are only homeless for day or two it shows how much good the shelters and soup kitchens are doing the chronic homeless are the most visible problem and also the problem not fixed by those shelters or soup kitchens these are the people that there is no good answer for you dont just let them die that doesn fit into most peoples moral code if you keep things the way they are they keep costing so much year this is the first ive heard of such solution and it is an interesting way to think

just disagree with the idea that word can technically be word or not be the oed is strictly descriptivist it tells you what people write and have written someone used the word truthiness in the that doesn make it more of word than if no one ever had it doesn make it less of one either the wordiness of word can be judged by the reactions that english speaking people have to it particularly the english speaking people you re using it on truthiness probably won stick because people will use it only for jokes the ada voted truthiness the word of the year not most likely to succeed which award went to sudoku but it english after all it not up to me whether the word sticks around just whether use it

that because people like this guy don pay isn that like saying the pricetag at department store doesn reflect it actual cost or do misunderstand your point
did read the story sure he says install firewall etc then he goes on to say how hackers can easily bypass personal firewalls what help is that he offering solution that he admits doesn work
an excellent rebuttal to many of the myths so common blame hollywood amp the victorians
yes when an item at department store gets stolen the cost of the goods is counted as the loss not the price of the goods when drunk doesn pay medical bill the cost to the hospital is not and the government doesn reimburse the hospital however there is real cost ve yet to find hospital that actually knows what it is the problem is concluding for example that year real costs social program is cheaper than year medical bill don know if it is and don know if it isn do know that can conclude that it is still like the article just don want people to think that the savings are that obvious

good point but what about the non financial opportunity costs the patient who had to sit in the waiting room because there were no beds left or the emotional toll on the nurses who were about to quit if someone would have stayed in bed and paid the full but didn because of the homeless guy was in it then there is financial cost as well
this is exactly why socialized medicine doesn work though german doctors are heading to britain just wait they ll all be headed over to the us soon enough doctors are one of those little known imports that the us takes up the pay is so much better here health care in my opinion is also better here in britain expect to wait few weeks for an mri and if you have cancer just pray

thanks ton have some karma
yeah hospitals in the us generally are not full so that is not really the problem if hospital had to open an otherwise closed floor because of an excess of this type of patient that would be large cost like the emotional toll idea but the article had nurse meeting her husband because of drunk err perhaps marriage is the emotional toll oh and the patient who is insured and is in the next night bed his insurance company is only going to pay about hospital accounting is strange world unto itself

hmm those leftists who made the faq seem to be strongly against the soviets practices many denunciations of marxism leninism if you explore their site further don know your economics background but in my intro econ classes and suspect occasionally in pop econ mags like the economist adam smith is frequently invoked when explaining division of labor and globalization but selectively so in fact had to correct the wikipedia article on the invisible hand as they carefully elided the part of the sentence which mentions preferring domestic investment as for the applicability of th century enlightenment ideas to modern times you might look at smith words predicting that an advanced society will drive towards this crippling division of labor and note things like assembly lines and taylorism david noble discusses http nooranch com synaesmedia wiki wiki cgi davidnoble this sorta thing interestingly think

while agree that his attempts at censoring indicate that he clearly is not fit candidate for his job fail to see how him holding piece of paper or not puts more perspective on this situation it seems to me that he would have attempted to introduce the same censorship if he would have graduated from uni know quite few people that never got their uni degrees who are brilliant at what they do just as know enough people that did get their degree who are just plain daft in light of this fail to see how having degree should be some kind of minimum requirement time to mod me down now edit it does shed some light on some of the information that we are presented with as being true though but it hardly amazes me anymore that something like this would surface
you worthless shameless spammer stop posting your lame stories or don post blogs the english language is in constant flux the words spam and spammer can take meanings other than unsolicted commercial email and making few cents from google ads is spammer getting story to the front page of digg drives serious traffic and potentially more than few cents but there are also less tangible gains namely fame notoriety higher standing in the blogosphere which btw in turn drives more traffic perhaps shameless self promoter is more appropriate if you want to stick to pure interpretation of the word spam ie monetary gains

not proposing that the us not trade with the rest of the world what saying is that there are some areas you just don want to give up on the us shouldn give up on math science and engineering in favor of marketing and burger flipping math science and engineering are essential for longterm economic success in technological society giving up on them because some group of economists says that they just don fit in our piece of the international division of labor pie anymore just seems foolish and will likely lead to rd world status for the us in couple of generations however bush plan to reinvigorate math and science education falls flat his budget actually cuts student loans and research money preferring instead to keep the iraq debacle going

that poor girl was dead the moment the those cowards decided to rape her in iran it works like this if you get raped you get sentenced to death if you defend yourself you get sentenced to death now that one country just begging for regime change if you ask me ve always been against the war in iraq but must say find it hard to have sympathy with iran if one could just take the innocent civilians out of the equation say bomb the bastards before breakfast tomorrow
the thing is we don have the resources nor the political capital given the mess we ve made in iraq to pursue military option in iraq or north korea both countries which it turns out are lot more dangerous that iraq has been for while oops setting aside for the moment whether you want to in any case

this story is indeed horrible but don like the fact that it is obviously abused here as propaganda against the islam in the context of the caricature issue btw sure that pretty much nobody would care if the innocent victim was an old man it makes me bitter to see that it is way easier to trigger peoples sense of justice by referring to cases involving pretty young girls btw don forget that the us does sentence people to death as well and it is proven fact that at least some of the victims were innocent too
wish they worded the headline differently it it weren from nasa gov would have dismissed it as one of those nasa saw aliens but won tell us posts
just to shed some light on the matter women are allowed to defend themselves against rape and among other dangers in general in fact in the time of the prophet pbuh women who chose to accompany armies were welcome to fight also really don like the idea of the prophet pbuh mainly being described as woman hater by people whose education on the subject tends to be quite dodgy in fact even western female writers have described the prophet pbuh as one of the earliest feminists someone who fought for the rights of women and islam true islam that is does give women many more rights than any other mainstream religion can think off how muslims choose to use the religion for their own purposes shouldn be platform to abuse the religion itself or the prophet pbuh really not quite sure which brand of islam the iranian rulers follow
lisp macros aren general functional programming concept but it seems mean spirited for python to not just keep the functional stuff and also it would be nice if they expanded lambda to deal with arbitrary bodies of code instead of just one liners my choice of ruby over python for web development was strongly motivated by pythons resistance to functional style

run through the tests and got fedora wtf and debian prefer slackware not even in the proposal list freebsd and solaris over linux distribution leafy bushes why someone skilled to run such tests anyway if he knows the answers
actually the historical records persist in showing grand total of victims at salem you suggest it happened many times suppose we have to define what many constitutes to you be little more careful about going to the historical record if were you before you ve done lot more reading that because this is subject that know far more about than you do oh by the way those trials took place during far less enlightened age mullahs are still encouraging the mutilation and stoning of women in so sorry thanks for playing but again we have apples and oranges sit down middle eastern women thousands and thousands of them have been stoned hanged and murdered because of tyrannical muslim rule these are not people who either comprehend or assimilate justice mercy or righteousness

christians or any other religious groups who do not believe in global climate change and evolution do not rape and kill innocent teenage girls no they don they blindly plow ahead with destructive thoughtless policies which will make the earth uninhabitable for our children they preach abstinence over contraception to control aids and unwanted pregnancy to millions of americans and africans despite the overwhelming evidence that this doesn work they go to war senselessly and cause the deaths of thousands of people and further destabilize one of the most dangerous regions in the world and they can do this because they have the unerring conviction that they re right it groundless but that doesn matter to these delusionals all that matters is that god told them to do it religion is evil it irrational and delusional and causes needless hate and intolerance

oh by the way those trials took place during far less enlightened age and you think it more enlightened age now purely because of the passage of time the reason america is more enlightened now is because it moved away from theocracy it sinking back at the moment but it still aways from iran in the th century the muslim world was the height of culture science and humanity
cory novels are average and so are his tv reviews the screamingly funny running gag about fire that broken out in the basement will probably give most geeks very brief chuckle but this show isnt really all that funny so glad that this show exists ve waited all my life for truly geeky comedy and think that this is it real geeks appreciate real humor not token geek comedy frankly its an insult to suggest that geeks may actually find this funny dont think we ll even see the end of this series certainly wont synopsis pathetic
all you proved is that it happened in america years ago it doesn prove it would happen today and while america was as you claim theocracy is stopped the witch trials and condemned them
well it more enlightened in america don you think no more witch trials for one thing
laws vary from state to state but in most areas there is essentially no competition between public schools and vouchers are considered this results in the present situation where in some areas relatively little is spent on education and those with money and an interest in their kids future send them to private school there are some areas with good public schools but those tend to be the so called blue states bear in mind also the term public school has the opposite meaning in britian and america

from the article deutsch former coworker informed me that in the summer of when deutsch was the opinion editor for the battalion he was offered position in george bush presidential reelection campaign this does in no way indicate to me that he lied on his resume about getting ba in journalism in fact it seems more likely that the guy that offered him position for the reelection campaign would have been in the know about the fact that he was still attending uni as opposed to having graduated from it from the article at this point while am unaware of whether deutsch graduated from college at all it is clear that he did not graduate from amp and he may have intentionally misled people to believe that he did possible maybe even plausible but speculation at best also regarding his position at nasa as far as knew he was appointed by the bush administration the same people that hired him earlier

don think python does reject functional stuff the only changes that have been discussed are rearranging the syntax and sugar for them nothing about lambda affects things like closures etc def does and always will support this the objection to lambda is just that it is ugly and limited compared to function not because of any dislike for functional style oddly one of the reasons prefer python to ruby is that prefer pythons syntax for functional style arguing that map is less functionally correct than list comprehensions is as silly as arguing that ruby is not functional because it lacks first class functions in both cases the underlying concepts are there and are what matters ps to contradict srid python programmer and would love lisp style macros in python though don think they can really fit in as well as with lisp due to the non sexp syntax then again also glad lambda is staying its convenient for small adapters and callbacks even if it is ugly
come on people this story should be true because well read it on the internet look at the site http www faithfreedom org testimonials htm testimonials of who left islam is it not possible that this could be fud site against islam don buy into this story

agree they definately are not more clear to use except occasionally not to mention python lambda is already very limited
good spot ment christianity it is true that mosques are being built which is good thing am definitely for religious freedom do think however that young muslims whos ansestors are muslims are not as orthodox as their ansestors in my admittedly limited experiance children of muslim families in the uk are much less religious than their parents

good to hear that you care for all the other innocent victims as well really but you surely agree that we see exactily this story of this young girl bubbeling up on reddit and not other stories about the many other victims of studipdity and hate who loose their lives every day my suspicion here is that this story is so hot on reddit because it effectively renders the image of muslims as the guys that like to torture the innocent this simplification is invalid and conducive only to stoking fear and hate as everybody very concerned about the recent events in the middle east but as well concerned about many of the reactions observable in the western societies because many people and media here contribute to extreme emotional escalation which makes it all even worse if we consider ourselfs ethically superior we shouldn be participants of this escalation

with you part of my fascination with reddit is watching how the community votes and what that means about the community there is clearly politically left bent but so far without much of the fanaticism of many other forums blogs etc most online venues are at least somewhat left and why is that exactly or am just sheltered from the political right there is the lisp thing and now python guess but am hoping that reddit achieves critical mass and it does appear to be growing quickly even in the short four weeks since ve been looking and focuses on more mainstream issues which also appears to be happening

good point just caught that myself minute ago this article says into spanish but other articles such as the economist one actually say as spain it ambiguous but either way it startling statistic factor of also from having lived and traveled extensively in latin america always looking for good bookstores and hardly finding any my guess would be that most translation into spanish occurs in spain rather than latin america
apart from the fact that the us doesn have to execute anyone at all the point made here is that they were executing mentally handicapped until last year the fact that such morally sadistic practise was only just banned is hardly an indicator that inhumane punishment just wouldn happen the iranian story is appalling and similar kinds of things can be found in our own back yards albeit in different forms think they are symptoms of failing legal systems rather than some kind of inherent immorality in islam of course by not separating law and religion you are bound to have one taint the other

reddits readership seems to have bias towards the leftwing and liberalism also there seems to be proatheist leaning as well would argue this goes with liberalism but let not all of this comes from simple fact reddit readers are smart we hold the values of smart people this pushes us leftwards and away from god obviously this is sweeping statement and is subject to host of caveats and qualifiers like for the most part and in general but you get the gyst don know in what sense you mean dangerous it doesn seem as dangerous as say having religious fundamentalist leading country

okay if this wouldve been more clearly mentioned in the linked article then it would have made better point as it stands though the original article did not explicitly mention this there was link to the ny times but refuse to register there and even if it wouldn require registration still believe that this fact is important enough to have been included in the linked article anyway thanks for enlightening me
look into pebble bed reactors you might be surprised

gt it shows that he is completely unqualified to edit scientific paper find this to be debatable would him having degree in show that he is qualified to edit scientific paper gt it also shows that the person who appointed him is incompetent as well since this relies on the first statement being true find it to be debatable as well
sorry having little trouble following your argument you support religious freedom but you re glad that you preceive christianity to be drying up in the uk you re glad to see new mosques constructed but only because you believe young muslims are more likely to reject their parents faith think you re trying to toe too many lines here man if you rather see the world areligious you need to need to have the balls to say so and not pretend that you support islam on the side which given the topic of the story being discussed is little bit ironic
the iranian story is appalling and similar kinds of things can be found in our own back yards albeit in different forms what form were you thinking of

vote this story up just single paper staff doing what right is not nearly enough to change america but it far more than expected well done
think said obviously this is sweeping statement and is subject to host of caveats and qualifiers like for the most part and in general but you get the gyst and as for being smart pushing you leftwards have no scientific evidence but my experience of the politics of people in academic institutions gives me at least circumstantial evidence and categorical did not say no possible way non atheist could be smart this is patently false pretty much everyone pre and stephen hawking being counterexamples so fair enough attack my position but don put words in my mouth
the reddit headline even the telegraph headline are somewhat misleading in today context the author explains he doesn know if the comments he hears to this effect are representative of the population these sentiments are also expressed around euphoric april which appears to be april the date saddam hussein was deposed http en wikipedia org wiki april_ optimism about us invasions may have cooled since then

except quality of life measures usually tend to dilute per capita income don care how many intangibles you think are important life is better with annual income than with annual income and don start talking about that overworked american http economist com world na displaystory cfm story_id nonsense either it pure egotism americans like to think of themselves as hard working and europeans like to think that their inability to pay for dishwashers and clothes dryers somehow makes their life more idyllic
what the difference between blogger who has few site ads and cnn com with more ads generating more revenue it should all be content related if the content is bad the blogger will not get traffic or ad clicks so shameless self promotion hardly fits the mold of most bloggers if blogger takes the time to write decent story and somebody is motivated to click an ad because of interest generated by the story then what the hell is the problem
indeed per capita gdp is misleading term wonder how much of that gdp is concentrated in the wealthiest
the problem with your theory is that it assumes that reddit readers can tell that you ve submitted your own links before modding them down does that really happen seriously doubt anyone would be bothered to click through to user home page to determine this based on my own behaviour on reddit admittedly not good metric think many users tend to mod down any submitted link that is obviously blog if it hosted by blogger typepad or even wordpress forget about gaining karma why well there are enough blogs out there now to choke an elephant do we really need another tech political or financial blog many of them are just mutual admiration societies and quite incestuous do need to find out every day who robert scoble had dinner with the night before don but if you do you can mod those links up think it far more interesting when people completely outside of the geek and political world discover blogging http www englishcut com what we need is broadening of content and aggregation thereof thankfully this is starting to happen on reddit remember not so long ago months when reddit was primarly lisp python paul graham guy kawasaki link farm not very interesting if you work in another realm or have other interests things got better because the user base expanded good scale disagree about the link on the user page though if you re going to have karma it makes sense from design pov that it be reddit centric and based on the quality of the links you submit than the quality of your offsite weblog of course if you re well known enough paul graham joel spolsky you can obviate that by using your real name and probably generate some personality based karma
in the long term the problems may self correct take an example from history the collapse of the ussr the oil wells won pump out money forever and when they run dry the local economy will tank there isn much industry other than petroleum have you ever seen cheap plastic toy stamped made in saudi arabia and the power base will go down with it however this won happen for many decades leaving plenty of time for an arab nation or subgroup to get their hands on nuclear weapon don think the western world the us specifically though expect israel to have voice here will stand for this and the entire area may end up under what amounts to colonial rule again

one question needs to be answered does the reddit recomendation engine work based on the content of the articles you mod up or down or does it work based on finding other people who like and dislike the same things as you and recomending more of what they like
um to those who say the big bang is only theory you re wrong the big bang is an observed fact directly observable phenomena sp indicate there was central point of origin for all matter in the universe and that we seem to be drifting away from that point still carried by our inertia of the explosion as to why there was big bang or what existed beforehand is only scientific peer review theory and to the people who bring the up the question of the degree yes its obvious that at this guy didn know science from hole in the ground it wouldn have helped him however governments set standards for employment for example to be defense contractor and write computer software for the government you need degree in computer related field it development comp eng comp sci etc its illegal to hire your newphew because he likes computers and wrote an os that runs on top of python if he only freshmen will this mean the government might not be able to hire all the best and brightest probably but even if that requirement didn exist the best and brightest probably wouldn want ot work on government salary either

that all those counter arguments are based on bad data makes it kind of sad they re so well publicized no one has ever died from the mishandling of nuclear waste ever and our disposal methods aren hard either the waste is sealed inside cement cask and is cooled in swimming pool for months during which time the most dangerously radioactive elements decay into stuff that safer to handle then the casks are placed in field and sit there doing nothing except raising the number of uv and ray photons slightly above the already large number that arrive from the sun or from deep space every second airline pilots amp flight crews get about the same amount of radiation exposure as the people who process these casks because they spend lot of time outside the dense part of the atmosphere and closer to thoes emissions the average sailor on nuclear submarine gets less exposure than either group because he has an extra feet of densely packed molecules between him and the sky no terrorists have ever even tried to steal nuclear waste they be better advised to go after industrial chemicals instead cyanides as compounds etc security could easily be improved by shipping the waste to central storage center which hasn happened because nuclear paranoia has forced us to pursue the embarassment at yucca mountain instead the decision isn between nukes and fossils and nukes and renewables it between technologies that work technologies that might work on large scale and technologies that won nukes and fossils and hydro all work and renewables don yet show me gigawatt wind farm that works for six hours day and ll believe you until then renewables are going to remain something we want rather than something we need and can use

it is indeed racist to assume that every member of some other religious or ethnic group is bad morally deficient or whatever negative stereotype you care to mention but it equally racist to assume that other ethnic groups are universally good it is racist because it supposes that they are too infantile to be autonomous moral agents it supposes that they are not quite full human beings if we are capable of good or evil or wisdom or stupidity then so are they

not to get too far off topic but keep in mind that those executions of the mentally retarded in the were of as far as know criminals who were not mentally retarded when they committed the crime for which they were convicted see http en wikipedia org wiki so you re going to execute murderer and that more or less okay but then he tries to kill himself and botches the job making himself retarded and now he should be spared because he is one of the chosen ones the retards that line of thinking makes me sort of queasy so guess some kind of insensitive monster let the down voting begin
unfortunately we seem to demonstrate our capacity for ignorance savagery and hate all the time stories like this just remind me of it see lot of discussion and blame being thrown about christianity vs islam western culture vs middle eastern culture etc but you re going to have hard time convincing me that there any culture that hasn been involved in something pretty despicable in the past or that they aren capable of it in the future so do hate you in particular no but do hate humanity seemingly inherent capacity for barbarism absolutely

so times isn many because you re an expert whyclif weren you just whining about comparing the hanging of this innocent young girl is tragedy that overshadows any of the other horrible horrible things that we just tune out on daily basis mutilation is still practiced on babies in the united states its called circumsicion there is no medical justification for it would you cut your ears off so your head was easier to wash there are and speak from direct experience undereducated americans in colleges in the midwest that still believe giving birth to retarded or crippled child is god punishing the parent for sin in and how civilized do you think we would be in this country if the power and running water went out for longer then days our enlightment in our civilization is false it be space age to stone age in week we ve just got better shade of lipstick to go with our chicken

if the year plus heavy taxes gets you free healthcare and education for yourself and your family ll take it gladly over year without either of those benefits the nordic welfare states may not manage to give their citizens quite as good socialized healthcare as the wealthiest americans can buy for hard cash but they do give all of their citizens health care americans who aren stinking filthy rich get to put up with whatever the hmos feel like granting them and americans who are just plain poor or who are already sick with chronic illnesses and not stinking filthy rich just don don get health care at all extremely wealthy canadians come south to get medical care in the us but the vast majority of canadians who aren wealthy still get socialized medicine that vastly better than what their equally non wealthy peers in the usa can even hope for in the usa if you want your kids to be well educated you better live near good school which means in an expensive area and be willing to pay for private schooling in that good school which isn free either if you re poor in this country your kids will be raised ignorant unless you can afford to homeschool them which you can if you re poor in this country in sweden you send your kids to public school and they come back home actually knowing stuff at no extra cost to you most of all in most of europe and in all of the nordic welfare states the cops are good guys who actually help you in the usa unless you re rich famous and or politically connected it toss up whether they ll help you or hurt you worse po folk here are viewed as subhuman scum by the police about as often as not oh yeah the welfare states manage to provide all of the above and more annual vacation and sometimes shorter workweek too ll take the year if it comes with such benefits thank you edit speling fix

unfortunately languages that are extremely flexible at the syntax level encourage code with an extremely steep learning curve to change it this could apply to someone who not familiar with the code or even yourself year from now when you ve forgotten half the clever tricks you used with python can be rather sure that can just pick up anyone code need be able to understand it immediately and drop it in with my code almost as is all this isn to say that python isn very flexible its one of the most powerful languages out there its just that the have one and only one right way to do it design lets me put my programming ego at ease and get stuff done ve used number of languages over the years but at last my desire to spend all my time learning every language under the sun has been satisfied the languages use have been striped down to just bash asm java jython just for applets python each best suits problem area now refusing to get distracted with the amazingness of every new language feature out there and instead am getting back to developing solutions to problems this isn to say that languages such as lisp dont have great appeal but will go so far to say that major factor in the very academic oriented languages scheme hascal being used to create some of the greatest programs out there is that they simply attract the great minds now if your talking about writing dsl for circumstances were it provides clear advantage over existing languages then thats fine using metaprogramming to simplify your api for example is fine too but spending all of your time focusing on programming your programming language instead using the language to solve the problem at hand will only get you so far so languages can be tools they can be toys python is among the few that excels at both just know when your criticizing or advocating some language that when it comes time to get work done you may have to put down the toys

gt in the us most of us are aware of hateful exclusionary or bigoted words actions by select christians jews muslims etc what do you think many of the statements made in this thread were some were hateful exclusionary and bigoted against christians muslims do not act like it is religious problem only if atheists ever became majority in america the tune would be no different only the notes that composed it its just how people are whether christian muslim jew wiccan or atheist what it gets down to though which people continue to ignore is if person says that they belong to certain religion yet do not truly follow that religion then they aren really what they call themself christ taught to love others if someone who calls themselves christian lives life of hatred and they embrace that hatred then they aren truly following christianity are they this attitude that continually see which is along the lines of not religious because religion is stupid enlightened and those who follow religion are fool is just ridiculous there have been some brilliant religious people who never would have done what they did if it were not for their faith in god and there are some people who live very simple lives due to their faith of god and even ignorance and in some ways there is beauty in simple life like that envy those people sorry for rambling just sick of statements like this gt all of this comes from simple fact reddit readers are smart we hold the values of smart people this pushes us leftwards and away from god obviously this is sweeping statement and is subject to host of caveats and qualifiers like for the most part and in general but you get the gyst that so ridiculously egotistical it isn even funny

probably half or more of what have submitted to reddit has been essays that myself have written just really started my website few months ago and have reasonably small readership see nothing wrong with posting one own writings if the writings are good then mod them up if they are bad then mod them down but just because the author is trying to get more readers doesn mean they should be automatically frowned upon in fact would like to see more of what reddit users have written it seems to me that sites like this are largely aggregates of technology news why not have more contributions of original writing from users
fewer lines of code is great but computers can handle million line program just as easily as liner the real questions are is lisp really faster to code in is the coding actually easier to do is the resulting code more understandable these are what the article should be trying to prove
gt seriously folks defy any of you to tell me with gt straight face that reddit readership doesn have some gt dangerous biases notice that most of the comments in question are part of single thread initiated by one comment have you seen the article on homelessness http reddit com goto id bp would suggest that like the homeless problem police brutality problem and auto pollution problem discussed in this article the factors you are referring to have power law distribution not normal distribution not that believe being liberal or atheist is problem because am both of those things but don yet see any reason to believe that the majority of redditors are as well actually judging by the links that tend to make it to the hot and top page say there is more of libertarian slant than liberal slant which is pretty much what expect from geek hacker oriented site

basically the article argues that you think of more ideas individually than you do in group but that it more painful experience this of course assumes that you re equally likely to actually try to brainstorm using the more painful method group brainstorming by making the processing more inviting and less painful may or may not overcome its lower efficiency and this article doesn discuss the effects of small scale collobaration between two or three people

whenever you have the death penalty you will occasionally be executing innocent people because no justice system can be perfect if you choose that trade off it means that you are in very weak position to criticise other countries if you want to say that there is no way that the iranian death penalty is comparable with the us you find yourself in the contorted position of comparing the execution of teenage girls to the execution of the handicapped the fact that the us might win that particular pissing contest with iran by margin is no badge of honour
reasoned arguments not the histrionics of other posters yes wyclif im looking at you

know how about double logrithmic relation between rankings and article score in the negitive direction it could drop very slowly at first and then more quickly as the demotions pile up this would allow more people to weigh in other than just the eager guys spending all their time demoting in the new section in the positive direction the rank could move very quickly at first and then slow perhapse before becoming linear again around all the while only integer scores would be shown anyone think this would help

go sweden go the problem with nuclear energy is the only countries allowed nuclear facilities to generate power are the ones with nuclear weapons no one else is allowed into the nuclear club hence the situation is ripe for monopoly so go sweden go go iceland go is there some way to open source research or information or whatever can be open source in this
don my boss or someone else interrupts me every minutes and that when not checking reddit

you support religious freedom but you re glad that you preceive christianity to be drying up in the uk how do these points conflict you re glad to see new mosques constructed but only because you believe young muslims are more likely to reject their parents faith this was not implied by what said and don see the sense in it don really care if the world is areligious or not but think that maybe people would be better off if it was the important point is that people and societies need to develop for themselves this article is not constructive and therfore simply saying that western christian morals are superior to islamic morals
gt how is communism religion it political movement and philosophy it has no god and rejects the supernatural think it fair to say that lenin was portrayed as super human with some kind of mystical direct link to higher power the higher power was the communist destiny itself as the soviet party and state were supposed to be working from transitional period towards the mythical plane of communism it why you often see lenin pictured with children pointing towards the future where communism had finally been achieved

when it comes down to it the language is irrelevent guess comparing programming languages is perhaps slightly more relevant than comparing say english to spanish however if the language is currently being still developed chances are if feature of language is getting increasingly popular they will decide to implement it in language or someone will produce hack that does essentially the same thing the rest is quite literally simple semantics since the end result can be acheived with any language it the same argument with ruby sure it cool and may work better in some situations but are few cool features worth learning another language for me the answer is no but of course some always answer yes and if they can popularize another web dev language good for them have fun with it

ve said it before and ll say it again if the cartoons in question depicted the pope sodomizing little children would freedom of speech even be an issue of course not no self respecting newspaper in america would touch them despite the substantial evidence that the vatican condoned massive child abuse within its ranks this is freedom of speech issue for one simple reason it acceptable in the west to denigrate islam in any vicious way that springs to mind for shame as side note non believer in any religion
what can you say woz is hacker jobs isn he just pure charisma
did you give it enough time needed to get the msvcp dll and put that in the install dir after launching it with that got blank entry in my taskbar as well decided to read abit on the site from which downloaded the dll and when switched back to my taskbar to kill the process it was properly loaded

this is bad analogy paper wouldn print cartoon of child sodomy period whether the pope was doing it or not however papers print cartoon critical of religion all the time and good for them how much violence hate and lasting ill will has been caused by religion here

did not introduce the concept of moral equivalence obviously you are running into problems as soon as you start measuring ethics this sounds so trivial but nevertheless it doesn seem to be the consensus besides that the answer to your question is emotional escalation which makes it all even worse leave it up to your imagination to figure out where that could lead to hint bomb the bastards finally my assertion was related to the caricature issue and not to the innocent girl case

from their site the same love for god and neighbor that compels us to preach salvation through jesus christ protect the unborn preserve the family and the sanctity of marriage and take the whole gospel to hurting world also compels us to recognize that human induced climate change is serious christian issue requiring action now to make clear our views and commitment as evangelical leaders we have issued the statement climate change an evangelical call to action we invite you to read and reflect upon it and share your views with us we also encourage you to take action today to address climate change we believe the problem is serious but that cost effective solutions are available that will also create jobs clean up our environment make us more efficient and reduce our dependence on foreign oil thereby enhancing our national security working together and with god help we can make difference

this article is misinformed in so many ways it not even funny this is just the sitting government trying to earn brownie points for the election the coming fall there is no realistic plan to wean sweden ftrom dependency on oil virtually all cars run on gasoline and car population in sweden is old and changes slowly changing to cars capable on running on anything other than gasoline will take long time taxes on gasoline and electricity are very high but that mostly hits consumers steel mills for example buy electricity with much lower taxes and they consume lot of it the closing of nuclear power plants has caused sweden to import electricity from denmark and germany during the winter and that electricity comes from power plants powered by coal not exactly environment firendly eh and in the rural areas lots of people use boilers fueled by oil to heat their houses during the winter of course the main supply of energy in sweden comes from water turbines so we ve had to dam up many previously beatiful rivers to become so environment friendly my kudos to the the people at the governments press office though press relase that was basically ignored in swedish media seems to have been printed verbatim in the guardian

think there is misunderstood concept of freedom of speech here freedom of speech does not mean anyone can say or do what they please when they please the new york times is business and it reporters are employees freedom of speech means they can start their own paper if they want not that the new york times is under any obligation to publish those cartoons freedom of speech means that the government or another entity that that has coersive power cannot keep you from expressing just because you can do something doesn mean you should

saw joel speak in person for the first time was at last night nyc tech meetup even though ve enjoyed some of his past articles was less than impressed with his presentation he started well with an insightful satire of web vs but he went too far in mocking the two speakers who preceeded him they both demo ed job search sites and he said something sarcastic about lemmings in tech all doing the same thing these days job sites he takes that same mocking tone too far in his ajax calendars article also he assumes perhaps incorrectly that all these startups are just hoping for buyout by yahoo but can help but wonder whether or not that his sarcasm is tinged by the realization that such scenario does not exist for him in other words how likely is it that yahoo google ms et al would want to buy fog creek and make joel truly wealthy it unlikely and think he knows that which causes him to come across like curmudgeon

think it is reasonable to say the following if some mystical force modified the human race to cause us not to be religious at all the changes that force would have to make in order to remove religion would be net benefit clearly just forcing people not to be religious would not have any positive effect that why phrase my statement in that way

also elvish but really this article is eerily accurate and written by woman thought was alone
don think suggested that atheists were incapable of bigotry etc you re right it is human problem was mostly trying to highlight that personally am unfamiliar with similar anecdotes involving buddhists does your knee hurt when you jerk it like that additionally would prefer you not lump all atheists together just as you probably prefer not to be lumped with all theists some myself included are agnostic atheists being agnostic means recognizing that the whole issue is not decidable in essence in my opinion belief and non belief are on equal footing or lack of footing in the grandest scheme however must admit that occasional verifiably false claims by religious folks the earth is only years old cause me to snicker little forgive me won you and feel that the error must be rooted in deeper inability to see the true nature of things appreciate your comment that acting like christian is central to being christian though believe there are alternative views within christian circles dislike hypocrisy certainly but just because you like to disown the members of your group that do evil doesn mean that those acts were not performed in the name of god doctrine leader scripture with whom your group is associated finally agree that the last passage you quote is arrogant and is think also silly that guy needs to get bunch of smart people in room and ask them to write out coherent statement of their collective values when the dust settles like to know whether he still believes his own words
take your point about the analogy but think you re using it to miss the point the cartoons are hate speech published with the intention of demonizing muslims in general and arabs in particular what worse both are soft target in europe and america this kind of free speech is rarely used against those who can make the speaker suffer for it hence western media that rarely questions its masters

freedom of speech means they can start their own paper if they want not that the new york times is under any obligation to publish those cartoons don think the staff who quit their job would disagree with you nitpick the paper in question is ny press and not the ny times the article pretty clearly states that they believed it would be nakedly hypocritical of them to back down from publishing the cartoons due to publisher pressure after they had criticized other papers for similar behavior it hard to disagree with that line of reasoning regardless of your stance on the cartoons
btw wtf does amp stand for
think there is some weird confusion going on with this papers should have no problem running the offensive cartoons in an article about the offensive cartoons especially if they are talking about the violence however do not blame papers for not just publishing them outright they are offensive to large group of people and no it doesn take away their right to publish them but papers don regularly print offensive cartoons in general think the author screwed his own point over by saying gt not especially offensive because the issue here isn how offensive they are its about freedom of speech support papers running the cartoons when discussing the issue just as would support them showing other hateful speech in discussions about hateful speech don think it bad that they don run them on their own thats like condemning paper for not running pro kkk cartoon or jesus pissing on cross it would be their choice not to offend large amount of people

to believe this implies belief that these countries have abnormally large numbers of evil people in them in particular far more evil people than other countries and far more evil people than in other ages personally don believe this for one minute it seems far more reasonable to me that these people were just caught up with the current dogma of the day and wound up by charismatic people scapegoating certain groups in society it doesn require religion in the strict sense of belief in god to do this in fact nazism was afaik grounded in social darwinism if you read some of the literature to do with the holocaust you may come to realise that it doesn require religion for otherwise good people to do evil things
don blame capitalism for this the us government for example has prevented the creation of new oil refineries as well as distorting increasing incentives to drive by creating public roads that people don pay for directly nuclear power is virtually regulated out of existence because the government gives power to environmental lobbyists government granted power monopolies abound in this country strangling competition we have an insanely messed up energy market because of our government actions and as usual people blame the free market in your world we ll all worship at the church of the state praying for the government to solve the problems it created last week the state does not benefit from solving problems it benefits from pretending that it could solve them if only we give it more power when was the last time you heard of the government actually creating lasting solution to problem crime education poverty this is why mobocracy doesn work we are short sighted creatures when we vote we look only at immediate consequences and not the hidden results of our policies

well strictly speaking they were breaking the law at least in most states it is illegal to use the left lane except when actively passing another vehicle but agree it intriguing there aren many laws that are as commonly flouted as speed limits with the possible exception of prohibition era alcohol consumption my guess would be that it has to do with small group of committed citizens prohibiting something that was previously widely enjoyed and considered mostly harmless aside from the lawlessness think the anger arises because the way they were driving is basically bad manners and that sort of breaching of the social contract pretty much by definition makes people angry

fuel consumption rises more or less with the square of speed once you get above mph so you roughly double your fuel consumption if you drive instead of and as rule of thumb you can safely follow another vehicle closely enough to save fuel whiz bang electronics or cooperating leader notwithstanding nascar drivers have the benefit of closed course and they still crash lot

gt if you want to say that there is no way that the iranian death penalty is comparable with the us you find yourself in the contorted position of comparing the execution of teenage girls to the execution of the handicapped the iranian court took deliberate and dehumanizing position that girls must be punished for defending themselves against rapists in line with bigoted worldview imagine they do it again in the same circumstances executing the handicapped may not sound very nice but you can phrase it in such way that most people would approve executing someone guilty of heinous crime who just happens to be handicapped either way don think it the fact that the criminal is handicapped that you re objecting to it the idea that handicapped people are more likely to be innocent hence wrongfully convicted pointed question what is the implication for other protected classes like women or blacks if that is your argument it misguided we might execute people wrongfully in america but we never try to when it happens people are appalled and it ludicrous to suggest that americans who support the execution of disabled people also support the execution of disabled innocents now that the supreme court has handed down its decision mentally handicapped convicts will be imprisoned instead of executed and few will still turn out to be innocent in your formulation no justice system can be perfect american convicts can still hope for exculpation or maybe new trial the iranian system presumes women are guilty and allows now reprieve

helter don read the article as negatively or as biased it does in fact point out that the arab world during long period of the middle ages was at the forefront of culture and science in the world the numerals we use today all over the world are testament to that it more on historical scale like saying rome used to be the center of the world and during the middle ages fell into poverty and obscurity until the renaissance it also points to the dysfunctional colonial rule rs however the focus of the article is not so much on the historical development and reasons but rather on the current status and the importance and urgency for improvement in important sectors of society the original study was conducted by group of pan arab scientist for the un so while the economist has given it its treatment at least some of the numbers stand as undeniable facts irrespective of cultural biases or prejudices am very sympathetic to the fact that universally no human being or group of human beings enjoys being ridiculed and humiliated but think that it is really important that people in the arab world start building collective feeling of self worth and pride that is based in something other than dogmatic and frankly medieval interpretation of religion this sort of change can only happen if moderate voices from within the arab world can gain more influence am hoping that muslims in the west can help translate and mediate between two cultures that need to and can get along european integration policy has serious shortcomings in many regards and treating those muslims who actually know both cultures and mindsets as second class citizens strikes me as not very nice and really bad policy for long term stability and peace

gt the cartoons are hate speech think this is the crux of everybody disagreement the source and intent changes the meaning lot if these were published in neo nazi magazine then they were obviously meant to incite hatred if they were published in secular humanist magazine they would merely be critical and getting back on topic if they were republished in newspaper while discussing the controversy they re merely informative not even at the level of critical certainly not close to hateful the public deserves to know what being discussed and what at stake the cartoons have risen to the level of an important international event so people should know what going on won debate your assertion of the cartoons being hateful because don know what to make of them myself and can sort of see both sides but think we can both agree that it doesn matter in this case even mein kampf should be available to be viewed no

gt the iranian court took deliberate and dehumanizing position that girls must be punished for defending themselves against rapists in line with bigoted worldview no they didn not in the articles read the iranian court did not find the girl guilty of defending herself as you say but of murder and they didn find her mitigating defence convincing sounds like they were wrong we also have had many miscarriages of justice in the west and that usually without having the courts run by old men on some kind of religious principles gt you can phrase it in such way that most people would approve executing someone guilty of heinous crime who just happens to be handicapped but you are assuming that the handicapped are guilty you can know this and there are plenty of examples of convictions later found to be unsafe am not saying that they are likely to be innocent because they are handicapped as you suggest not aware of any causal link or statistical correlation between disability and crime gt and it ludicrous to suggest that americans who support the execution of disabled people also support the execution of disabled innocents well either they do and consider it price worth paying or they are under the false impression that the justice system is infallible
assuming that you re living in the us what wrong with taking lessons learned elsewhere and applying them to ourselves in fact isn that one of the reasons to learn things at all we should take more from the article than pity for the arab world that said johnmudd was unnecessarily trollish

didn oppose so much the article as the comments that the people posted in relation to it think the article could be written in fairer way or at least clearer but anyway it didn disturb me so much however many in this forum seem to equate islam and fundamentalist and that like if we equate germans and nazis or jews and zionists
the crusades were also what years ago it doesn diminish their position as an embarassing black mark in the history of the church but the lack of recent evidence suggests that perhaps mainstream christianity has changed since then unlike those discussed in the story or perhaps the crusades serve primarily as caution caution about what happens when religion and politics get too mixed up with one another
if you ll forgive me borrowing an analogy ve heard elsewhere appending theory after every instance of big bang is like always putting ancient set of myths after christianity note that common definition of myth is not false story but rather traditional story that has been passed down through generations which christianity certainly is however to the general population myth means falsehood just as theory means weakly supported hypothesis words and meanings are highly contextual and deutsch meddling was clearly meant to spread undeserved uncertainty and doubt by wedging in between the two meanings of theory that sneaky and deceitful much like like lying on your resume science isn creating dogma it founded on one observation and reasoning trump ideology and preconceived notions that dogma has worked out pretty well so far for some reason political hacks don seem to like it though

don get it why does everything have to be the fault of the united states mean isn it possible to consider that somebody somewhere actually did something bad and it was their fault instead of the united states at what point do people actually have to take responsibility for themselves and as for you if you re from the united states why do you have such guilt just because you happened to be born richer than most people you have to be guilty why do you have to think that everybody else in the world is innocent and that all evil that they do is somehow the fault of your country see this attitude all the time just don understand it
what makes an article hot is that reddit users vote for it not it age that the point of reddit you know
you know at some point people and countries actually have to take responsibility for themselves the united states was once colony as well oh and stop hating yourself and your country so much its counter productive have some faith

excuse me if that was rhetorical question ignore this post if you were ve studied this phenomenon bit ve noticed that dissidents get this question lot and have tried to explain it let take chomsky as an example as he among the most famous dissidents maybe near as well known as michael moore when asked why he keeps blaming america he explains that as citizen in an unusually free nation where its citizens have fought their leaders for the rights to free speech he feels moral responsibility to speak out when he perceives the press hasn done its job and when the nation leadership is committing horrendous acts in dictatorship he be largely absolved of blame in his mind however us citizens are somewhere between dictatorship and actual democracy therefore according to his moral calculus he shoulders some portion of the blame for the us actions another part of his calculus is that as fellow traveller with anarchists he believes that authority has the responsibility to regularly justify itself so in his worldview the burden of proof is on those powerful enough to invade multiple nations and large scale international violence is among the most serious burden of proofs one can imagine another thing he claims is that we like to talk about the bad things others do however he thinks we don like looking in the mirror and focussing fraction of that scrutiny on ourselves so he claims that indeed hussein and the soviets were terrible there were apparently even bans on linguistics in the soviet union because they didn like him but our main responsibility is to take care of what we can actually affect just as we expect arabs to fix their own problems he thinks we should do the same now that just one guy who many claim is an apologist for non americans other dissidents have different motivations but we have to start somewhere so we can actually scrutinize dissident thinking for flaws
correct me if wrong but don think the us colonized any arab country think britian controled places like egypt and palistine

then you are mistaken why do we know so much about ancient greece because the th century muslims translated their books socrates is regarded as the father of western thought his pupil was plato who in turn taught aristotle pretty much everything we know about their teachings comes from arabic translations including every single one of plato books the arabs not only copied them but also added extensive commentaries the muslims quite literally preserved our culture for us during the dark ages in europe

seems you didn display particularly good reading skills yourself the article said that nearly of all illiterate people were women not that of all women were illiterate so quick calculation gives figure of about illiteracy among women compared to about among men which is of course still quite horrible and indicative of the low status of women in the shitty macho and honor based culture of islamic states
oh the irony from the article even though women literacy rates have trebled in the past years one in every two arab women still can neither read nor write careful to read something before you criticize someone for not reading it

wow he using nasa worldwind http worldwind arc nasa gov
whoops that doesn add up though as the article also said adult illiteracy rates have declined but are still very high adults are illiterate almost two thirds of them women which used as the basis for my calculation if the complete region contains people as is mentioned near the top assume very close approximation would be that there are women of is about is approximately of so it seems the article has an error edit oh wait one must of course subtract children under certain age from the total before measuring illiteracy for nations with such large part of the population being very young due to extremely high rates of child birth that would make big dent in the starting figure of so an illiteracy rate near of adult females doesn seem unlikely sorry about that and my pardons to the thread starter for my rudeness

ok here are some answers mirror mirror reflects what hits it where it hits it so your feet are hitting the bottom of the mirror but your left side is hitting the right side of the mirror not sure why though sprinkler problem thinking its the opposite direction but it seems like no one knows for sure here some discussion http groups google com group sci physics browse_thread thread ebf train help really want to know the searches did nothing
is this for real read the article and it says the authorities don know who set fire to the muslim shops but still
warning spoiler ahead the mirror works not by reversing left and right but by reversing front and back inverting any single direction will change the handedness of the inverted object so if look in the mirror you see person who is left handed train is kept on its tracks by the fact that its wheels are conic sections not cylinders if the train started to go bit too much to the right it would be on wider section of the right wheels and narrow section of the left wheels this would mean that the left wheels rotating at the same speed as the right would cover less horizontal distance than the right making the train turn left not absolutely sure about this one the sprinkler does not turn at all it just sorta vibrates around the reason is that when it shoots the water out the water all goes out in one direction when it is sucking in the water is sucked in from all directions so the net momentum is not as great don have the time or the physics chops for the last one

don know the answer to the sprinkler question but here are some of the forces involved when you re forcing water out the sprinkler turns because the water exerts force on the curves of the which produces torque when you re pulling water in the water exerts the same force on the curves which will cause the sprinkler to turn the same way it did before however since you re in the water you also have to deal with issues of pressure the water entering the sprinkler will create low pressure area near the entrance don know which will dominate

the article leaves out the real reason coke uses high fructose corn syrup in the usa because the corn industry such as archer daniels midland lobbies for steep tarriffs on imported cane sugar which raises the price of cane sugar in the us by over compared to world sugar prices raising it just enough so that corn syrup is marginally cheaper in free market corn syrup would be about twice the price of cane sugar in addition to the health problems caused by corn syrup this hurts poor carribean cane farmers who lose access to huge market and the reason you haven heard about this huge donations from adm to npr
should add that soft drinks are usually made with sugar outside the us and if you ve ever tasted them side by side there no question that the sugar tastes much better and doesn have the metallic aftertaste of corn syrup

or assembler seriously some languages are just plain better than others in terms of development time assembler is better than machine language fortran is better than assembler and java are better than assembler ruby and python are better than and java and scheme lisp are generally better than ruby python say generally because the lisp family needs improvements in its libraries so that it would be better at certain tasks for example think in many cases ruby and python would beat out lisp for web development though this will likely change soon in short those languages that work at higher level of abstraction are quicker to develop in though they may execute less efficiently than the lower level ones but developer time is much more expensive than fast hardware these days so abstraction wins out

unfortunately the interpretation of the report leads me to believe that what it did was hold the goals of the west up and see how well the region meets it of course they don have democracy it antithesis to current or historical islam of course women aren treated as equals it part of the function of women having separate roles in islam however it foolhardy to believe that innovation is only possible in democracy look at the ussr and china perhaps democracy is optimal certainly rather live in democratic state than theocratic one certainly rather live in capitalist society than planned economy however it seems silly to blame the problems of the arab world on this alone likewise the idea of blaming colonialism is silly in sub saharan afric it makes more sense the continent was sliced up in such illogical ways and was decimated for four centuries their woes are the culmination of four centuries of tragedy however most of the arab world had rather short stay of colonialism so they lost little land to israel they ve had more than enough money to cure the woes that such offenses brought frankly it seems like the religion itself is to blame those who could improve the situation the innovators inventors and iconoclasts don want to live under such restrictive rules what would happen if we ignored the work of all atheists in the west what if we drove them out like germany did einstein and many in the jewish brain trust that stayed in america after world war what if we imprisoned and murdered homosexuals like turing
yes indeed am from australia where we have major sugar industry so everything uses cane sugar and it does taste much better the corn syrup soft drinks overseas give me the shakes and taste kind of metallic very unpleasant feel sorry for you no am going have nice sugar coke mmm ahhh
the cane sugar ones aren as sweet but thats fine with me the sugar used has lower gylcaemic index also think the myth of excessive sugar consumption causing diabetes was debunked some time ago the other side effects are bad enough of course if you are developing adult onset diabetes high bursts of sugar will not help the first time you show symptoms but that is not the cause

don look at it in terms of left and right lefties and righties just want the government to take freedom away in different areas some people who call themselves anarchists simply don respect the rights of others and are just jerks but most just want to be left alone and are some of the most tolerant people you ll ever meet same with libertarians many libertarians are miniarchists meaning they think the government should be restricted to performing minimal functions of which everyone has their own preferences an anarchist meaning that object to anyone having coercive power over anyone else every function that the government performs can be done voluntarily either by cooperatives or private companies competing for customers in that sense libertarians believe that initiation of coercive force is right in certain situations while anarchists believe initiation of force is never right libertarians and anarchists are also individualist as opposed to collectivist meaning that they don believe being in certain group of people entitlies one to anything nor does it deny one any rights

ve discovered that seeing how libertarianism works and government doesn requires looking at long term widespread and non obvious effects of policies for example how reducing business regulation increases wages because employers know that it is easy for their employees to quit and start their own businesses employers have to pay more to keep them most people don realize this unless they have good mental model of how society works so please don sling such judgments around lightly jugdementalist

what you describe is definitely problem however if history is any lesson freedom tends to prevent wars the more people have the opportunity to better their situations through work and trade the less they feel forced to fight or steal from others the only way to stop the state from reincarnating is through non coercive that is defensive force here an armed citizenry is must if people start trying to band together and boss you around don listen if they attack you shoot them once people see the benefits of freedom hopefully it will be hard to take it away the worst case is that totalitarian government will overpower all those fighting for their freedom but would argue that it much easier for cancerous government to simply grow until it becomes nightmare like in nazi germany the more freedom there is the more obvious threats to freedom are

this article isn libertarian in its tone the basic points are the government shouldn give tax dollars to rich people or large corporations the governmnet shouldn help people to do stupid things like build houses in flood zone libertarian would argue that the government shouldn redistribute wealth at all no food stamps social programs etc the author was very specific about what he thought needs to stop

while pointing out the foodstuffs left to the free market were not and would not be in short supply stossel left out relevant political point food production on the massive national sustenance level is national security issue if developed nation with solid technology went completely free market it would likely preserve the ability to be self sustaining for some time due to competitive technological advantage but as the technology got cheaper and the developed nation land and manpower more expensive more and more would be sent outside its borders most likely the biggest worry would be high tariffs on particular foodstuff or two when country wasn getting along with country but can almost hear the senator from the great state of your farm subsidy happy state here railing on against the perils of letting other countries hold the food supply hostage

don forget to look at the other side of the picture by the time our food supply is outsourced enough that the prospect of losing it has become quite serious the countries we buy the food from will have become so dependent on the input of american dollars that the prospect of losing that would have become quite serious after all they must be doing something with those dollars they receive and finding way to do that something in different way might not be easy every american dollar sent overseas must eventually be sent back to buy something in america
think this doomsday view is incorrect the article provides the counter example but farmers who grow beans pears and apples receive no government subsidies and they thrive free markets are best at producing ample supplies of everything american or any bunch of free people when faced with competition get innovative they find alternative ways of farming that produce greater harvests allowing them to compete with countries whose only quality is cheaper workforce guess what everyone wins we all get cheaper and more abundant or higher quality food

you need to give clear definition of power then propose we define power as the ability to use force or threat of force to cause someone to do what they don want to if did my work because was afraid of being fined going to jail or being shot then my boss would have power over me what you are describing is influence agree that my boss has influence over me but that only because allow him too it might be inconvenient to quit but if decided that my boss was trying to abuse me and be better off quitting have that option if he tried to use force to keep me working could defend myself whereas if someone uses legitimized power to do bad things you re pretty much screwed try defending yourself from an omnipresent powerful state from my point of view the idea that any government is either morally right or beneficial is naive wondering about your last statement that any power structure can be used for bad why is democracy any different what is there to stop democracy from doing something stupid like electing hitler or hamas think about it how much money is there to be made in libertarian society as the private security company that successfully defended its customers against the rise of fascism once there are several competing security companies no single one can take over and without restrictions on the market collusion is impossible since nothing is stopping all the young upstarts from starting their own private defense firms the rise of the conglomerate corporation is direct result of the ever growing power of government which small companies are much less able to defend against and use to their unfair advantage getting subsidies for example

the article raises concerns that single speed bluray drive will be too slow but no one has even announced single speed bluray drive most of them are so far since there aren even singel speed drives available it seems unlikely sony would use them when it comes to costs large part of the investment has already been made fabs and developing the cell processor together with ibm and toshiba sony makes tons of money off the playstation and microsft loses billions on the xbox to assume sony would can it bestseller seems little weird especially since both companies think their consoles are the key to gain dominance in the livingroom

don think this is an attack on google as such what the eff wants is change in the law to give personal data on remote servers the same protection as data stored on your own pc software is going this way and the law needs to catch up google new desktop search is just an extreme example that makes good target for publicising the issue

say that replacing user rating from reddit with behavior algorithms will get you something that hasn been done yet but that similar to technorati this new reddit would roam or get pings from just the blogosphere gathering all the recent outbound links and parsing them as votes la pagerank it would then algorithmically cluster these links into broad flavors technology politics nsfw etc and update these lists as frequently as it is technically feasible what this new reddit would answer is great thing the blogosphere has just found out not great talk the blogosphere has just spurted_ as technorati does nor is great in the web according to the web as google does mighty cool website that would be methinks elzr http elzr com

from the article the privacy problem arises because the electronic communication privacy act of or ecpa gives only limited privacy protection to emails and other files that are stored with online service providers much less privacy than the legal protections for the same information when it on your computer at home it not really in the service provider hands to offer greater protection if the law says they have to hand over your data then they ll have to do so

beg to differ any number of companies have absolutely inane hiring policies and the more people read about the way joel hires the more hopefully get it through their head that just because they ve got tons of cash are looking to sell the joint to the highest bidder they shouldn throw job offer at everyone who walks in the door
also tend to think joel pretty good on occasion but this doesn even have much to say except here how our internship hiring is going kinda neat to read about but nothing terribly insightful there it seems like people just submit the latest jos blog entries to reddit every time it updated
thanks for trying but none of those are what was thinking of my point was not very important simply that bush believes in more than just cronyism he has his religious beliefs his beliefs regarding government function etc think that these beliefs guide his decisions including hiring as much as cronyism

how do you rate privacy stories if you routinly demote google stories but promote privacy eff stories you ll probably see this
so your main critique of anarchy is that it isn practical that the state will inevitably return can deal with that courts can easily be provided privately if were to start private court take great pains to provide the fairest judgement possible in the interest of getting more clients in any case the person ultimately responsible for enforcing property rights is the victim or the victim friends and family if someone steals from you you hire people to catch them once they re caught they have two choices pick court that you find acceptible or go to jail you might ask what is to prevent you from falsely accusing someone and only accepting courts that always rule in the victim favor well if it became evident that you were doing so the accused could accuse you of initiating aggression in the form of fraud and charge you right back and if you were convicted you be paying all the court costs in the end any kind of fraud just results in big waste of time and money for the perpetrator when courts are private and competing everyone has chance of getting their case heard and it prevents people from trying to manipulate the courts as well as keeping costs down not to mention that our current system doesn work so well if you try to sue the government don fall for the common fallacy that just because we need courts we need monopolistic provider of courts that like saying that since food is necessary the government must provide food or that only the government should have guns you do have good point can guarantee that some group of people won slowly and secretly build up an army and try to take over but rather take my chances starting from anarchy then constantly worrying that my own government is going to go kim jong il on me some day think however that as people become more attuned to the danger of the state it will become harder and harder to convince us that the state is even necessary mean we re arguing now about whether government is inevitable rather than whether it is good thing we both know that initiation of force is bad suppose anarchy can only work if the people are wise and if the growth of government is reversed peacefully until it disappears which is why having this discussion in the first place if we all sit satisfied with the government it will grow and we will be living in hell it just matter of time

can you point me to resource that explains your particular position in detail at first glance it sounds utterly ridiculous for example suppose go out and kill man let call him bob in cold blood out in the open where everyone can see but bob has no friends or family did just get away with murder and if you say that some indignant bystander will prosecute me then consider that could have been somewhat more discreet in killing bob so anyone who suspected me of it would have to work much harder you might say that in such society you had better make friends well say that if justice is about having friends and not just friends but well enough to do friends then it doesn sound like justice to me america streets are filled with the down and out and although they are often denied justice their cause would seem doubly hopeless in an anarchist state

this has been covered in the news on and off recently major drawbacks of using brain imaging as practical lie detection method are that it is expensive requires elaborate methods facilities and expert technicians requires the cooperation of the subject fmri the method described sort of in the article measures changes in blood flow and blood oxygenation in the brain it requires that the subject lie motionless nearly in nmr scanner and participate in the interview interrogation lie detection would require three types of scan structural scan regular mri to find landmarks in the particular subject brain so that activity can be mapped to functional regions baseline functional scan while the subject is being truthful or perhaps just resting an experimental interrogation scan while the subject is being questioned and may or may not be telling lies the running of these scans the design of the procedure and the data analysis are all non trivial needless to say can see police depts adopting this method anytime soon maybe the cia nsa type folks would have the resources but the subject cooperation is still big issue finally it is leap to say that subjects cannot defeat this method in the same way that polygraphs are defeated it may be harder to do but bloodflow is just one more physiological measure by adopting covert strategies one might muddle this measure the subject might recall of time that he or she was deceptive during the baseline functional scan and thereby render the difference between the baseline and the interrogation scan very small non existent nice application spin to get grant money by the researchers however

don know if this has been posted already if it was am sorry this article points out how the danish paper jyllands posten might actually have double standard when it comes to using religious symbols in their editorial cartoons the paper is making disingenuous claim to the right of freedom of speech when publishing cartoons of the prophet mohammed and then censoring offensive depictions of jesus this does not mean that the muslim mobs have right to do what they are doing but it does give some evidence to what some muslims are claiming as bigotry against muslims

newspaper might perhaps be said to censor when it suppresses information with news value for example way back in the or the washington post used coverage or not of minor riot to press the then government of dc for some reforms every newspaper though every day makes judgments about what is worth printing negative judgment does not usually amount to censorship in this case the cartoonist made one judgment on his cartoons and the editor made another muslims who feel put upon can throw down their at the local movie theaters when the da vinci code opens and revel in flick that won be pleasing pope or parsons

tend to roll my eyes when someone decides to ban windows from their office depending on what kind of people you have using computers in your office banning windows is just not good idea my mother for example can hardly use the easiest most mature features of windows such as moving file from one folder to another can imagine her trying to do anything with linux don get me wrong windows is pretty bad but viable alternatives for common users are quite rare

if you killed bob in the open someone would call the police just like today if you killed bob discreetly how would today police do better job of finding out about it the problems you describe neither condemn private police nor support government police as far as the down and out there are many high crime places where government police do not respond to calls because they are afraid and they don get paid more for better performance in free society the down and out would be able to buy guns for much cheaper and protect themselves as well as have better access to justice the poor being denied justice is symptom of our government monopoly on justice

also recommend paul graham own ansi common lisp http www amazon com gp product liked it slightly better than practical common lisp for getting the lisp way of thinking across not as much um practical code though oh and if you really want an aha experience then there paradigms of artificial intelligence programming case studies in common lisp by norvig http www amazon com gp product which both introduces common lisp and takes you all the way up through writing classical ai systems using it
which is why using this as an example of us being better than them is dumb but the article doesn do that at all

old news
practical common lisp
you make really good point suppose the main difference is that we have much better access to information today the spread of information always supports truth more than lies which is why communists fascists censor information proposed that there sort of tipping point with anarchy when enough people realize that it is the best system as long as the state does not return and the only thing that can prevent the return of the state is awareness at least until the anarchy stabilizes don think that tipping point has been reached but fighting to bring it nearer gonna have to say that you re right anarchy won work unless people realize that it the best option the early united states was well close the government was created to protect our rights but it doesn protect us from itself at least the founding fathers tried to build self regulating system which was much better than any previous government hoping that each new nation gets closer and closer to anarchy
as does yours lot of work and organization was done by lot of people in the civil rights movement but we don know their names or their accomplishments we do however remember have dreama and mlk deeply religious beliefs led him to maintain that protest and civil disobediance was the path to changing america we could ve very well had someone like rev al sharpton who used his influence to incite race riots so yes really mlk is not significant is about as absurd as saying why are you even posting on the internet the sun going to burn out in trillion years and when it goes we re all gonna be forgotten
cancer treatments can be mind numbingly expensive particularly if the prognosis was less than great family man may not have wanted to offload hundreds of thousands in debt onto his kids and wife we re also living in heavily indebted society it bad call but there are lot of people out there who simply aren able to raise quarter million dollars all that easily this is both unforgivable and unconsionable wrongfull death suit if doctor had done this it would be murder one
exactly right some people have no idea that chemotherapy can run into the tens of thousands of dollars per treatment even rather wealthy person would rapidly come up against wall trying to bank it personally further this is what health insurance companies supposedly do this is their business supporting the customer financially in the case of catastrophic medical problems if they don support clients who have such needs then their only business is fraud understand that these companies must review claims to prevent fraud or frivolous claims from dishonest doctors and clients however they reflexively reject claims too often financial losses from fraud are recoverable delayed or missed medical treatments lead to permanent loss of health and life it especially obscene when you remember that the money they refuse to dole out was given to them by people like this patient
gt gonna have to say that you re right anarchy won work unless people realize that it the best option we agree

gt gt the reality is the blame and shame game isn going to get us anywhere we are all at fault christopher said imho the blame and shame game is not going far enough those within the insurance company responsible for the denial of treatment must be brought up on charges and do time
this seems like situation where an ambitious lawyer or firm could make the case for premeditated crime the insurance company had ample medical evidence they were killing man and willingly refused treatment essentially the same thing as premeditated murder by drawn out torture
you re right the interface of mainstream image searchers is not only unintuitive but cumbersome right now there reason why they do it like that though presenting the independent photo directly not to say in the page as in this website is sure to be perceived as hotlinking by an angered many believe this is an outdated point of view with the modern commoditization of bandwith the full size image is the new thumbnail it preview of what inside your website you re in your right to block this usage to be sure but doing so will increasingly exclude yourself more and more from the conversation

work in the health care field in an area which involves payers entities which are usually insurance companies it is standard operating procedure for insurance companies to arbitrarily deny claims for virtually no reason whatsoever they do this because they know the cost of pursuing the claim is too great to be worthwhile for the doctor the proper way to fix healthcare in this country is not to focus on malpractice which is small amount by comparison the place to focus is on getting payers to cough up the amounts they are contractually obligated to pay unfortunately you can imagine who has the greater lobbying power insurance companies or doctors so don expect any significant reform any time soon

this article as sad as it is seems clearly intended to be hit piece against the insurance company it leaves out every relevant detail that might explain the company behaviour or the other options that woulda shoulda did weren tried if the company was as in the wrong as the article implies as the author would cover those issues just to make it clear leaves one wondering what left out insurance is purely contract issue things are either covered or they re not obviously some contracts are better than others and one should definitely evaluate their coverage based on lot more than just the rate another problem is that most health insurance isn insurance at all but rather is mostly pre paid discount health package best to have good health savings plan backed up by actual health insurance with very large deductible for when costs get up high these are much more affordable and fit the concept of insurance better

in general agree but doubt this problem is the result of government intrusion sounds like an insurance company that refuses to live up to its contractual obligations that is legitimate place for government intervention and yes lawsuit is the appropriate response business can function without strong legal system to enforce contracts

true but believe some critics point out the us wealth distribution http faireconomy org research wealth_charts html where the bottom owns of the wealth while the richest owns one noticeable characteristic of capitalism is that there are large number of people who gain sustenance by wages selling their labor on market in the real world it turns out that about of people are neither workers nor capitalists but third class of professionals managers that has been variously called names like the new class or the coordinator class at least since barbara ehrenreich book some claim that this third class ruled the soviet union and serves power in the us mention this as many of us are part of that fairly empowered class and that gives us different perspective than some factory worker

because of all people her life was not about politics in the least please spare me your false indignation the speakers were true to the spirit and life of coretta scott king and not single person who knew her was offended you re attempting to divert attention from the message of the speakers and of coretta scott king life itself simply because it doesn match your politics that itself is political statement on your part and it dishonors the memory of everything she stood for

you don even know me was talking about political statements as whole whether they came from the left or the right imo they don have anything to do with her statements about racial equality definitely but statements concerning whether or not wmds existed in country or not what does that have to do with her but hey turning someone funeral into place to make potshots at the president you don agree with is lame that is what dishonors everything she stood for her funeral was supposed to be place to remember her not to continue on the same rhetoric that has been stated for years now the only person with false indignation here is you not indignant about anything just think it was something that wasn very respectful gt because of all people her life was not about politics in the least just wonder what you would ve thought if president bush would ve stood up at her funeral and used it as platform to make statement or two against abortion would you still be so adamant about the issue or would you be adamant against him for doing that

exactly insurance companies get away with bad service and terms because regulation protects them from competition there should be loads of start up insurance companies challenging these guys but it lot harder to do that than it should be regulation is just about always proposed by existing companies in any given industry they claim it for consumer protection but they re really just protecting themselves

the two posts above me are absolutely correct there is zero competition in the health care insurance market and it is due to government regulations the interesting thing is that those regulations are lobbied for by the existing insurance companies as although they are cost to existing companies cost they merely pass on to the consumer they are insurmountable barriers to entry for new competitors it is axiomatic when the problem is the government the solution is not more government

totally agree congress should stay out of this there are lot of doomsday scenarios floating around about how if we don enforce network neutrality with regulation the world as we know it will end since there is clearly no problem right now and there may never be don think congress should intervene whatever legislation they come up with they will inevitably get wrong or it will be overly vague and we ll end up having judges who don understand anything about technology deciding the future of the internet furthermore even lessig admitted that most of these potential problems might be moot if there were healthy competitive isp market instead the current duopoly rather than trying to patch the situation with more regulation why don we get at the root figure out what is making it so difficult for companies to enter the market and fix that
the problem is the usa every other modern western society has state sponsored health care live in ireland and though the health system gets frequent complaints of not being efficent enough and waiting lists being to large it be political suicide for politician to suggest that it be abolished why do americans put up with it why don they demand from their government that there be state sponsored health system this is matter of life or death ffs jsut can understand it

my british aunt had blockage in an artery in her neck it was causing her to go blind for increasing amounts of time eventually up to minutes the prognosis was total permanent blindness unless she was operated on immediately the soonest the national health system could see her was in six months as result she went to private doctor and was operated on immediately and with complete success of course this meant she had paid for the operation twice once in the taxes she had paid all those years for service that failed to deliver on its promises and again when she paid the private doctor despite the troubles with the american health care system people come from all over the world including other western countries to get care they cannot receive at home via their native socialist medicine programs

what find more difficult to understand though is the restriction on speech and access to knowledge free country has nothing to fear from the truth actually it does truth sounds noble and glorious and pure but unrestricted access tom say everyone medical history and publication of the same is not good thing indeed there is similar argument made about the state eavesdropping on its citizens if you have nothing to hide then you have nothing to fear but it seems less appealing when the shoe is on the other foot the problem is not that there are restrictions in place but the type of restrictions and the motivation for them
think he said restriction on speech and access to knowledge knowledge not someone personal information
what if we do have people who commit terrible acts as part of their job while in private they remain loving husbands good parents and caring friends such as the executioners at federal prisons many people consider what they do to be reprehensible they themselves may even be inclined to think so but manage to justify it as duty or perhaps they see it as justice which expect may also be true for people who commit torture

wonder if simple keyed encryption mechanism might be adequate for example google encrypts your data with key encrypts the key with your password and stores everything but your password on their servers the password is only used to verify hash and temporarily decrypt the key the password and decrypted key are never stored persistently on the servers maybe that would be adequate to keep out the government alternatively they could leave the data totally encrypted on their servers and the index structure unencrypted but the keys and values encrypted that would make searching bit less flexible but it would mean decryption could be purely client side bit safer from hackers that way since then you can add client side mechanisms such that even the password alone is not enough to decrpyt you need private key or suchlike

well stand by what said rather have debt than be dead and know if it were my dad and choice between having him and tons of debt or no debt and no dad well that one seems pretty clear not absolving the insurance company here it absolutely idiotic if the treatment could ve saved his life but would it have the article doesn say and that what got my spidey sense tingling they never spoke specifically about his prognosis about whether the denied treatment would ve actually saved his life or at least lengthened and or improved quality of life not to mention that story like this is massive pr killer for the firm systematically denying coverage to cancer patient is great way to destroy your own business so it doesn make much sense if you want to continue to have customers that they hear you ll nickel and dime them on cancer treatment the man and the doctors all spoke as if their hands were tied my point is that if someone else seemed to give you essentially death sentence as this article suggests well wouldn you try to find way to beat the rap or would you just sit there holding lot of anger in
this one has been posted before
actually the ama does fair amount of lobbying itself take look at http www opensecrets org orgs list asp order and see who don see any insurance lobbyists above them
don think anarchy is solution to better healthcare the root problem is the greater lobbying power in free market power inevitably coalesces and you end up with monopolies as result basically pure free market where money equals power is inherently unstable and this is why we have these monopolies and cartels this is where government has positive role to be able to override this inequality of power by regulation tax breaks for startups etc and better balance the interests of everybody the reasons that most people are anti government is because government is up for sale and their interests are not well represented in comparison to say tobacco lobbyists but this is precisely symptom of weak government and an overpowerful market

first in free market power does not inevitably coalesce this is shown by the fact that in the unregulated portions of our economy companies come and go witness what happened after the airlines were deregulated dozens of airlines have come and gone including some that were considered absolutely unassailable like panam second if you are concerned about the coalescing of power the ultimate form of that is the government where the unelected bureaucracy stays decade after decade unresponsive to any but their own interests as far as lobbying power is concerned the problem is that specific interest is willing to spend lot of money in focused effort to buy key politicians while the people have their own lives they need to attend to as result the forces representing the people never get as organized or influential as those of the specific interests any government with power will use that power to represent the interests of the most powerful members of society this has been true throughout history regardless of the form of the government it has been observed that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely that is never clearer than in centralized government totally off topic but already here and writing find it interesting that some people think the liberal counter culture of the is what has led to the socialism of today the slogan of the counter culture was power to the people which is the antithesis of socialism where all power is put in the hands of the very few this is why strong government on the right is not meaningfully different than strong government on the left in both cases it is implied by necessity that the people have no power power is zero sum game the government cannot gain power without the people losing it and society where the people have no power is always totalitarian state the epitome of flower power melanie safka is libertarian http www theadvocates org celebrities melanie html anyone who opposes abuses of government power and supports personal freedom should be libertarian the government cannot abuse power it doesn have including regulating small business into non existence at the behest of large companies who handle regulation as just cost of doing business sorry for the ramble but was on roll

that is very interesting set of data and modded you up as result cannot say what is the force behind allowing insurance companies to routinely screw over doctors it remains fact though that doctors routinely lose of what they could collect to bogus claims denials this percentage is combination of cost of claims that are never collected on and the cost of filing claims repeatedly the inefficiencies on the business side of medicine are stupendous

what is more offensive to you publishing disrespectful cartoons or burning down an embassy we can talk about how inappropriate or unacceptable the cartoons were all day long but the violent reaction to them is far worse and will only cause outsiders to view all muslims as crazed fanatics who are unable to assimilate into modern societies if something is offensive to you then state your case why and how it offends you this is rational burning down buildings and the like is irrational and detrimental to your own cause
massive unemployment comes from the lack of keynesianism to pick up the labour force slack massive increase in the gdp in the top comes from the reduction in corporate taxes reduction of income taxes and so on one would hope the money would trickle down but it really trickles to the people who make most of the money in business the owners aka the people who it trickling from do you want links to studies do you have an sources you won accept would hate to take the time to post links if you re going to just say oh you can believe anything xyz says because don agree with them
was just addressing the costs that you referred to if you re going to say that the nhs has wasted money or cannot keep its end of the bargain you need to pay attention to your accounting as it happens regarding quality the nhs is way superior to private health care in some areas such as dentistry and psychiatry and equal in others however this is not widely known outside the medical profession and you will see people paying fortune for private care in the mistaken belief that they are getting the best typically they will be treated by nhs doctors in nhs facilities and their payment will simply enable them to jump the queue

think that most opponents of globalization fail to understand this simple concept dollars that go out of the usa must eventually be used to buy us products or services us jobs are created to make those products and perform those services in my opinion there are some very good reasons to limit globalization damage to the economy is not one of them increased trade and interdependence seems likely to help the economies of all involved nations as for farm subsidies for national security we have to decide on what counts as national security certainly protection from famine is included the risk of famine due to interruption of food imports is very small in my opinion if corn production slows in the midwest and war cuts corn imports the nation will just have to eat rice grown in the south fat people would have to eat healthy rice instead of corn chips cookied in corn oil if such situation occurred bet it would take very little time for the us to regain sufficient corn production the states is so big with so many natural resources that this argument applies to every imported product even oil if oil imports were cut off the nation would survive on oil from texas alaska and the gulf it wouldn take long before everything was running on propane and hydrogen recession might occur but does that count as national security situation is the health of the nation economy to be considered as part of the nation security don know

what it actually boils down to is when push came to shove nhs failed my aunt they knew what needed to be done and when it needed to be done but were willing to let her go blind for the rest of her life because she didn fit into some bureaucrat five year plan it had nothing to do with getting the best it had to do with getting emergency treatment that was otherwise unavailable it also failed my grandmother who had to spend her last days in private facility due to the atrocious care she received under the nhs too many patients not enough nurses and doctors there is very little incentive under socialist medicine for person to dedicate themselves to the years of advanced education to become doctor as result there is chronic shortage of good doctors in the nhs when all the accounting is looked at quality of patient care nhs is failure as rule people go from the uk to the us for care but they do not go from the us to the uk for care top doctors leave the uk and practice in the us but not the reverse as for british dentistry it is legendarily bad for example austin power teeth are part of the overall joke
paul graham talking about something else there are three variants of procrastination depending on what you do instead of working on something you could work on nothing something less important or something more important that last type argue is good procrastination that the sense in which the most impressive people know are all procrastinators they re type procrastinators they put off working on small stuff to work on big stuff this article is more about type type just disambiguating
am procrastinator combine this with the fact that have this unexplainable fear of talking to unknown people and strong urge to flee from uncomfortable situations keep on putting off making work related phone calls not good wonder if there is some kind of term for these things
yeah the things to know sure didn seem to include anything helpful to get us procrastinators moving in the right direction there is one exception it says procrastinators can change their behavior but doing so consumes lot of psychic energy and it doesn necessarily mean one feels transformed internally it can be done with highly structured cognitive behavioral therapy damn that doesn too fun sounds like something be likely to put off for while actually
your theory does not explain why these shootings were assembled in such video collage it does not explain the choice for the soundtrack it is not an educational video at all there is no commentary and in most cases the cars following behind in fact did not get close at all certainly not close enough to read any warnings and lastly even if cars would ve come too close they didn it is public road and by no means are contractors are allowed to shoot and kill people for doing that they were clearly not at security check point and they did not issue any warnings to the effect either
apparently your english comprehension skills aren that hot either as the link says italian
procrastinators actively look for distractions particularly ones that don take lot of commitment on their part checking mail and reddit com is almost perfect for this purpose
skeptical if you are skeptical in nature you should be doubting peak oil it is the suddenly boosted into the mainstream by just journalists spouting lots of dubious statistics without solid proof etcetera the article itself is pretty good one the only thing it fails to mention is that peak oil is so far still theory and by no means certainty but this is good in way even if you take peak oil as gospel this article explains that it won be the next teotwawki comparing peak oil to is good comparison too

think it depends on which country you are from in south africa you will rarely have cards from different banks as no one bank will give you that big an advantage over the others and they in general disapprove of you having accounts with the competition solve the problem by only carrying the absolute critical cards with me and the ones know will need on that day the rest are safely locked up at home so the most is probably credit card and medical card most of them time carry only cash and only what need since the best money management is not to have money with you when you feel that itch to buy something you don really need

agree that insurance companies are big problem but on the other hand why are medical costs so high why must doctor and lawyers be paid so lucratively is it because their impact on whether you die is so prominent what about the mechanic that services your car if he makes mistake you could die too what about the engineer that designs your shopping mall or the train you take every day traditionally governments have built corporations where private involvement doesn makes sense more applicable outside us power companies telco road infrastructure etc usually start out as state owned this usually works if government remains free and without corruption many doctor know are doctors because of the money and only that up to the point where they don want to treat patients without seeing the money first say cut these guys down to size so that only those with real passion for helping people remain do this by lowering their incomes to be similar to other skilled people this will reduce costs lot
did he even read the peak oil website he was referred to while don agree with everything on there all of his arguments since they are the first ones everybody thinks of when they hear about peak oil are already countered there still have some hope it won be big issue but this just leave it to market forces argument is bunk if when the world consumption exceeds oil production capacity and if the futures market then causes the price to spike and market forces to swing into action it already too late to economically scale up the alternative sources that just became commercially viable and their infrastructure because the price of oil just spiked and with it the price of manufacturing and construction having journalists make this scary issue that everybody is aware of like might allow the market to solve it if enough people are seeing the problem coming and do things such as banking on the spike or whatever they think is going to happen then the market can act pre emptively instead of reacting afterwards when it too late to fix mass hysteria will solve this problem even the picture he paints is still bad we ll switch to alternative energy sources because while they cost too much to switch to now oil will soon cost more goody clearly it going to be non event like then

quoted as oil gets more expensive other technologies will compete on price and replace oil there are so many new options that become available as oil prices rise that we will simply replace oil with all of these other technologies don believe that peak oil will be the end of our civilization but to say that barrel is non event is just plain wrong in my opinion fail to see the logic that says that buying alternative energy for much higher price will make peak oil non event the main problem is not that we will totally run out of energy the problem is that alternative sources of energy will come at much higher cost also the author fails to mention the main hypothesis about peak oil theory that the peak may come much sooner than we think if the production peak will come in years maybe it will be close to non event but what if as some people believes the peak has already been passed still non event

the best commentary ve read over this subject my view on the subject is freedom of expression must have no restrictions when someone crosses from some other point of view some kind of border it just matter of his personal taste and you may agree or disagree but you re not allowed to start chain reaction like the one these criminals supposed to be muslims started
my guess would be prison
that essay was condescending and sloppy and as such extremely irritating it sets up an analogy between reasoning about computation and reasoning about political life the falsehood of this analogy is so obvious that only an idiot would propose it as einstein said as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality they are not certain as far as they are certain they do not refer to reality the theory of computation is hell of lot simpler and better posed than even very basic political issues and so reasonable people can agree on the correct answer to many computational problems that is not at all true of politics even among libertarians despite the author provincial claim to the contrary he makes guess in the essay as to why libertarians are sometimes seen as arrogant perhaps the real reason he himself often comes across as arrogant is that only an arrogant fool could think he can reliably predict the effects of social policy and reason objectively about the desirability of those effects
mostly agree with the author substitutes in consumption and production will mean that we switch away from the most costly to produce and switch into those commodities that give us most benefit where disagree with the author is his notion that you can just put tax on the commodity to speed up the process while the transition may be sped up it isn really sensible to add costs to the economy for no real purpose we all suffer there is nothing inherently wrong with oil as source of energy
uh try being medical student paying at least dollars in education and that is just medical school don forget the money that one has to pay for undergraduate education to get into medical school and then there the at least years of residency where you are making around dollars year meanwhile loan companies are on your ass because you ve graduated the interest piles up that is over years in education where there really is no pay unless your family is independently wealthy would be doctors have to give up lot to become doctors
many concepts such as the one child policy are outrageous or offensive to western sensibilities but they are widely supported and well regarded here and frankly they make certain amount of sense in practical terms the west will likely end up adopting similar policies stopped reading there there no way that can take such statements seriously or with straight face while every reliable indicator tells me that the west especially europe and the are facing rapidly declining birthrates which will soon affect the ability of those countries to retain strong economic presence in science technology and host of other industries if they haven already and convinced they have is mr shuttleworth aware of how the birthrate of country like say germany affects its gnp so to hear some guy blab about the west needing population control based on visit to china strikes me as not only ironic but ridiculous
have to take exception sic with advice which says that coding standards are not important the author obviously never worked in teams where there were more than coders or where there were few people who insisted on doing things their own way to the detriment of others who voluntarily play by the rules here concrete example let say you like to indent characters per tab stop the safe way to do this is to set your editor so that tab key press never inserts the tab asc character but rather just moves over columns and inserts spaces in their place now if programmer foo comes along and configures his editor so that the tab character is interpreted as movin columns over instead of the default then the file will be unreadable to you the original editor imagine this interleaved throughout thousand line source file across hundreds of files at the end of the day why is coding standard important it so that if people have to look over the same code base they don have to waste an extraordinary amount of time trying to reformat code in their head and don get me started on the author comment about not commenting your code if you ve ever had to maintain million lines of code over year period you instantly know that overcommenting is life saver even especially if you are the sole author of those million lines
didn know suicide bombers had passengers in the rear seat huh
this essay is from honestly the character of the net has changed lot since then there was lot of libertarian discussion on the usenet at the time enough so that if you were an alien who came to earth and read only usenet you might have thought libertarians were the dominant political party do not think that is the case anymore what the author didn consider is that back in the net was very attractive to niche communities the phrase the long tail was years away from being coined but people were discovering the effects of it even back then if you were republican or democrat in there was no reason you had to get on something as crude as the internet there were communities that existed for you in real life on the other hand if you were libertarian in one of the few places libertarian community existed was the internet and the trend fed itself once you got on the internet and found someone who agreed with your political views you probably talked politics lot making others with similar views more likely to join the discussion etc there may have been seeming correlation between programmers and libertarians at the time but that only because there was almost nobody on the internet but programmers could have found correlation between almost any weird sex fetish and programmers at the time too but once again that because of the ability of the internet to cater to out of the mainstream communities and does not imply any actual causality
gt what it actually boils down to is when push came to shove nhs failed my aunt presumably she had been using the nhs all her life did she not get what she paid for then there are failures in any system however well run your anecdote is good talking point and clearly disgraceful failure of the nhs however you are extrapolating all kinds of incorrect stuff from it have relative who career was advising people who had complaints about the nhs her agency was run as completely independent entity and could only have been funded by government she will now never use private care as result of what she learnt gt they knew what needed to be done and when it needed to be done but were willing to let her go blind for the rest of her life because she didn fit into some bureaucrat five year plan waiting list is not the same as five year plan comments like this are indicative of fantasy outlook ironically the main problem in the nhs is the attempt at imposition of some kind of free market principles this has meant resources are being diverted to unneccesary layers of management on the ideologically based assumption that the nhs was innefficient from top to bottom and needed sorting out by management professionals we just had story on reddit about the huge efficiency of self organising objective based teams this had been going on in the nhs for decades gt there is very little incentive under socialist medicine for person to dedicate themselves to the years of advanced education to become doctor as result there is chronic shortage of good doctors in the nhs you don understand the uk health system all doctors are trained by the nhs the shortage is due to those doctors then going into private practise or abroad not due to lack of people becoming doctors gt top doctors leave the uk and practice in the us but not the reverse because they get paid more private healthcare way more expensive gt as rule people go from the uk to the us for care but they do not go from the us to the uk for care know personally of people travelling from the us to use nhs facilities because they were far superior less slick but much better care there are some operations and treatments which aren available in the uk which people have to travel for and these rightly get huge publicity gt as for british dentistry it is legendarily bad for example austin power teeth are part of the overall joke strange then that the private dentists are nhs trained the austin powers joke the uk is not known for dental such as straightening and whitening which is actually sign of poor dental health there was also problem with over fluoridisation in the uk water post war which led to number of people with gnarly but extremely strong teeth that never needed dentist

have to take exception sic with advice which says that coding standards are not important think his point was that anal rententive obsessing over code standards was bad close enough is often good enough to allow people to get on with productive work
right the coding standards tip was the only one that really disagreed with it not so much the added recognition load as the added recall load if there no coding standard you have to stop and remember whether that variable ought to be headercount or headercount or headercnt or chdr ve found that developing consistent naming convention and common vocabulary is perhaps the biggest factor in the success of large projects things like brace placement and indent level aren as important to me as can usually read just about any coding style in common usage and it usually fixable with menu item in the ide anyway mixing tabs amp spaces is huge pain but also fixable by the ide it really the naming conventions that can cause huge problems the author comment about comments should be read as code smell not an absolute prohibition whenever you see comment ask yourself if you could ve extracted the code into method or named your variables better if comment dictates something that should not occur use an assertion to make sure it doesn occur there are some comments that really shouldn be removed why comments are the most obvious ones and probably the ones find most helpful when navigating large codebase well placed where comment is helpful if the flow of control isn obvious but again you should ask yourself how to refactor the program so the flow of control is obvious commenting is duplication of information and like most instances of duplication one or both copies usually lies that more dangerous than not commenting at all because it can blind you to what the code is really doing

gt in free market power does not inevitably coalesce actually was recently told by an academic that there was mathematical proof of this guess need to get more info on that but say it was clearly evidenced by monopolies and cartels particularly in societies where money talks the most gt this is shown by the fact that in the unregulated portions of our economy companies come and go but do major shareholders come and go think it obvious and fundamental that the kind of volatility you are talking about can be mapped to the size of the company trends not exceptions prove the rule in this case gt witness what happened after the airlines were deregulated dozens of airlines have come and gone including some that were considered absolutely unassailable like panam the airline sector was particularly volatile and you would obviously get shifts of power following changes in the regulatory regime update us are now investigating airlines for evidence of cartels see http reddit com info id yp as for the rest of your post don want to get into libertarianism here think it no more than an expression of utter selfishness for the record but would say that your statements seem to be based on false premise that the state and its occupants are two diametrically opposed forces
think you missed the point of what he was trying to say the author was not suggesting that we switch to soybeans but that it was one of many options available one thing that the author did not mention was the consumer side of the equation as prices go up humans will curtail their consumption of the resource we see that today with people buying more fuel efficient cars the hummer is dead
awesome does anybody have any idea how this works or how someone came up with it

oh just to clarify do agree that it crap that she being punished so much for that minor incident it just the headline take issue with meek simple peaceful heck it doesn even help our side it obscures the real issue which is that the punishment is too extreme
well if one using vim they re just asking for it
but google isn in the business of making products that only appeal to idiots so think it unlikely that they will do this
the contractors clearly discriminate between approaching vehicles and cars pulling right up alongside they only fire upon the former your argument for keeping distance from potential suicide bombers falls apart right there one would expect certain envelope on all sides for relative traffic these motorists were shot at and potentially hurt or killed for virtually no reason these guys are basically living out grand theft auto in no consequence zone pointless
close up we read person face by the the finer parts of his features from afar however we must rely on more macroscopic shading these pictures think have one face finer features superimposed on blur of the other shading
the article describes her as meek so think it fair play for the headline to reflect the content also think the real issue is not that the punishment is too extreme but that she shouldn have been arrested in the first place and that her right to free speech was violated that what she is suing for in any case
good for her the world would be better place if there were more like here

have heard of many more people going from the uk to us or even to india for their health care than anyone going to the uk how is the nhs far superior myself would never leave my life in the hands of the nhs not all doctors are trained by the nhs you neglect to point out the doctors from india and pakistan who have to pass exams such as the plab the us and the uk systems are very different for instance the attitudes towards physicians are very different in the us second opinions are commonplace whereas in the uk it is very rare because the doctor is always right having socialized medicine is all fine and good when you are healthy but give it go when you develop cancer or some other pathology
evolution and faith false dichotomy
indeed
disagreement does not constitute criminal act in free country at worst she should have been allowed to wait for the shuttles in an area outside of earshot asking her to leave at an unreasonable time creating threat of criminality via trespassing laws is just thick headed behavior wouldn expect any less from the creators of free speech zones

it has to do with how your brain processes images there are two faces one normal and one with grin the left hand pic consists of blurred normal face superimposed on the angry face the right hand pic is the opposite blurred grin normal face the blurry images on each side are mainly low frequency in nature while the non blurred images consist of higher frequency components simply put you can say that the pictures are beeing low pass filtered when you step back few feet or just squinting your eyes is enough therefore when you squint the picture to left has its high frequencey components filtered out the grin and the low frequency components are therefore more pronounced and you see the normal face and in the right pic you low pass filter out the normal face when you squint so the angry face is more pronounced the pics are originally from http www michaelbach de ot index html or http www grand illusions com without credit to any of them in the blog mind you

actually think that properly incentivised markets are about the only thing that can manage the transition from oil to whatever after all transition from one sort of fuel to another if it is solveable at all is massive resource allocation problem and markets have proven to be unbeatable at those so think it would be pretty good right now if rather aggressive tax was levied on imported crude and things that are made of with crude oil in the absence of such tax think we are in for rough transition

tried it itunes is still better and faster but will check out the future versions
the comments on the site itself criticize it fairly well ll skip the bogus comparison to and just name some of the problems he overlooks oil is used for lots of things other than energy plastics oil packs lots of energy in stable transportable form moreso than any of the non fossil fuel alternatives the entire world infrastructure is centered around oil changing to something else will take time money and energy the developing world is gobbling up pretty much every kind of resource so prices on everything and relatedly the energy required to get them are rising so yes there are alternatives and yes we can get better at conservation compare european cars fuel efficiency to american and we can get better at extraction which all should buffer things somewhat but real danger is there as seen by the economic consequences of the oil shortages in the and the post katrina problems don see collapse but do see some unpleasantness which could be reduced with foresight

comparing peak oil to is as dumb as it gets for one thing there is no economic incentive to hype peak oil as it was from the it consultants towards

think throwaway is libertarian in disguise playing devil advocate don forget the premise that only an arrogant fool could think he can reliably predict the effects of social policy if this is true then then how can we possibly trust anyone to have control over society any politician must certainly be an arrogant fool the premise is false of course that doesn mean that politicians are not arrogant fools it simply means that anyone who predicts the effects of social policy is not necessarily an arrogant fool foolishness is ignoring reason when making your predictions many great scientists were considered arrogant fools before their ideas came to be widely accepted as correct even ideas that seem obvious now
sorry don mean to insult anyone educate yourself
several points getting logic into education is great idea deducing arithmetic from simpler stuff is hard as hell unless you favor handwaving this is why it is so rarely done russel and whitehead derived arithmetic from set theory and am not aware of anyone else doing something analogous feynman derived all of algebra and the basis of trig and geometry from the counting numbers zero and the successor function but that is nothing like deriving arithmetic from logic not even sure what you mean by deriving writing from logic but whatever you meant it is almost certainly more wrong than deriving arithmetic from logic you obviously cannot derive particular natural language and if there are universal principles of effective writing doubt that you can derive those either therefore you greatly overestimate the domain of applicability of logic most of life is not amenable to analysis by syllogism so being bad at syllogisms is not so much of handicap so while it is bad logic to assume from the fact that your spouse car is in the driveway that your spouse is in the house it is pretty good guess further many people seem to get along just fine without understanding the conservation of mass evolution and bunch of other things that would call pretty fundamental it is strange that this is the case think

interesting actually had my intro to cs class with stuart he was really good teacher but found some of his personal views well out there which is of course irrelevant think what see as the primary fallacy in his argument is equating behaviour of computer program with that of society if the godlike predictive ability that apparently all libertarians have were available to public policy members the world would be much better place ll try to state this somewhat diplomatically wouldn be surprised to learn that there is are disproportional number of libertarians amongst programmers because in experience both tend to be priviledged white males with little international experience and say that as one myself albeit well travelled to grossly oversimplify my impression of their thinking seems to be hey work hard but that big bad government takes some of my money and gives it to those lazy welfare moms let get rid of government we can do it ourselves there are lot of problems with this if you travel the world especially to some rougher areas you ll see this isn too happy the people with power take more and screw over the rest the problem is pure economic efficiency even if you could achieve while being so ignorant as to think all people act fully informed rational agents is not the only goal there are also minimumal quality of life guarantees and other restrictions pollution to look at his minimum wage argument does this mean we should be allowing to exaggerate bit eleven year olds to work in unsafe mines they re cheap regulations are only the government interference that made those people so poor in the first place don get me wrong think capitalism tends to bring the highest quality of life to the most people in comparison to other systems the world has seen but it has to be capitalism with oversight whatever interesting discussion on computing but the libertarianism angle didn seem to say much more than why do people dismiss us as arrogant just because we say we know how to solve all the world problems
if that headline didn mislead you then perhaps your brain works little differently than mine pictured something like this hello madam do you like president bush meekly no arrest that woman the headline misled me and therefore it is misleading to me at least perhaps it is not as misleading to others agree with your second paragraph it echoes what said above with respect to rnichols wanted to draw attention to the fact that he has mostly submitted political stories if you read that other story on reddit about the minds of highly political people you might understand why that fact might fit into my rant about the untruthful headline may or may not be critical of bush come now do not believe we inhabit two separate realities each with distinct rules which would be the only way to explain you actually believing that

well yes and no problems with the os are not related to those regular tasks and the regular users couldn care less about problems when they appear they just want to see them gone and that usually harder in linux linux is not yet windows replacer if it were it should be as easy to handle yet ve spent lot more time making linux thing work and linux problems go away in windows things tend to be either more automatic or much more hopeless at least that clearer
could you give me some specific examples of inventions developed by muslims not trying to be snarky at all it just that have heard by several different sources that muslims have never invented anything and for the last two thousand years they ve been at constant war thought it was the greeks who developed all those things you talked about you know aristotle galileo copernicus methinks you re mistaken actually

meh the firefox linux no virus no adware arguments are somewhat moot when they represent large enough market share they will be targeted and while they are little more secure things will be found period and sure not the only one too lazy to only su sudo when need to love ubuntu view on that actually and xp rarely needs to reboot anymore less so than believe believe install programs are often just lazy or playing safe when they say they want to though yes kernel hooks seem to still require reboot drivers rarely at all and if you re talking about hardware unless you compiled everything as kernel modules then yes you certainly need to reboot linux couldn really live without my linux server pokes with toe but that the headless one right now slave to my windows box it just more convenient right now if for ever fewer reasons
can imagine scenario where intersecting seperate groups of hunters following safe procedures could end up in an accident though it should still be rarity but when one small group of hunters shoots one of their own somebody being stupid as someone who hunted as kid and then learned tactical military maneuvers as an adult be assured that what old dick did was completely avoidable the late night talk show hosts are gonna have field day
this is going to sound absolutely horrible but so what who cares what they ve translated what have they invented
sort of pity any country whose leaders still engage in bird hunting says lot about the current us administration hunter vp coupled with farmer from texas
you ve got to be really dumb in the head to lift your skirt and not realize your damn coot is showing and yet the media is obsessed with this person confused
am beginning to hate religious fundamentalists they are wholly without logic commonsense or compassion
sure the government will soon confirm his al qaeda links
why is it that the vice president is at fault here perhaps his hunting buddy shouldn have walked up behind him unannounced when he should know that it is standard practice for quail hunters to swing their shotguns around tracking birds as they re flushed out discharging ordinance which has wide dispersal pattern when you re shooting at birds it not like you re in blind focusing on stationary target with plenty of time to examine every object between you and it
like to see this cross reported in the japanese media foreigners are gullible enough to believe our reality shows are real film at
summary she interrupted cheney speech by saying no no no no she was asked to leave or otherwise face being arrested she refused to leave thus she was arrested don particularly feel sorry for her she was given choice although it does say lot about cheney lack of commitment to freedom of speech
so is he going to be charged can shoot hunter and not be charged
if shoot hunter by accident will also not be charged
heard on cnn that the elderly man he shot returned to the hunting group after shooting bird and failed to announce his presence apparently cheney mistook him for the fabled giant bald turkey rumored to roam the forrests of texas or maybe this is phase two of bush new medicare reform bill
envy her bragging rights
not if the victim was partially at fault doesn press charges and was only lightly injured because your gun was full of birdshot of course cheney daemonic aura and flesh eating halliburton lawyer zombies would allow him to get away with human sacrifice in times square but here it overkill
its really not his fault at all for those who aren reading the article and are making presumptions based off the title of this here you go gt armstrong said she was watching from car while cheney whittington and another hunter got out of the vehicle to shoot at covey of quail whittington shot bird and went to look for it in the tall grass while cheney and the third hunter walked to another spot and discovered second covey whittington came up from behind the vice president and the other hunter and didn signal them or indicate to them or announce himself armstrong said the vice president didn see him she continued the covey flushed and the vice president picked out bird and was following it and shot and by god harry was in the line of fire and got peppered pretty good
non sappy stuff and you guys still vote it down yeesh
republican spin we want to hear the real story the one where he guilty of something
you think that dick cheney of all people would shoot to kill
not quite she was brought in by shuttle required the choice was for the year old woman to walk over mile in the rain or to be arrested that not great selection of choices
not that it matters but registered republican and have voted for most republican presidential candidates but not bush
how are bush cheney events different from other political rallies plenty of pro bush folks are fanatical enough to try and crash democrats rallies why do we never see or hear them succeed and although not lawyer pretty sure that if you own piece of property you can throw non owners off it if that what you want to do remember hearing story on npr this american life about kid from san francisco who improbably got pass to attend one of bush press briefings then jumped up on his chair and started screaming at the top of his lungs to protest something bush called off his bodyguards and started asking the kid some questions about his political beliefs and what he hoped to accomplish with his demonstration the guy stammered and stuttered for few minutes realized he had no idea what to say and left looking like total idiot it would be nice if all our leaders could handle similar situation with the same kind of panache but we really should judge our leaders or condemn them based on standards other than the conduct of their security people
was listening to story presented on science friday show on npr that discusses an ieee article on the iraq power grid during that discussion the guest described some of the rules the security convoys follow when traveling the policy seems to be the following listened to it two days ago so could be off do not let vehicles get too close to convoy if vehicle gets too close fire warning shots if the vehicle does not slow down after warning shot then fire shot through the passenger window if the vehicle still does not comply then shoot out the radiator
agree with you on your points just want to point out that most people do think freedom of expression should have some restrictions suppose am just nitpicking but we have whole lot of laws and cases limiting freedom of expression for one you can express yourself by blowing things up there is also copyright law libel law obscenity there has always been balance between expression and order all this said think that the protestors are going against freedom of expression and cannot agree with them if your idea can stand up to criticism how great can the idea be
well if refused to leave yes think the organizers were schmucks for not giving her ride back to her car and pressing trespassing charges but also think she was silly to choose getting arrested instead of walking in the rain also think year old woman who chooses to go to rally for party she doesn support should be able to avoid responding to the speaker with primal wails that carried across an airplane hanger the whole story sounds bit bizarre from both points of view
gt farmer from texas yeah from that quaint little texas farming community called new haven connecticut
when don want folks claiming too old to walk in the rain
they really should have given her ride or something but this woman made some really stupid decisions you don laugh in court you don mouth off to highway patrol officers gt patterson why was taken out of the building gt willis what are you trying to prove gt patterson nothing just had an emotional reaction really don think the world is safer place under george bush and don argue with the secret service when they ve already been provoked that goes for local police under the same circumstances those officers only have few seconds http www gladwell com blink index html to judge whether you re threat to the person they re protecting and they re under lot of stress and they don care about inconveniencing you or hurting your feelings paranoid security people who we pay to be that way could credibly claim that patterson actions might have been diversion for someone else who wanted to harm the veep
can someone explain why talking to someone on the phone whilst driving is different to talking to someone in the passenger seat
sorry didn mean to imply that still not great choices though the really odd part though is this the guy told her walk down that road and leave or be incarcerated then handcuffed her read her rights and cited her with criminal trespass he then proceeds to give her ride to her car
don think she really aguing that she not suing or anything she just like the charges against her dropped
ok fine let assume this is in self offense some proactive protocol to make sure no cars get too close they are still shooting at civilians of the time and even if they are aiming to make warning shots they are still firing in the direction of innocent people and no matter how good of shot they are firing from one moving vehical at another they can be certain they won hit someone any way you look at it it just plain wrong ironically the us being in iraq is the exact same thing sure someone from al whatever could know someone else in iraq but going in there and blowing up buildings with shock and awe is just as mindless and just as wrong either way you re killing innocent people just to give yourself false sense of security
in the beginning god created the algorithm hmm programmer fundamentalism the essay reminds me of creationist intelligent design arguments evolution is too messy it more easily explained in this here book of poetry called genesis the author should at least get credit for explaining why or how so many programmers are libertarian and big bonus for pointing out how simplistic the philosophy is fortunately the big and messy world of people and culture is more complex than any contrived domain
certainly shooting requires concentration ve been shooting for years it also requires that you pay attention to your surroundings so as to avoid shooting something someone you shouldn

gt have heard of many more people going from the uk to us or even to india for their health care than anyone going to the uk virtually anyone travelling from the uk to the us for healthcare is going because treatment is not available at home not because the nhs is crap the uk has incoming health tourism from many countries but mostly european ones for obvious reasons it also noteworthy that americans pay more than double for their healthcare than people from most other developed countries gt myself would never leave my life in the hands of the nhs in that case you shouldn take any medical care in the uk gt not all doctors are trained by the nhs you neglect to point out the doctors from india and pakistan yes the uk does import doctors from abroad in both the private and public sectors but that is irrelevant to the op assertions that the nhs is incapable while the private sector provides adequate care as though all the low grade doctors are nhs while the hotshots are all private the fact is that you will usually see nhs doctors in nhs facilities whether you go public or private gt having socialized medicine is all fine and good when you are healthy but give it go when you develop cancer or some other pathology before you put too much faith in the us way of doing things you might want to read this from recent un report http www commondreams org headlines htm the infant mortality rate in the us is now the same as in malaysia high levels of spending on personal health care reflect america cutting edge medical technology and treatment but the paradox at the heart of the us health system is that because of inequalities in health financing countries that spend substantially less than the us have on average healthier population baby boy from one of the top per cent richest families in america will live per cent longer than boy born in the bottom per cent and the infant mortality rate in the us is the same as malaysia which has quarter of america income
was just reading the board myself it looks like aegis had policy of not putting warning signs on their suvs but they still would shoot at cars that came too close the posters on the board were recanting stories in which some teams would have to break company policy and put signs on the suvs anyway they thought the rule was ridiculous and was causing unnecessary casualties can believe they would not have warning signs that is the least they could do to avoid civilian casualties
hope you work for private security contractor otherwise you need to follow the law
my first thought when saw the article was don tell me they are going to try and justify killing people the same way they are justifying spying on us citizens
and while the english reads stay back the arabic says we re crazy motherfuckers who kill for sport
can believe that you would consider it acceptable to often have these vehicles carry warning signs the should always carry warning signs that is the least they could do to avoid civillian casualties

there nothing implicitely wrong with bird hunting except that since we re talking about cheney can for the life of me imagine why he didn do target practices with pieces from that museum in iraq you know the history of civilization and all the democrat wuss talk ve heard that what the looting was for you know shooting clay tablets with cuneiform writings like what are those for

not being able to follow gun safety rules may warrant suspension of your hunting license but don see why you would be sent to jail if the problem is that you threaten the safety of others while hunting and you aren hunting then there isn really problem cheney didn do anything criminal here it sounds from the article and some of the comments here that it wasn entirely his fault either so it may not even warrant suspension of his hunting license

personally don think all hunters do it for fun know when hunted did it to get away from the civilized world to clear my head also did it for food as reminder to myself of how wild things live and that meat is not something to be taken for granted didn need the food could obviously just run to the super market know that never had fun in the actual killing of the animals hunted eat meat so for me it was an experience to take the life of the animals eat first hand it was always respecful process for me as little suffering as possible only kills thought could make clean for me it was way to get away from everything and force myself to take look at certain aspects of life have always enjoyed meat fairly well so as much as possible when was an active hunter would only eat the meat that had personally acquired based on the slaughter houses have seen it isn to much of big leap to say that anything killed had better life up until their moment of death mind you have no qualms with eating meat just found it important at one point in my life to become familiar with what it really meant to take the life of the creature am eating the circle of life all of that if am going to be an omnivore that eats meat might as well truly understand what it means to be the predator that actually kills the prey do think many of the idiots down here in the south do it for the thrill it excites them think many have perverted what hunting was at one time and turned it into fun recreational activity for them for me it has always been somber time of reflection on the nature of being meat eater

no it needs holes like you
that argument hasn been made in the mainstream for about years think the myth was debunked pretty quickly well guess it is re use compared to non oo languages like cobol thats for sure so its all relative of course reuse taken to the extreme means macros that generate macros that generate etc still you end up twitching about with high level expression language that only the creator once understood then they rewrite it in an oo language think its more case of taking on more and more functional ideas and don think it really had much to do with lisp think it will have more to do with needing to be massively parallel to take advantage of the new moores law

are you claiming that writing secure code requires that you implement handling of all corner cases first time really don be silly you don forget them you catch those corner cases later because you review and test secure code several times in different ways what is true is that you come up with ideas of corner cases when you are implementing function first time but if you try to solve all cases right you really lose your focus often handling obscure cases properly requires much more than simple if clause if one case pops in your mind just comment that you can focus on that later and implement it with care

if you re going to write an entire article on why object orientation is bad it might be good idea to present som arguments that support this saying that deriving all containers from common base class is mistake without describing why it is mistake makes for pretty dull read while lot of what he says might be correct subclassing is not good idea to gain reuse he never presents any arguments for why this is so and indeed seems oblivious to the counter aerguments that exist subclassing spreads bugs but so does all code reuse member functions leads to bloat but convenience methods make class easier to use etc etc

its curious that software community endlessly talk about programming paradigms but never really draw strong parallel with the other industries which all employ pervasive reuse manufacturing engineering etc why do companies always buy their furniture systems off the shelf but rewrite redevelop their timesheet system sensible reuse starts not with endlessly customized software components but simple standardized systems services with well understood business interface what significant value does customized timesheet system provide over off the shelf one similarly for other systems performance management asset management erp hris and so on it could be that software is so critical to the enterpise that it must be customized every time for the high business value of information or we could standardize like say the auto industry where you can buy tire and are pretty much guaranteed it will fit although there are so many sizes and varieties yet all standardized the software industry must stop self flagellation about esoteric paradigms and intellectual masturbation and instead focus on the more compelling need to standardize its business interfaces hence software must look at business to simplify and standardize its tools are already pretty good as they are and discussed to death whereas it never really discusses business reuse

you know have to admit to uncovering some prejudice within myself after reading this of course the scientists would naturally feel restricted in muslim country and therefore they would emigrate elsewhere it is in less restricted countries where their ideas are developed and where they receive credit for their work this explains why never hear about arabs inventing anything it also explains why that yes horribly restrictive muslim countries will always have to be the buyers of new technology never the inventors also as long as country treats their women like property they will never have the respect of countries that are far more enlightened

think trudeau is just pointing out that it hard to be real world creationist or more appropiately anti evolutionist one of science great appeals is that it accurately describes and can even generate novel predictions about the world thus it is attractive both as an intellectual philosophical pursuit understanding the world and one place in it and as tool for problem solving curing disease developing new fuels creationism might offer some easy answers in the former case the philosophical but is not terribly useful framework for the practical agree that there is cheap laugh in there however

this article just doesn live up to its title and is subpar even for informit typical level of content the author starts up with paper tiger examples of bad libraries like the nih containers which were condemned as poor practice trying to implement smalltalk class libs in from the beginning prior to from my own experience then he attacks oo by condemning uses of inheritence all his attacks are examples of poor oo design and have been known as such for decades now all idioms can and will be abused so let deal with corrent practices well to be an oo language it must have attributes encapsulation inheritence and polymorphism is clearly an oo language but it is also multi paradigm language its template facilities especially when combined with oo feaures like inheritence make it incredibly expressive without giving up runtime performance as long ago as ve often said that given the choice between losing inheritence or losing templates in give up the inheritence but the flexibility of both makes uniquely powerful see coplien curiously reoccuring pattern of course everything just said is nothing new but that my point there is nothing new or informative in this article at all its obviously written with sadly not uncommon bias against oo but the correct conclusion is not that oo is bad or in decline far from it oo is an incredibly powerful idiom that will be with us as long as can imagine fortunately its presence in languages like and python have made concepts like functional programming idioms more available and accepted in common software development rather than restricted to the pure functional languages feel very fortunate to have both and see them as augmenting each other rather than competing concepts

it is not number itself ie population of country that necessarily dictates technologically advancement but the number or percentage of that population which is engaged in the sciences when intelligent design is taught as scientific theory it lowers the expection and standard of what real science is all about the global population is rising not decreasing have yet to determine by what method the experts claim the population will mysteriously decrease http www census gov ipc www img worldpch gif when the current facts say otherwise http www census gov ipc www popclockworld html
more photos here http www vce com rapatronic rapa html
there is most definately trend toward women having less babies as their education increases but global population has done nothing but increase since time began even if every couple only replace themselves each generation will still double if my spouse and have two children and they in turn each have two children will have four grandchildren if each grandchild marries and each couple decides to replace themselves will have eight great grandchildren
what kind of filament does it have
declining birthrate would only negatively impact the gnp because the gnp measures just that growth of more money circulating in the economy if the goals of country were stable amounts of money circulating in the economy but increases in education and technology and stardard of living the gnp would not be important
all true in my experience but then the question becomes if only unskilled oo programmers use inheritance why does it feature so prominently in most oo books tutorials languages and frameworks why not just support dictionaries of functions like in scheme or for that matter inheritance becomes even more of problem with type inference because it often make type inferencing undecidable given the choice between having the computer figure out my types for me and allowing inheritance rather take type inference but there already so much momentum behind inheritance that it be tough to switchover
unsettling

know that seed isn real scientific journal but it would be nice if their articles were just tad closer to science prions are interesting but it been known for long time that proteins can change other proteins structure chaperones at the beginning of the article he talks about the transfer of information directly from dna to protein as if it only that simple in fact there is large amount of editing that occurs between dna and protein some of which even changes the sequence of the protein also amino acid sequence is not the only thing that determines protein structure chaperone proteins can force protein into more effective but less energetically favored form finally he misspelled mendelian not good overall wish he had gone into the evidence of prions as hereditary material in which case might have been more convinced of his point as it stands this article isn particularly informative

that is funny way of conceptualizing right we all certainly have free will you can say whatever you want until you are physically gagged you can be wherever you want to be until you are physically restrained the issue is what are the consequences associated with your actions can the government punish you for your actions can other people punish you via the government for your actions is it ok for other people to threaten you based on your speech or presence to the extent that free society tries to minimize the circumstances that lead to punishment for speech or for peaceful assembly it maximizes those associated rights these rights aren absolute because the circumstances often involve other people and their speech and peaceful assembly also all these things have to be balanced but the goal should be to maximize the individual freedoms for everyone equal application of the laws and that may result in punishment for individuals that insist on needlessly infringing on other people rights interrupting private gatherings trespassing threatening and so on should say that unilateral claim that you have been offended is not evidence that your rights have been infringed in order to maximize individual rights we also have to accept that we ll be offended at times and perhaps even lot no one likes to be offended but the alternative is to proscribe speech so much that we all are limited to the sensibilities of the most easily offended among us

we are content happy sheep in light of two other articles on reddit today one about our level of wealth and comfort in the us relative to places such as congo the other about how people seek pleasure it easy to see that we don care because our liberties and well being have simply not been eroded enough guess some people are troubled enough to think about these things and write blogs and opinion pieces and there handful who are willing to spend time effort and money in active protest but they are small fraction of the american population the rest of us are still comfortable interesting that in order to incite rebellion and regime change we must make the government even more odious than it currently is

gt what we need is rejection of ideologies in favour of pragmatic commonsensical reformist truthful ideals think what you mean is that we need rejection of ignorance ideologies are fine as long as they are well informed the problem isn that people have opinions it that most people don have rational understanding of the world around them as foundation or framework for their opinions so the leftists who hate bush because they don like his texas accent beady eyes or odd facial expressions should keep it to themselves but like to hear from leftists who believe that bush is terrible president because he has demonstrated his incompetence to hold the position through numerous specific and verifiable acts ideologues who can make rational arguments backed up by solid evidence should be given their due consideration and respect regardless of what beliefs they adhere to don make ideology bad word just because of the things that ignorant people say or do in service to theirs

spif no don mean rejection of ignorance after all you can be perfectly knowledgeable educated psychopath nazism was well informed they had the gestapo after all but as an ideology it is not fine what is important about presidency or political movement has less to do with rational arguments and far more to do with ethics among other qualities you say ideologues who can make rational arguments backed up by solid evidence should be given their due consideration and respect regardless of what beliefs they adhere to that is nonsense again using the nazis as an extreme example and very rational one nazi could make rational argument about jewish influence and back it up with solid evidence jews after all did occupy positions of influence in germany to their numbers and yet we reject those arguments from nazis precisely because of the beliefs they adhere to instead of the problem being that most people don have rational understanding of the world around them the problem is that our elites not people in general don have an ethical understanding of the world around them one that is rooted in common sense memory and guided not determined by reason the problem with ideologues is they create rational prism through which to view the world in doing so they miss the forest for the trees

liked this because prions are very cool not only because of how they act and what they do but because their conformational changes will likely teach us ton about the problem of protein folding that said when the author writes gt biologists need to get used to the idea that there no end in sight when it comes to new insights and scientific breakthroughs an idea that has long been accepted by physicists who are subject to regular scientific revolutions he reveals how little he knows of biology and how little he knows about the history of biology prions aren that revolutionary in that of course we know there are non dna types of information whirling about continuously he doesn even mention epigenetic factors such as chromatin from evo devo to the molecular biology revolution the neo darwinian synthesis and even all the way back to darwin shows continuous large scale change in how biologists see the world physics has been the dominant science of the th century but we are now building the tools where we can begin to tackle something orders of magnitude more complex life think that biological discoveries will be the big ones of the st century and its not very original opinion

an ideology is set of doctrines or beliefs being an ideologue has various negative effects mostly because ideology obscures or alters reality religion is classic example of an ideology that tends to produce specific often one sided viewpoints which are frequently detrimental to followers of other faiths in american politics the left and the right have become like religions that are utterly opposed to one another take your example pragmatic commonsensical reformist truthful ideals is an ideology we liberals tend to think that ours is mostly all four of those things if may rephrase liberals concretely as democrats many of whom identify with liberal or progressive what you re saying is that democrats think they are reformist to pick an examples of quality think is important the problem is that the democrats are not reformist since they seem to be making no real progress or effort to reform american politics no rush to toss the thousands of washington lobbyists out on their asses no rush to limit corporate donations no rush to rein in the out of control military industrial complex or the revolving doors that send employees of this complex into public office and back again so this is classic example of the problem with ideologies adopt one that says am reformist and one need no longer stop to wonder if one really is working towards reform where disagree with the author is the wistful longing for more ideologues and tired of the constant left right nonsense do we really need to separate into two teams left vs right do we really need to categorize so incessantly all this does is lead to the polarization of debate we no longer listen to each other because we fit you into category of people we have already decided to disagree with as liberal how many times have you been dismissed out of hand because you identify as liberal or because someone puts that label on you and that way has an easy way of dismissing everything you say disagree with michael moore think he an idiot he also liberal therefore disagree with liberals judgmentalist is liberal what an idiot is this getting us anywhere or not

you re right adjusting my statement your way of saying it is more correct pointing my finger at americans that don do what they should do to keep people like the current white house administration out of power think justified in that

here question for anyone who cares to answer what can do to effect change put in volunteer time with the aclu currently every week work for political campaigns believe in when they come around yet having the right people in power or getting the courts to rule certain way doesn seem to do much and there no weapon to let one man stand against the entire united states security forces so what to do
that not what saying maybe my sentence structure made it unclear what saying is think guys like hitler mao stalin and to lesser extent cheney people who share characteristics with them are everywhere they re the minority but they are everywhere simply said it up to good people to stop evil people it sounds easier than it is in practice but you should at least try it easier to stop them early protests voting than later on war what was implying was that europe and some other countries are resisting the power grab of fascists the negativistic pushers we re not doing enough and we have the advantage of recent history teaching us the characteristics of fascists and americans haven really but at least most europeans are doing more than lot of americans who aren doing enough in my opinion can you see where coming from now

gt there was never any specific applications that would cause gt me problems this is exactly my point applications can bring windows down post windows driver errors can but not applications
so drivers not applications
gt guys like hitler mao stalin and to lesser extent cheney gt people who share characteristics with them are everywhere not cheney lover but it offends me no end to see you include him in that list of mass murderers you do an injustice to the tens of millions that died at the hands of hitler mao and stalin

agree with you ideologies are mostly identified with words but the meaning behind the words the semantics often get changed behind the letters like the patriot act so if you identify yourself as lt ideology word gt then that often loses it meaning after while and all people end up doing is fighting over the surface the representation the words instead of the meaning behind the words think the problem is that people like to compress lot of meanings into one word think and and will call that collection of convictions superheroism for example when and are good ideas the idea of superheroism will gain power because of all the ideas it represents however you could say you re superhero yell it out multiple times day so people will believe you re serious and still not do and but do and instead that is what is happening in practice people say they re patriot christian democrat republican superhero but the general population doesn seem to check behind that label is he really doing and they seem to stop looking as soon as they see the word superhero and start yelling at the other groups how about this for an ideology the world around us is made up of molecules around us at certain spot at certain time so there is truth it doesn mean we can figure out what the truth is but we know it exists and we know we can come really close to knowing it when someone says something which is clearly not true we say that clearly not true you re going against the universe or in other words when someone tries to sell you bullshit you just say nuh uh that bullshit have to have pretty clear picture of reality first to belong to this ideology though good luck with that in america or the middle east seriously good luck

that still doesn say much about the stability of windows ve seen the blue screen of death in windows xp often enough won talk about me which is what my computer had preinstalled gah ve had crash in linux and ve had the kernel crash in linux due to driver bugs of course ve never had my mac crash and abuse it as much as did windows and linux applications crash on me on fairly regular basis safari crashed on me today but ve loaded enough hacks on top of it be surprised if it didn and finder occasionally ramps up to cpu usage and stays there til relaunch it it still responsive just sluggish but ve never had to restart the computer except when installing an os update that do believe is the point the author was trying to make
said to lesser extent that means not equal but do think they share some characteristics of course think that cheney is responsible for far less people than hitler and that mao is the biggest mass murderer of all time more than million but part of the reason putting them in the same sentence is because want to help prevent people from dying hope doing that by writing this the more people we can prevent from dying needlessly premature horrible death the better no sure that mr cheney agrees with me on that and would defend my efforts of promoting this ideal sorry if offended you not trying to lessen the suffering the people must have felt under hitler stalin mao etc feel kind of pain when think of their victims please believe me and please help me it not that hard we re the majority after all

don have low enough level of knowledge of operating systems to say whether an app crashed it or if an app caused driver to crash or if it crashed for some other reason it been over year since ve last used windows and do not particularly recall any single application that would cause system crash simply recall having frequent system crashes which is my point recall one incident where could crash the system the exact same way every time using the same application but do not recall the name of the application it was an app used to view and rip videos embedded into playstation cds more often though it would crash and wouldn be able to figure out any specific sequence of actions that caused it with linux crashes were almost always repeatable and could simply try to avoid doing whatever it was that caused it to crash with mac os system crashes are non existant so far imagine it still quite possible to crash it but have yet to see it happen on any of the computers ve worked with if you really want more specific example can go use windows for week or two and ll let you know what happens

think there is so little reuse because programming languages are so immature the concepts that belong and don belong in language the human race is figuring it out at the moment at the same time in the meantime we are using what we have at hand at the moment it messy but it better than nothing because the languages aren good at reuse like oo isn really we have the situation you describe above but things are getting better better languages are coming that are better at reuse functional style single assignment languages are getting fast enough
in the past have seen this idea attributed to kurt von hammerstein equord divide my officers into four classes the clever the lazy the industrious and the stupid each officer possesses at least two of these qualities those who are clever and industrious are fitted for the highest staff appointments use can be made of those who are stupid and lazy the man who is clever and lazy however is for the very highest command he has the temperament and nerves to deal with all situations but whoever is stupid and industrious is menace and must be removed immediately however don have reference
gt nazism was well informed they had the gestapo after all but as an ideology it is not fine gt again using the nazis as an extreme example and very rational one nazi could make rational argument about jewish influence and back it up with solid evidence jews after all did occupy positions of influence in germany to their numbers and yet we reject those arguments from nazis precisely because of the beliefs they adhere to overblown generalizations and ridiculous stereotypes do not make for solid evidence at least in my little world saying that jewish people were influential in germany and so that makes what the nazis did rational is like saying that your neighbor makes more money than you do so it rational for you to kill him and everyone he has ever met maybe the breakdown here is that you re thinking about what would call cold rationality rather than ethical rationality but of course if you use only that kind of rationality then you can justify anything that not what talking about consider this argument http pixnaps blogspot com red pill ethics rationality html anyway the point is that nothing is inherently wrong with ideology even the greatest peacemakers scientists and philosophers in human history were ideologues it unbending irrational adherence to an ideology even in the face of evidence which invalidates it that is dangerous proper ideologue should always be willing to accept adjustments to their ideology or to completely reject it based on the establishment of new facts
spif saying that jewish people were influential in germany and so that makes what the nazis did rational is like saying that your neighbor makes more money than you do so it rational for you to kill him and everyone he has ever met first degree murder is by definition rational the insanity defense relies on proving that the defendant was irrational when committing the murder disagree that there are kinds of reason rationality such as ethical reason or the cold reason you refer to there are kinds of people such as people who are ethical and rational at the same time but reason is quite separate from ethics and reason has been used many times to justify anything from the creation of more hospitals to mass murder but sense this is an argument that will not be resolved between us and think we ve hashed out most of what we have to say on the issue so see you later it been interesting debating with you and ll be sure to avoid using the nazi comparison in the future

what you re talking about is fundamental and inherent shortcoming in the human reasoning process it applies to lot more than just political ideology words are an imprecise way to refer to concepts because words can have multiple meanings much worse concepts are acquired through experience and since everyone experience is different we re all talking about different if similar things even when we re all using the same words so it not that all those people who say they re patriots christians democrats republicans superheros are lying to you they believe it and they re not deluding themselves sometimes they do stuff that doesn fit into your definition of what it means to be pcdrs which is what makes you question their sincerity but it their set of definitions that determines how they label themselves so you have to be careful not to claim to have definitive knowledge about what makes pcdrs es because everyone who makes the sincere statement believe am is correct it actually mathematical fact godel second incompleteness theorem proves it sometimes you can see how tenuous the association between words and experience is by looking at the number of synonyms given language has for particular word for example in english we have words for flowing body of water brook stream and river to first approximation we use the different words as an indication of size brooks are small rivers are big in french on the other hand there are only two such words roughly translated they are river that flows north and river that flows south to be really pedantic different people make different choices when they have to pick out the relevant or defining features of thing or idea french people don care much about the size of rivers but do car where they flow english rivers flow all over the place and come in many different sizes in terms of political ideology people will define republican ness democrat ness etc differently depending on their own experiences with democrats or republicans superheroists who do and may be trying to decieve you but it more likely that they really do think that is an integral part of their secret identity as superhero and that and don matter and you can really argue with them because superhero is just word and they have as much claim to it as you do so we humans are kind of screwed because even though we all experience the same reality we can communicate about it reliably because we can never communicate fully what things inside that reality we want to communicate about the communication we do manage is in fact the best we can achieve and most of the political and philosophical turbulence western society experiences is therefore unavoidable if we weren arguing about our current crop of issues interventionism race fanaticism money we be arguing about something else feudalism protestantism catholicism fanaticism money and of course all the world whacko fundamentalists out there are experiencing parallel opposite issues jihad secularism fundamentalism libertinism money

the word ideology is used as an insult throughout the us nevertheless it is doubtful whether one can act politically without acting ideologically as well of course since the current incumbent of the white house ran on an anti political ticket and critics of the administration are often accused of playing politics perhaps politics is about to go into the same verbal junkyard as ideology however beware the unpolitical politician beware the unideological politician
where to start people who can make rational arguments backed up by solid evidence should be given their due consideration and respect regardless of what beliefs they adhere to that is nonsense substitution necessary to underline the stupidity of the argument that follows

ideology one entry found for ideology main entry ide ol gy pronunciation de amp je variant also ide al gy amp je function noun inflected form plural gies etymology french idéologie from idéo ideo logie logy visionary theorizing systematic body of concepts especially about human life or culture manner or the content of thinking characteristic of an individual group or culture the integrated assertions theories and aims that constitute sociopolitical program being an ideologue has various negative effects mostly because ideology obscures or alters reality you ll have to make case for reality first that to say it is unclear that it is possible to perceive reality except through the prism of what you call ideology namely memories hopes fears prejudices education etc we all operate according to an ideology in the same way that we all perceive reality differently the difference is that some of us realise it

words are an imprecise way to refer to concepts because words can have multiple meanings much worse concepts are acquired through experience and since everyone experience is different we re all talking about different if similar things even when we re all using the same words wittgenstein is spinning how can concept be understood as concept except through words here quote from philosophical grammar which you might do well to ponder how can one speak of understanding proposition surely it not proposition if it can be understood

you accept that you live in pretty damn good country and that you believe in the democratic process which means that you might not agree with the course of action taken by our elected representatives the hardest part of living in democracy is accepting that the other person won you continue to advocate and communicate your ideas in the hopes of changing peoples minds and thus affecting future elections and you should always remain open minded and able to incorporate new facts and ideas into your own thinking of course you could always run for office yourself

the idea sounds very appealing but have to say that this destroyed any credibility gt he takes comfort in the fact that history is replete with cases galileo pasteur lister where paradigm shifts were greeted with hostility history is also replete with people who claim that the reason their big idea is not going anywhere is due to the entrenched position of the community for every einstein there are thousand crackpots quoting einstein not that it is bad idea just that the rhetoric is abysmal

people today don care about liberty because the erosions are small if the politicians stay on the current course that will probably change that is the average joe will start noticing at some point and then they ll be mad it might be or years hence too think the funniest thing will be the reaction at that future time there will be lots of we told you so and lot of indignation the political system will swing the other way assuming and this is not certain it is still possible to throw out the bums with electronic voting who knows many people say it nuts to think that any political party would tinker with the votes the fact that gt of the votes in this country are counted on the machines of companies one of which was run by person that said he work to deliver the electoral votes of oh to gwb it no longer seems far fetched that someone might try and steal an election

my personal opinion liberals can fight the power because special interests control this country corporations are naturally right leaning there are few exceptions to this they fund special interests to lobby the government over time without any balance to the special interests we ve seen the errosion of many things in the us look at health care the dcma the entire battle over copyright and intellectual property in this country is being heavily slanted away from the public good and toward corporations the other contributing factor is the media owned by the right all the major news organizations in the us are very right leaning can hear the howls now but the media is liberal get grip remember clinton he was roasted over an open flame for getting blowjob in the whitehouse now contrast that with how bush has been treated bush has received pass from the us media yeah there was little furor over this and that but not anything approaching what clinton went through not even close so what the media is right leaning well it means that bush et al can do lot of things they wouldn normally be able to do the errosion of liberties the huge tax breaks for the rich going to war over lie all this is possible because the media either ignores it or downplays it or they spin it in the positive like they do on fox news the special interests media aligned with corporations powerless citizens that why the left have disappeared they gave up in the face of this
the article is from so the idea doesn seem to have caught on quickly
our country is pretty good but democracy is not the best system you can vote to take money and freedom away from other people and if enough people are with you it happens unanimous consent is better way we do it all the time naturally your friends vote on what kind of pizza to buy and if you don like any of the options you simply find food for yourself they don make you pay for what you don want what you won eat in democracy even if you oppose the war in iraq and illegal wiretaps and so on you still pay taxes to support them it hard to accept that the other person won because it wrong there difference between not agreeing with how someone runs their own life not your business and not agreeing with how they run your life but since we are stuck with the democratic process for the conceivable future agree persuasion is the best way

money would be good example one of the first things they tell you when joining the financial software industry is don use floats for currency and yet everybody does it anyway betting that the recurrent complaints hear about friends missing pennies from their bank statements is all due to round off error the current best practice expressing all currencies in terms of the lowest denomination of that currency is impractical because there are so many different lowest denominations and they even change look at the rule change couple years back that switched nyse prices from being quoted in ths to being quoted in cents fractions would be an ideal fit for exact monetary calculations

come at this body of ideas from studies of perceptual psych an mathematical information theory haven read wittgenstein so this may all be bunk attributable to lack of understanding on my part or that of the guy at wikipedia who wrote the article cribbing from now but anyway not pretending that my analysis is privileged that it exists outside the bounding envelope of what is expressable with words or concepts or whatever just observing that when individual people observe the world they ll percieve different aspects of the totality of the world that they experience remember only subset of those perceptions and everyone will organize maybe index or explain those memories according to different criteria north flowing rivers and south flowing rivers in france and brooks streams and rivers in english we all have words that we use to process to use an innocuous term our impressions of the world but since people have different sets of words they develop different priorities for categorizing things and those categories are difficult to detect let alone express even if you know they re there the other interpretation of your question is how can concept be understood recognized among different observers as concept the answer is shared experience which works because the concepts we use to describe the external universe don change the state of the universe itself although they can change our perceptions thereof which is another subject altogether so the goal is to consciously create shared vocabulary classic example is color my idea of what looks yellow could be different from yours because we have divergent experiences of yellowness but if we can agree on standard yellow then we can communicate about yellowness in the future we won however have any guarantees that what looks yellow between you and me also looks yellow between me and my upstairs neighbor of course we have probably been given similar understandings of yellow because we have common language and culture thank the crayon companies but that need not be the case for example when we talk about purple we re actualy referring to two different kinds of light one of which is slightly shorter in wavelength than blue lavendar indigo while the other is made up of combination of blue and red guess ve written enough does that answer your question

from the other side of the fence it incredibly irritating to be listening to woman with problem and have her not seeing an obvious solution immediately suspect she either doesn think or doesn care what she saying and thus become wary about listening to her problems in the future what don understand is why women do this communications fails most of the time anyway so why make it more complicated by not mentioning the intention directly just to constantly test the empathy of men men believe more in trust than in constant testing that why we forget valentines day and other annual things they just don matter for something like trust trust is earned by extraordinary doings not by buying some flowers well whining here women are just so mysterious

not really lt gt the point is and it is similar to much of what you ve written without agreeing that to speak of something as concept implies recognition or tacit agreement on the bases of conversation wittgenstein question about proposition typically mischievous is that proposition that is statement that proposes something cannot be proposition propose anything unless it is understood if it is not understood obviously enough it cannot propose anything and therefore cannot be proposition lt gt was applying similar logic to the idea that we are all lonely solipsists gnawing on the marrow bones of our personal universes and seeking pathetically to communicate with others it is modern truism that such communication is faulty partial etc etc lt gt this is not necessarily the case you posit the treatment of bodies of moving water as an example yet your lucid explanation of this in two different languages and cultures somewhat gives the lie to our melancholy solipsistic fate lt gt you suggest that the goal is to consciously create shared vocabulary and give the example of colour suggest that the shared vocabulary already exists by virtue of the fact that communication exists and that it makes no sense to speak of concepts without having that shared vocabulary already existing and in some sense agreed upon lt gt by the way colour is the oldest example in the book and have question for you if we all perceive colours differently why germans aside do we have relative consensus on which colours go well together

interestingly enough this is also considered very good way to deal with children not implying that women are childish often children simply want acknowledgement of their feelings but parents will tell them that they shouldn feel the way they do or offer solutions which discourages the child from finding solutions to problems him herself denial of feelings happens more often with boys which may help explain this communication gap between women and men when child bad feelings are accepted they can let go of them but when they are denied the child bottles up the bad feelings which causes much bigger problems it extremely common in the public school system too
men are trained to hide their emotions and only communicate concrete information women learn to communicate their emotions the emotion is direct it just that us men are mis interpreting the message by filtering out the emotional information

it had plenty of time and star power to demonstrate it usefulness and failed yet the idea didn entirely die if you compare literate programming to acceptance testing framework fit there are some clear parallels while literate programming remains tiny niche idea fit has carved significant mindshare so perhaps literature and programs weren as analogous as knuth thought but the verification tests for program now there are some facts for human consumtion clear space where literate programming could flourish it did but with common office apps instead of tex

if you say had del icio us tag reddit and anyone that wanted to post or vote on link for the delicious reddit just tagged it as reddit then the reddit community could exist without the buggy reddit code not that delicious is perfect mind you maybe delirious instead you could do the same thing on newsvine once it goes public but then you wouldn have the pwnz stz by disliking them so guess that wouldn work as far as not viewing karma as competition what the point then why have stats page if reddit has any advantage over other aggregators it that right now there is at least small hardcore group of people who are competing for karma most of them just won put it in your face quite as hard when they win wanted to see what would happen if did and found out but don fool yourself it still competition whether the players are comfortable admitting it or not and as far as only posting things that feel will really be appreciated that exactly what trying to do posting as many things that appreciate and that feel others will appreciate as possibly can just because hyper prolific poster doesn mean don read or care about the content that posting links to the attitude that must be spammer posting worthless things if post more than one or two at time is exactly what exploring in my experiment btw you are helping my experiment tremendously thank you and not using that term as shield or to demean anyone you are all very important to the experiment and hope we can all learn how to improve reddit through this experience

why does his audience not know what an sdk is
you know it is possible even if nobody gets ripped off that the whole idea of relative value at work and it the whole basis behind the free market maybe person values paperclip more than pencil and person does the reverse if they trade they re both winners this can go on and on it just matter of finding people with the right relative values along the way of course in this case part of the value includes fame which accelerates the process
thunderlizards must people invent needless cutesy words for basic ideas and the reasn his audiences needs sdk explained they re marketers so they have little to no undersanding of software or development which now that think of it explains the need to invent needless cutesy words for basic ideas

don agree with this but modded it up because it interesting and takes point of view that should be considered think it important to define what blog is because of the hype surrounding blogs and every new product or company in the web space trying to attach itself to that hype in some way per wikipedia http en wikipedia org wiki blog gt blog is website in which items are posted on regular basis and displayed in reverse chronological order that pretty good basic definition why get all angsty and stuff about defining what it is as long as there is plenty of breathing room in the definition

on behalf of those who enjoy reading the new page like to ask that you stop experimenting on it it might be fun for you to post links in the space of couple hours but hundreds of real people are having to sort through the mountains of crap karma is not competition it reflects among other things how much respect you show the rest of the community if it dropped hundreds of points when you started flooding reddit with links that supposed to tell you something if you must treat the reddit community as your personal lab rats please at least throttle back on the flooding it degrades the experience for everyone

hard to read
in my opinion being able to vote submissions down is important for example if an article makes strong points about topic so many people who agree with it vote it up but you think that it is invalid or flawed in some way overlooking facts for the sake of stating particular viewpoint you want to vote it down essentially it gives greater opportunity to the users of the site to put forward their views on an article rather than having to either bookmark it as mark of their approval or to abstain without putting forward their negative vote and yeah if something is overdone or uninteresting it feels good to vote it down all reddit does is to collate the opinions of the users chances are that people who vote something down simply because they disagree with it will have their votes overidden by the majority if the article is worthwhile bit of healthy competition with the karma might be good thing sure it satisfying to see that others think that your submissions are worthwhile but when it becomes so important to gain karma that you just post any old thing on the off chance that it ll be voted positively that just gets annoying that another reason for the negative votes not convinced that you feel that most of what you have posted is worthwhile but can very well prove otherwise so ll just have to take you on your word and have faith in the fact that the system will take care of itself if you re serious maybe you should write your experiment up as paper and submit it ll vote it up promise
google kuhn structure scientific revolutions and start reading the book full of holes but it incredibly important for educated people to read anyway
actually was thinking about it and you could vote something down on delicious or similar system by deleting your post of the url this is actually what goes on now on delicious really just wasn thinking it through earlier the thing is it makes it less likely that you will vote capriciously at least if you use delicious lot if you vote something up that means you like it enough to keep the post in your delicious cloud forever to have it on your delicious blogroll etc if you vote something down it means you don care if you have it in delicious so you can go back to it later sure you can give something an overall negative score that way but the system could allow you to set baseline score as pref so if something is tagged reddit then after it been posted for certain period of time if it still has score less than say it will appear as negative if it goes below or you won see it at all there could actually be set of personal thresholds you could customize for this behaviour karma is important but wouldn post any old thing just to get it understand very clearly that that can lead to the opposite effect but what find interesting is that even though wasn just posting any old things the fact that was posting so many interesting things all at once triggered the anti spam reaction negative reaction to high quantity of postings within certain timeframe actually led subset of redditors to refuse to objectively evaluate the quality of the postings am very much convinced that everything posted was worthwhile have respect for reddit and wouldn want to post anything that haven read and enjoyed myself just read and enjoy things little faster than most and ve read and enjoyed lot of things in the past very serious about this and will be writing up the results of my experiment still trying to figure out how will do that and post it without it being reflexively modded down by the redditors who hate virtually any blog and or meta posts but ll sort it out eventually

reddit may have positive feedback loop which would make it run away in one direction or another if one category of user outweighs all others pretty soon only content favored by those users would rise to the top and other users would lose interest someone should write simulator for that and then submit an article about it to reddit of course
its about paul graham for gods sake just click on the up arrow
yes it shows how the irrationality of agents in free market can be used for personal gain
he gives constructive criticism of ycombinator which is more than saying ycombinator has flaws he lists what the flaws are it significant because reddit readers tend to be paul graham followers

are you reddit asshole or like dollarwatch are you just plain old fashioned asshole especially love this quote but think most of the over demoters are intent on rating every single post to their own standard when rating posts had originally meant to rate according to dollarwatch standard or better yet politically correct united nations approved unbiased standard but got lazy and just used my own standard sure dollarwatch is correct and most of us assholes base our opinions on our own standards people like dollarwatch remind me of austin power father to paraphrase there are only two things in this world cannot stand people who are intolerant of other cultures and the dutch

they re not being irrational they just value the enjoyment of being part of this experiment more than the difference in their valuations of the objects they re trading you could argue that they re acting on incomplete information if someone decides that participating wasn worth it after all their negative experience will become part of their information so they don make the same mistake again all in all this is really interesting economics experiment

in simple terms interval arithmetic isn paradigm shift and there are several reasons for that it was explicitly mentioned back to and the first roots can be traced even to first it hasn found target group yet financial and business arithmetic need only bcd based arbitrary precision arithmetic they have well defined values mostly basic operations addition multiplication and the operations like power for interests which can produce infinite length results can be rounded elegantly numbercrunching fields like simulations fem etc are there is no other words for it addicted to performance they are using the latest equipment and are exclusively programming in imperative and machine near languages like fortran the majority or even assembly but this is afaik rare if you know these languages you know what people are sacrificing on languages to get fraction more speed they are absolutely reluctant to sacrifice speed for higher accuracy like interval arithmetic is intolerable they drop it no discussion now to physics or other fields interval arithmetic has several weaknesses which handicapped its use tmoertel has given one example if you have zero contained in the interval you get something like the dreaded inf inf result fine that the result is between the two infinities was obvious before the calculation several other problems the interval error increases linearly the error interval is the sum of the error interval of both terms but every physicist knows that this is simply not good approximation the error function is concentrated mostly in gauss shaped curve and errors tend to cancel each other you get ridiculously bloated error interval after some hundred operations another problem are periodical or multi valued functions draw the sinc function sin which is harmless and you get curve with different maxima and minima an interval implementation must find out the maximum and minimum of each function which are commonly used in physics and if you have an already bloated result it will be distorted even more but admit that interval arithmetic has its merits if you have mathematical problem where precision is not problem and where the behaviour of the problem with must be solved and studied in machine

ohh but wouldn it be cool
where do go to change said preference couldn find it in the article nor can find it in the firefox preferences
interval arithmetic and arbitrary precision rationals are completely different unrelated things you can use both of them together just fine rtfa also lisp doesn simulate fractions in its interpreter it does arithmetic on rationals and this usually happens in compiled code and the feature is available in quite few other not very mainstream languages as well
heres my take on the vc http www paulgraham com vcsqueeze html blood sucker response gt ycombinator invests about per founder so and others have no chance of making any money off you gt since there is rarely any competition for these deals you either take money from ycombinator or you don its hard to assess whether the valuation is fair or not dont know if can make more money off you gt basically at micro level ycombinator has almost zero competition when there is an imbalance of power there is the potential for the weaker party to get screwed there no way can bargain against ycombinator the weaker party gt hoping that more very early stage investors will fill the capital gap for the next generation of software startups sh hope this doesn catch on ll be out of job

not sure if its good form to reply to comments or not but will take the liberty of doing so the article was really intended to capture some thoughts both good and bad about ycombinator from founder perspective in fact all of my articles at onstartups com are directed at software founders so the idea was to try and provide some minimal education to those that might not quite understand the dynamics hadn expected the article to get the visibility it did and really had no intention of trying to claim position on the home page my writing style even when critical tends to be more balanced which some would classify as overly polite not trying to sound apologetic but find it hard to criticize strongly unless really passionately believe that the criticism is accurate and warranted in ycombinator case really do think they re providing great alternative to startup founders my grip is that there aren more investors out there doing this kind of stuff thereby giving founders more choices my focus is on founders and not on paul or ycombinator

think its perfectly good form to reply have at it ol chap if you need to start an article with don think paul graham has malicious intent or is intrinsically evil you except little bit more passion you have background in start ups so like to hear more about how you think investment with market cap around is too low sounds like reasonable argument to make but you don back it up much and you couch it in cautious self doubting language you can be passionate about something without being for or against it just explore it with more gusto

you really want to make moral equivalence to honour killings of girls oppression of women female genital mutilation polygamy you don say who your leaders are that you speak of but bet the worst of them don condone such things there are very few true leaders in power around the western world good deal of the reason for this is because of attitudes like yours that are self hating and make excuses for intolerable acts by repeating the kindergarten mantra of he did something bad too to deflect blame and support stupid and pointless political argument how can true leaders with real moral standards ever win support if the electorate consists of people with attitudes like yours in that respect our societies have very similar problems as the muslims if we all remain apathetic then we get this malaize and will continue to regress and devolve into an ignorant mob time to demand higher standards

the assumption that men and women communicate differently while likely true in many cases is so often used as an excuse to treat the other sex as some sort of mysterious riddle that can help but think it only contributing to the problem blindly relying on advice like this seems like wonderfully easy way to avoid trying to understand someone individual way of operating and an excuse for both of you to continue using broken communication system if you want advice you should learn to say that clearly if you only want to vent you should learn to say that too and if you don know which the other person wants it seems pretty clear to me that you should just ask them politely and respectfully flyingavatar wife seems to be able to handle this so congratulations to you both sir
ve run the experiment recommended is much better for me than hot topics recommended correctly suggested might like day old story that only had karma point now realize serious ui error on the recommended page imho recommended should not display the karma points recommended should display something else perhaps percentage from to that reddit believes will like the story reddit on the new and hot pages has taught me to not click on stories with low karma points this is hard habit to break on the recommended page where reddit is in fact selecting stories it thinks will like so haven been clicking on the low karma score stories simple fix to this page might also help train people on the remaining pages that the goal is to teach reddit what your like
really like fit love the idea its all about validating things in plain language its quite nice guess it makes sense that the concepts gelled nicely in my mind never thought of fit like that

didn say they do all those things said they use the same method to divert the public eye from the problems in their own countries even if those problems are totally different don think our western leaders are as moral as you think they are most of them are orders of magnitudes better than people allowing the things you mentioned but they are far from the ideal moral leaders and as long as people don see that the true leaders with real moral standards you mention won be elected since people won see difference between our current major party candidates and the ones from smaller parties that still have some ideals left

why is it that whenever anyone in the west criticizes their own government that person is labelled as self hating and accused of making excuses for foreign extremism think the point is is that there isn balanced view of the issue not taking balanced look at what may be the root causes of islamic extremism will solve no problems making pretty speeches about evil doers and barbarians burning embassies may win public support but it encourages no lasting constructive solutions to the problem so there this image of the insane evil islamic enemy created by western leaders and perpetuated by irresponsible media coverage either for uniting the country or for ratings that contributes to this unbalanced view of islamic extremists in no way am condoning or supporting the actions of terrorrists or whackjob fundamentalists find their methods brutal abhorrent and it makes me sick the way they brainwash their own people into blowing themselves up or hating non muslims but think that to ultimately defeat them we need to understand why the average muslim person can be driven to believe in such madness at least beyond the point of thinking they hate our freedom
the gatekeeping complaint is about opinions not totally crazy memes like postsecret and huffington post is gimme because it has an all star cast from the old media what listers are complaining about are blogs like instapundit boing boing and dave winer most recent boring and pointless blog all of which are popular simply because they re popular and the list popularity doesn seem to spread around very well in the gigantic blogosphere
that is very cool however have tivo series is there anything can do to upgrade it to enable this feature would probably need to add an ethernet connection right
decent read but was ambivalent to start with and the massive ads plastered all over the top clinched the vote just saying that you may wish to move some of those ads around bit to deeper into the article
mostly unintelligent rant by joel err some random guy think one commentor made the best point rails would be much better environment if the scaffolding feature was removed altogether while it was possibly intended as feature for rapid prototyping too many rails newcomers many who appear to not have had experience with any previous frameworks seem to think that this is how you go about building production quality app note to joel err some random guy buy the damn rails book know that amazon won put hole in your pocket it will make half your rants fall away
no that clueless there massive incentive to hype peakoil starting with the incentive for any two bit idiot to jump on the next big bandwagon to alternative energy companies to the media which benefits from hype any hype furthermore the comparison from me or the article is simply this just because large load of experts all say that is going to happen and it going to suck big time doesn mean that you should take it as given that is really going down that the full extent of the comparison ramming your peak oil crud down by calling dissenters dumb and or idiots is as dumb as it gets
you know what political argument aside this article sucks can believe the ap allowed this feed there are two spelling mistakes and three grammer errors aside from pitifully slanted tone boo hiss
mostly agree with you only dissagreement is that don think that was joel ranting just someone participating in the discussions on his site but yeah for now you need to get the book it really not that long the first pages or so are for very good walkthrough the rest ve only used as reference so far
oh my bad you are right it was not joel but at least the rant spurred some discussion

this is blog worth subscribing to they do their research and come up with interesting stuff it was featured as dreamhost site of the month some time ago and ve been reader ever since
they had chimp climb the rope with pin to pop them heard it on monkey news
hehehe all the fans are really hammering the forum now
how did people mod this to the front page while it was on the front page
okay let me start out this comment by saying that rails annoys me in lot of ways as well use rails for my dayjob and while enjoy it and the productivity increases are massive step over php in lot of ways it is unecessarily complex and like the poster stated lot of that comes with the rails rules that no on mentions until you use it it just does lot of quirky things that you don necessarily expect and lot of that comes from dhh opinionated software approach which quite frankly gets in the way lot of the time when you don want to follow the opinionated software approach that dhh has prescribed for rails and anyone who uses it yes you can customize just about everything in rails but that takes time why should be taking the time to redo something in rails that don like when could ve probably written it from the ground up faster and more efficiently its things like that which actually cut back against what ruby is in lot of ways there is more than one way to do it and are actually detrimental to what rails is trying to do fast efficient development but the first thing anyone needs to realize before they use rails is this you are not using your framework you are using dave hh framework that he is letting you use cannot state how many times he has said something along the lines of we do so and so in rails because that how think it should be he very opinionated individual and he rarely backs down so if you disagree with lot of his ideas stay away from rails or you ll find yourself fighting against them lot however some of the things that this guy is ranting about are stupid gt but do you remember that moment in the demo when the play turns ugly with big ole error page it when he tried to update his db schema or model or something it doesn work because he has to reboot the webserver before those changes take effect which he says and moves on quickly well it turns out that webserver rebooting requirement really sucks when you re trying to um rapidly application develop let put it this way big freaking deal restarting the webserver and this is only something you do very rarely takes maybe seconds to do whoop tee doo ll be the first to say that rails ain perfect it frustrates me lot but if you are going to offer some criticism at least make it constructive
yes think this is the first time ve ever seen dupe on reddit don turn into the dupefest that is digg and slashdot fear that perhaps reddit is outgrowing the small site it used to be
that why said they should check if it been submitted sans question mark for those cases where question marked url has already been submitted there no fix well besides the one everyone on this comments page likes
uhhh sex sells
what were the grammar errors
there are lots of dupes many triples in fact the ones that get onto the front page are usually the ones whose predecessors were around when the site had many fewer visitors and who therefore don remember the previous incarnations this one is weird though don know why this is happening
like rails lot and wish could use it at my day job but having to restart the web server because you changed bit of html is annoying http www ruby forum com topic new in any case yeah it has few warts but think it head and shoulders above most of the other stuff out there and ve helped build some of that other stuff
yeah exactly if the up arrow isn good enough just make damn comment
mysql is real worse is better play with it basically got most of the features of real database although afaict the default is still those shitty myisam tables it unbelievable how many mysql sites without even transactions are out there happily munging people money

mostly agree however one should take unconscious work into account reading poincaré or hadamard on how they found great theorems is enlightning therefore doing other things but not any and letting your mind work by itself is strong strategy if you manage to do it if you manage because another aspect of how terrifying are big problems is that you may not be able to stop facing them it is important to take these points into consideration because it makes all the more difficult to know whether you are doing bad procrastination or finding way to get into state of consciousness or unconsciousness were your mind operates efficiently all the more even as very often you do not find what you where looking for but something else which is likely to happen because you don not know the landscape before you are really watching it form inside can provide references if necessary cannot be accurate at the moment
what found odd was how so many commenters thought it was good thing there was no colbert report
think that the guy giving them their money telling them so would rate pretty highly on the important scale

so if mark this down does that mean reddit things don like it cause do like the story just not the dupe maybe we need dupe button inbetween the arrows to try and get dupes off the front page as fast as possible

year of the straw man argument ror fans have been the worst lispers havent been so bad
that the kicker mysql only structural problems anymore are that it has more gotchas but indeed default myisam still has no referential integrity or transactions you know the thing central to the relational model and the thing that allows you to handle more than one connection at once without screwing your data up their attitude of speed over correctness turned me off years ago don mind being able to turn them off for when you don really need them with warning messages saying this is an advanced option for users that really know what they are doing not as the default to the masses that just bought php mysql yay book it funny that mysqls claims of speed seem to only really apply to inserts and updates and very minimally on the selects the bulk of the queries in any dynamic content system and of course that alterations become as fast as on postgres when you do enable the things that make it you know adhere to correctness and stardards surprise surprise know
how about http sql info de mysql gotchas html vs http sql info de postgresql postgres gotchas html it old though number of things is probably not true anymore it not that long ago though and still fairly revealing of their attitude towards correctness me like guarantees since that half the reason use database in the first place and like features given the business choice probably use ms sql despite that have no ms love

still prefer to shield myself behind other reddit users they act as my filter on the world my prefs are set to hide any post that hasn reached at least points know know risk missing something that only would like and if all reddit users did the same as me then my scheme would collapse so far it working well though my thanks to all who protect me from the boring outdated and poorly written submissions and who delivered this cool chimera story

wonder what conditions are like for the coalition soldiers who have been captured has anyone seen an article about what it like in an insurgent al qaeda or taliban pow camp
not many get captured is the truth those that do get videotaped and ransom requested often they get decapitated most that are captured by insurgents are in fact civilians the coalition soldiers know better than to be located where they have chance of being captured sniped at sure suicide bombed yes but not captured
you call tha disturbing maybe you should see what gets put up on some of the iraqi sites some of which makes it onto ogrish com
but it doesn scale with concurrent access for smaller projects it is an easy and cool option though
laughed amp laughed amp laughed amusing keep up the good work
there isn much music out there that isn riaa it just hard to exist that way as company and riaa tends to be the least bother for many artists they handle the pr and whatnot usually if it suits them the case of the long unreleased fiona apple album because they didn know how to market it comes to mind thing is once an artist signs the music company inherently has medium term monopoly on the artist if you go by taste you basically have no choice in riaa nonriaa whatsoever that part not free market
you re absolutely right was actually making snarky comment about how the prisoners at abu ghraib are treated far better than captured civilians or coalition forces can anyone imagine captured westerner being given bible lawyer and due process by those people
what is this doing with points on reddit terrifying can only think that this is some republican ploy to paint anyone attacking bush as delusional racist blech
feel like most of his points are unwarranted and could have been resolved had the author done more research the users of reddit love heroes and fallen angels admit it is kind of refreshing to hear some criticisms of the much hyped ruby on rails

gt it makes me so sad that our governments continually turn blind eye to any of the root causes of terrorism focussing only on ridiculous notions of them hating our freedom that only lip service to cater to the unwashed masses the reasons for destabilising the area run deep and are explored in the clash of civilisations http en wikipedia org wiki it good read even if you don agree with huntington thesis
its too bad that stories about petrodollar and the iob allways gets modded down here on reddit can someone who press the downarrow please explain why
gt there are very few true leaders in power around the western world good deal of the reason for this is because of attitudes like yours that are self hating and make excuses for intolerable acts by repeating the kindergarten mantra of he did something bad too to deflect blame and support stupid and pointless political argument agree that there aren many leaders but think the reason is more to do with the fact that we have the presence of mind to not need being lead we can choose our own path the core belief of locke original liberalism was that we are not ruled by government we delegate to government
so it seems the riaa wants to limit people ability to listen to legal cd wait minute yet another reason not to buy cd
as understand it browser memory leaks come largely from the fact that js and the dom are separately garbage collected objects can be referenced between the two of course which really tests the gcs rules of cooperation imperfect in at least ff and ie in fact when reference counting is used you can defeat the gc in few lines of javascript and with the crossover it even easier possible fun reference constructs like closures help avoid it though think they can also cause it believe is the problem in ie is fairly unsolvable as it necessarily has crossover between the application and activex com reference counting yeah firefox has hope of fixing this since it handles both parts sounds like complex stuff though
think in most cases doesn scale with concurrent access is myth there no magic in other dbmss that make true concurrent access possible each one can only simulate concurrent access feel free to reply with counter examples

having to restart the web server because you changed bit of html is annoying you don don know what issue the poster in that link was having but it is not rails normal behaviour in development mode rails reloads all your application code on each request you should only need to restart the web server if you change the database connection configuration the templates also run live in production mode so you can change them without restart there too should you want to

yes this is one of the things that bugs me about reddit at the moment we need spam button and dupe button for each story as well as the usual up and down arrows
funny
can find two missing comma in and an extra one in the rest of the errors are probably acceptable since the article uses conversational tone at any rate the point stands why is an unedited article from an anti cheney author being published the very valid argument would serve its purpose better if it didn look like rant
at first didn catch that it was connected but then it just clicked and was amazing especially toward the end

first started using rails in november and while the famous fall from scaffolding the need to actually learn ruby and the hidden magic rules of rails can be abrupt have never been so productive in my yrs of development rails strongest feature is its awesome developer community the mailing lists the irc room everyone makes it their business to help each other out
not much there but it has potential
spread the word coffee tycoon is really boring tycoon game that sucks
denmark is about to assume the presidency of the un security council ve heard this before but didn see why it significant does any nation really have much power in the un besides the veto nations know this is simplistic but just have vision of the president nation taking roll call and taking care of administrative duties while the veto nations sit in the corner and negotiate the important issues
reads hmm indeed it seems judged too quickly just figured that since dbs tend to bottleneck applications to io the read write transaction combination cases that are allowed vs transactions likely being openings of locked files would make it just wait longer and be sort of fatal as in yawning when trying to standing up to hundreds of accesses per second like big systems may easily need to apparently not common perforance test case somehow they do note writer starvation problem but also that they improved it with locking journaling thing and they do note that they do have read write concurrency system through posix locks so that shared reading is pretty smart which is really the type most necessary it actually looks bunch cooler than thought being acid and all
gt they re not being irrational they just value the enjoyment of being part of this experiment more than the difference in their valuations of the objects they re trading you re describing irrationality gt you could argue that they re acting on incomplete information if someone decides that participating wasn worth it after all their negative experience will become part of their information so they don make the same mistake again all in all this is really interesting economics experiment again you are describing an irrational agent and trying to explain it by assymetric information
if you have to restart the web server to see changes to html you aren in development mode you modified config environments development rb to cache or your browser is caching like nicholaspd said the normal behavior in development mode is to display changes immediately

also should be mentioned is the buttload of money you re supposed to pay for using mysql for closed source commercial purposes from their licensing policy gt if you distribute proprietary application in any way and you are not licensing and distributing your source code under gpl you need to purchase commercial license of mysql this implies that if you have company that makes closed source product at all even if it completely unrelated to the database you have to buy commerical license vs bsd licensed postgressql completely free

gt you don understand our leaders are doing the same they just don go to the extremes they need common enemy too to divert the public eye from their own failures inside their own countries lot of small government conservatives are implicitly making the same point right now when they complain about gop legislators using pork projects to lodge themselves more permanently in office the elephant in the room of course is that the gop couldn get away with these shenanigans if the dems were stronger on foreign policy so what you really seem to be saying here is that the party in power gets to set the agenda that not even subject to debate it basic truth of politics everywhere think people are reacting to this post because it written carelessly the parallels you re drawing are certainly there but starting off your statement with you don understand our leaders are like thuggish dictators is either inflammatory or careless and of course talking about ideal moral leaders from the minor parties doesn buy you lot of credibility
we miss the end of the article here it is when interrogate prisonners they ll just tell me crap so that instead of discovering parts of the map it will add some more hazy brown fog of bullshit layer oh no no brown fog after all what nice with bullshit is that you can tell it apart from truth until you ve tasted it that way sure never to figure out that interrogation by torture is counter productive want public opinion to figure outpow vs regular criminals vs innocent people merely suspected of shoplifting ratio in my pow centers and want them to go mad when they realize that don care of these fucking figures in realistic sim bringing democracy and freedom will be undoable by means of torture and puppet politicians in real sim want factions news media private corporations asshole allies and friendly enemies to be buyable and to be able to buy me and my reelection campaign and want to be able to buy them nude zero gravity futureball championship overtime when need one about mission objectives want to set them all by myself during my election campaign want patriotic self censorship button to tune down whoever questions the logics of my goalsettings that would look like portrait of sen mccarthy want my firing everyone from cia board increase the mess done by cia field agents that operate completely on their own agenda want the game to start before the war so that can ask myself couple of questions is this war worth being fought among the wars that ought to be fought is this one the most urgent one if fail to identify the most urgent threats want my army to be stuck in my unwinnable war and powerless to fight my real foes and watch dr strangelove building nukes because he knows that ve shown that don attack those who have nukes and he knows powerless for some time

you call me riaa stooge even while insinuate they have and abuse too much power hm people who voted me down please elaborate on why wondering about your opinions since trying to adjust mine for reality what lie okay the hard to exist thing is perhaps little overstated was just thinking of the fact that riaa controls big bunch of the easier marketing methods while indie labels apply more to people taste using artists talent that not knocking either at all it where think fair bunch of cool stuff is too just saying that that can be harder process in the end from the label pov and for the artist who has to get known to be able to tour to make enough money to be musician though of course it works out in the end imagine fair number of musicians just go with riaa based companies because well why not it may be easier for them it works and they don necessarily see huge direct difference other than in the screwy politics riaa plays and yes know not all music is riaa approved my point is this list http www riaa com about members some mighty big names in there so just wandered over to my cds and took very rough was going by http www magnetbox com riaa search asp partial index despite that have pretty damn unmainstream taste are riaa based not that the low choiceness meant wasn saying there are no indie labels or there no good music in them it be rather silly to say that it the fact that if go by my music taste have no control whatsoever over whether the artist is signed to riaa company or not there more sony wb and less clear likes out there than like and if it coolness rather than politics buy by have no control over supporting riaa company or not give me workable alternative to that fact ll take it in second

there are few ways to define hierarchy of classes in an object system one is through extension some way of defining that class extends class java python etc etc javascript and io among others use prototyping instead of saying explicitly class extends class you say is clone of and then say by the way has this function foo also you don have big class definition you just prototype what is by declaration hello function clone foo function bar function mya mya foo calls foo implementation mya bar calls bar implementation mya hello calls hello implementation that said read through the nice yahoo javascript ui library source code is very nice example of some high quality javascript
yes the community is amazing actually think that community stems from the awesome ruby community more than anything have an example though not specific to rails about week ago picked up book called learn to program by chris pine at my local bookstore it more or less was the basics of programming with some other stuff thrown in and it used ruby for its examples it was very short and concise book and was enjoyable to read when got done few days ago the author had left his mail address at the end of the book and offered for anyone to contact him wrote out an mail to him about my thoughts on the book ruby and programming in general the very next day got page mail back from him it was very cool to see someone take that much time just to respond to single person who had read their book think this example is good snapshot of what must of the ruby and rails community is like the last rails app built absolutely would not have been able to finish if it were not from lot of help from many individuals in the rails irc room don know too many other frameworks or programming languages that have such an active and helpful community go to the rails chat ask question and ll get an immediate response ask question in the css or chat on the same server and ll usually get something along the lines of someone linking me something and telling me to read it lot of the rails people will actually take their time to sit down and listen to your problem and help you its extremely refereshing that for sure oh and mike in response to your mention on scaffolding yeah wish it didn even exist in rails because not only do not even use it but its extremely misleading as to what rails actually is people see video of scaffolding and think him looks like can make very limited apps very quickly rails realistically though is an extremely robust framework might even say somewhat bloated guess maybe rails needs scaffolding as part of its marketing but its certainly one of the things enjoy least
there isn much music out there that isn riaa there is lot of music out there that is not riaa that is why you got voted down maybe your taste isn so unmainstream everything listen to is cool and very small minority of it is on riaa labels of course if you like what you hear on the radio because you don actually have any taste then yeah you re gonna like riaa crap more often than not

you know see your point guess our disagreement is probably because don believe in irrational behavior because there is no absolute standard of rationality if you simply say that people are acting irrationally according to particular model then maybe it time to fix the model everything is rational if you change your point of view to match the other person even getting piss drunk is rational to many people because of their time preference for pleasure pretty sure based on your comments that you would not participate in such an experiment neither would but beware of assuming that you are more rational than other people just because they act in manner that doesn make sense to you perhaps they would act differently if they knew better but that is really just assymetric information at work

gt though reddit ui makes this woefully unclear the purpose of the up and down arrows is not to say yay or boo but to train filter think that for inciting people using this way of rating the karma system sould be rethinked because if everyone votes up or down for an article basing himself on his interest for the subject and not on his taste for the link then the submitters getting the most karma won be the ones who submit brilliant articles but the ones who submit average articles belonging to areas which interest redditers reddit will be filled with lots of mean and well rated stuff about the same subjects

you should probably educate yourself bit more on this matter collusion in online poker might be harder to pull off than you think the sites know who you play with and every hand you play and how you play it they automatically flag any suspicious teaming up or strange play of hands have friends who ve had their accounts frozen for couple days while the site investigated possible collusion and even if there rampant cheating the absolutely terrible play is even more rampant it is fact that it is incredibly easy to make good deal of money at online poker by simply playing well if few people are cheating you its hard to tell since there are thousand others that are essentially donating you their money

no rational behaviour in relation to economics is well defined to mean an agent that is optimizing their profits by paying for as little as they can and by selling for as much as they can you correctly pointed out that some of the irrationality could be explained by externalities like thinking you can profit in the future from the fame gained by dealing with the red paper clip person but having fun is not an externality not saying wouldn participate in such an experiment just pointing out that it not an example of relative value agree with you that relative values are interesting but the people aren trading with this guy because they really need red paper clip and all they can spare is fish shaped pen they are doing it for fun

the null hypothesis southerton specifies is incorrect the book of mormon claims that several small groups of people one or two families emigrated to the new world from the sinai penninsula if this were true then the small genetic pool from which the later populations sprang would most likely be very different from that of the middle eastern population as whole if genetic markers were overwhelmingly middle eastern in origin it would be indicative of mass migration not small scale displacement of few families

some good advice but imho not so good as scalzi lt br gt first while agree that the active voice should be preferred the passive voice has its merits it is necessary if you want to indicate neutral viewpoint and shift your role as narrator into the background if you want to makes it seem like the whole world sits around waiting for something to happen then it is the perfect approach lt br gt and no please please don invite people to use propped up metaphoric language these kind of language is an inexhaustible source of unintended humor like the linebacker stripped the running back off the ground lt br gt and third he criticizes scalzi because scalzi didn use the rules of sentences but he freely admits that he himself isn able to come up with good definition of sentence my mother language has actually more than rules of grammar and no never indulged to learn them by heart learned to use them by reading in fact many writers don care to learn them
first genetic markers are usually compared to population via frequency given set of markers will have particular distribution for given population however small draw from that population will most likely not be very representative hence the distribution of markers in population that arose from small sample of the large distibution will not closely mimic that of the large population from which it was drawn second if large scale massive migration occured from northern asia the more massive and the later that migration occured the more likely the population would have similar distribution of markers to that of the parent population that we see in northern asia today what the current genetic research indicates is that there was migration from northern asia this does not preclude small group migration from the middle east or anywhere else previous to the asian migration

think that non governmental metal backed currencies will fail because they solve only the inflation problem economies have many other needs that are not met by metal backed currencies for example currency exchange provides important indicators of economic health country sharing currency with another is more vulnerable to the other economic troubles than country with its own currency so far the only countries that decide to share currency also share significant regulatory infrastructure for example the eu dominant countries and their colonies the usa anarchists who oppose such regulation would support metal backed currency but the reality is that the world is not anarchist and governments need to manage their nations modern currencies facilitate their management history has shown that countries move to modern floating currencies and prosper after wwi japan followed other countries in leaving the gold standard then in january of they decided to return to it fixing the price of the yen to specific amount of gold even with the onset of the great depression the government went ahead it was compared to opening shutters in the middle of typhoon exports were stifled and the economy floundered the government pretended that everything would be ok and that through the failure of non competetive firms the economy would benefit in the long term two years later in dec japan left the gold standard the value of the yen was allowed to float it immediately dropped by the government invested in industry by issuing bonds what some call debt call investment through the application of keynesian economic policies japan was one of the first nations to recover from the great depression source of previous paragraph spring lecture by dr goto shibata associate professor of international history chiba university japan finally what happens to metal based currencies when space elevators are built and metal from the asteroids floods the market see this happening far before the usd fails

however it does mean that efforts at conversion that hinge on the alleged middle eastern bloodlines are bogus and let face it the possible ambiguity of this is just one genetic result which if nothing else is at least some kind of evidence on the issue in the grander scheme the mormon mythology make number of claims that are generously difficult to accept at face value

like the idea of distributing video content through putting it on your ipod at the local blockbuster certainly solves the problem of day long downloads for decent quality movies since apple controls the ipod internals there shouldn be any drm problems however the whole deal sound very speculative to me if the blockbuster management is so clueless why should they even talk to steve jobs
must have slept with some career criminals then
since the site has no comments enabled shall do it here is jobs negotiating with blockbuster only heard it here however if one accepts the premise outlined why so short sited why wouldn applebluster the new hardware as well for say mo in perpetuum this would go toward financing forever charges lost broken equipment insurance oh yeah the ipod tends to die right after the warranty runs out can you really get insurance for product like that the google musings are somewhat more compelling

didn expect this to last on the front page all night ve been familiar with this type of dna testing for few years and ve sensed no change in the doctrine surely anyone who cares about mormonism has heard this before so don see how it qualifies as new on the net anyway the reaction inside the church is usually mix of danteembermage one or two families isn large enough pool for statistical significance and the more true believer style of god works in mysterious ways there are few who leave the church like the guy whose picture is on the right side of the article but he actually born again christian now dna disproves the book of mormon so surely the answer is that the earth is years old or at least he appears in several anti mormon pro born again videos personally don know of anyone who is mormon because of the scientific support most believe because they have had personal experiences that led them to believe and most continue believing because the lifestyle and culture makes them happy and many stop believing if it doesn make them happy one of the many reasons like mormonism is that think it ballsy for joseph smith to have made so many falsifiable claims even while he was alive people were crying foul and disproving the faith and it continued to grow then and continues to grow now it either sign that the religion has something very good or that people are really stupid or both

the principle of scientific plausibility suggests that the reasonableness of any hypothesis is proportional to the ratio of data points to assumptions in this case the ratio is very small the hypothesis in question is but one of many that could be produced by variation of the numerous assumptions the selection of this specific hypothesis for publication perhaps says more about the motives of its proponents than about the subject matter observe that the comments here about what mormons believe and why sometimes contain small grain of truth perhaps to lend plausibility to what is being said but are generally incorrect or misleading in their presentation the focus and purpose of the book of mormon is not history and it so states in numerous places its authors intended the book to serve as witness of jesus christ as the savior of mankind to explain what that means and to provide some insight into the grandest questions of human inquiry namely who are we what are we doing here on this planet and what does the future hold for us the final author of the book of mormon lays down challenge and promise that those who read the book with sincere intent can ascertain for themselves whether the book is true or not by studying it pondering its message and praying about it on that basis it should be considered an error for anyone to blindly take someone else word that it is either true or false another observation is that many who reject god do so by engaging in straw man exercise that is they posit the existence of demonstrably false god and then proceed to demonstrate that he doesn exist big surprise there and yes aware of the potential circular logic of that statement but if it true it isn circular finding god may be difficult but in my experience it is worth the effort and surprisingly enough it doesn require one to abandon science disparage the beliefs of others or engage in wanton acts of violence at least not if you find the real god so be careful out there

suspect it much the same as with most religions it gives people something that makes them feel really warm and fuzzy and although stupidity is not outright required it certainly doesn hurt that about half of them are of below average intelligence worldwide the vast majority of religious people are religious because their parents brought them up that way mormonism is actually unusual in that it actively gaining adult converts most of the major religions do not at least not in any significant numbers they merely raise their members children to be new members minor brand new religions and cults have to convert of course but mormonism is no longer really small enough to be counted as minor imo most major religions missionary enterprises are feel good undertakings with comparatively little impact on membership numbers disproving religion is seldom much to brag about especially when the religion is relatively new look how easy it is to poke holes in scientology such disproofs never accomplish anything useful almost no religious people believe because they feel they ve seen rational logical evidence to believe the vast majority of them believe because they want to and will flat out ignore refutations that might otherwise cause them to stop doing this thing they want to do it really doesn matter who the native americans are descended from or how well you prove it if people are to this day capable of believing that life on earth has not descended from common ancestor or that the space dictator xenu imprisoned trillions of souls in volcano or whatever it was hubbard babbled about they ll believe anything that makes them feel good enough no matter how ludicrous
gt but if it true it isn circular wrong actually logical circularity has nothing to do with truth circularity merely demonstrates that the argument doesn logically demonstrate any truth circular argument might be stating set of truths if only by accident but you have to use some other non circular argument to show it
maybe you can make that up but at least you could spell his name correctly
this is stupid article with misleading headline on reddit and doesn say that crichton was bush global warming advisor just that bush read one of crichton books so bush took meeting with michael crichton and that means now crichton is advising him breathtaking news analysis
the scary thing is he actually getting paid for this dreck wish my job was that easy actually have to use my brain to get anything done

think you re missing the point on this somewhat orwell is writing about the dangers of suppressing the truth and tacitly supporting suppressing the truth at the time shortly after ww when russia was new ally the ussr was in this role and it had supporters on the left to grossly simplify which abetted its suppression the relevance today is that the current forces in power in the us the right to grossly simplify are now the ones involved in suppressing denying and re writing the truth some quotes from the essay found particularily relevant some eerily so years later totalitarian state is in effect theocracy and its ruling caste in order to keep its position has to be thought of as infallible but since in practice no one is infallible it is frequently necessary to rearrange past events in order to show that this or that mistake was not made or that this or that imaginary triumph actually happened the sort of things that are working against him the writer attempting to report the truth are the concentration of the press in the hands of few rich men the grip of monopoly on radio and the films totalitarianism demands in fact the continuous alteration of the past and in the long run probably demands disbelief in the very existence of objective truth mr orwell seems pretty clever guy although found his ramblings on poetry in the essay bit odd

maybe the problem is not with the curriculum but with the teachers think the biggest problem with science teaching is that it mostly is done by people who just teach from text book avoiding any passion for explaining things plus it is also unfair to the teachers if they are underpaid and have class with too many students to deal with they tend to go for the middle of the group and the outliers get dumped maybe that the guy who wrote the article never understood what it is good for

propaganda see nothing implying any sort of judgment on the person or his race or nationality in that article if anything it puff piece in his favor you seem to be anticipating negative reaction from westerners here on reddit about what he does if that feeling is correct it says more about the west feelings on gov beheadings than the author or even the reddit submitter the key tenet of propaganda is that it is clearly didactic it doesn try to evoke the reader already formed sentiments on an issue but it tries to tell the reader what he should think didn see anything saying this guy is an evil islamist that should be eliminated in that article suggesting such didactic element is present when it isn clear is to reduce the word propaganda into meaninglessness at that rate anyone trying to make any sort of point whatsoever is propagandist including yourself
sure education might not be working too well but from there to saying that people shouldn learn algebra there about megaparsec not sure how much give credence to that teachers are underpaid thing it varies lot from country to country but in many countries teachers are very well paid comparatively have great holidays and incredible job security also there some tentative evidence that payment of teacher doesn correlate with quality of education but social prestige of teachers correlates more

it interesting the number of comments on this post einstein said no amount of experimentation can ever prove me right single experiment can prove me wrong so before you let out your hurrahs let just first point ou that neither the book of mormon nor mormonism dispute that there could have been other peoples in the americas in the past does this article really prove anything what if in few years hebrew blood is found in some american natives will this then require everyone to accept mormonism at face value enjoyed the article by michael crichton posted here at reddit that showed the doomsdayers of years ago talking about the impending global warming no global cooling if there anything to science it the word theory not that some theories aren better than others but by the very nature of being theory it isn free from dispute find the need for others to label mormonism cult or sect says more about their need to label it than any inherent reality how many cults have million worldwide members and engage in the activities that mormons do by their fruits ye shall know them ll tell you why the church doesn sit around responding to every person who tries to discredit it what would be the point those who want to discredit the church won listen and those who believe for the most part can come to their own conclusions and yes mormon no amount of scientific convincing will sway me either way on that for or against my convictions come from other sources
did you read the article he didn violate any federal law on the other hand if this was really the beginning of fascist state as the guy with the truck asserts don think we ever have heard from him at all

even if the law said he couldn have signs on his car it selecitve enforcement for political purposes clear violation of the st ammendment but what the regulation says is that he can affix the signs while on government property he didn he put the signs on his personal property and then drove that personal property to work that may seem like tecnicality but the regulation clearly was written with affixing signs to federal property in mind he didn do that the political enforcers are trying to make the regulation apply where it wasn intended but literal reading of the regulation thwarts that
that may be bit of an exageration however gold prices have gone up significantly in the past months
scientist is hardworking studious detail oriented observant intelligent exacting and patient when think of scientist think of someone who sets out to find the facts without predetermining what the outcome is during this process scientist must be fair honest and unbiased scientist must be exact by following all directions and recording every step and observation so that the experiment can be reduplicated he she must check and double check all of his her work scientist is very important in our lives because all of the experiments he she does in the lab can affect our health environment nutrition and other aspects of our daily and future life this comment from the article front page was supposedly written by seventh grader impressed the vocabulary and sentence structure as well as the ideas are all quite advanced for that age it makes me little suspicious of whether the subjects used are typical for example throw that quote into word and run spellcheck notice that the flesch kincaid grade level http en wikipedia org wiki flesch kincaid estimate is this passage is understandable by someone with grade language skills or above odd to be fair it could be that the class reviewed relevant terms exacting predetermined and that the use of these in the quote drives up the score it specialized vocabulary still
uhhhh no don think he was stupid just think he would have been unable to author the book for instance you sound and write intelligently but don think you could write something comparable to the book of mormon in three months or over any length of time for that matter but that doesn mean you re stupid critics of joseph smith say he indolent stupid immoral and most fundamentally fraud however by arguing that he didn receive divine help in translating the book they are left trying to explain how it came about and how it could affect millions of people around the world even decades after his death am wondering the same thing
the article is interesting but enough with the inflammatory headlines nowhere does the article say that the judge declared the us uncivilized this is what the article actually said the judge decision came after day long hearing during which he commented that america idea of what constituted torture is not the same as ours and doesn appear to coincide with that of most civilised countries the judge remarks are sharp criticism of the us treatment of inmates but stop well short of condemning an entire nation as uncivilised dandare you should be more honest than this

wonder if these scientists set out to disprove the hebrew link doubt these were lds scholars out to prove the hebrew native american link even if they were lds scholars who found no link it would make precious little difference here why there are four possibilities regarding this evidence the scientific data is true there no connection the book of mormon is falsse the scientific data is false the conclusions were inaccurate the book of mormon is still safe the scientists twisted the data to meet their objective to disprove the book of mormon making their claim irrelevant the data is true but there is another explanation there were existing natives in the americas nowhere does the book of mormon say that there weren three out the four possibilities mean very little in fact the first possibility that there actually is no link means very little to either the believer or the non believer both will find way to fit this article into their existing mindset the author of the article probably knew this and had to throw in an lds member whose faith was shattered likely this man was already on path looking for something to shatter his faith so he could feel justified in embracing new lifestyle those who have received higher witnesses from god that the book of mormon is true have witness from an infallible source so when men come out with scientific data the average lds person will look at the data and think about the four possibilites wrote about on the other hand those who love to hate mormons will grab whatever evidence supports their hatred and try to stretch it as far as it will go no link see the book of mormon is false in fact the la times article was predictably slanted the leftist anti religion sentiment reeking pungently like thaabit says there are higher sources that can inform any sincere truth seeker the veracity of the book of mormon those who love to hate the mormons will never ask god in sincerity if the book of mormon is true simply because it doesn fit their creed but if you want to find out for yourself pick up copy read it and ask god with sincerity if it is true it works every time once he tells you it is true articles like these will be as meaningless to you as it is to me

so your definition of clear case of harassment is notifying someone he in violation of statute that pretty weak definition which makes it effectively useless for purposes of conversation unless of course you re looking to simply reinforce your own prejudices ve had my share of cops telling me to get off my skateboard take my protests elsewhere etc but even know that just as authority doesn make you automatically right it doesn make you automatically wrong either the fight the power types would have lot more leverage if they weren reflexively rebelling without cause
since when has something like the constitution prevented the government from enacting whatever laws it sees fit whether it be smoking doobs in the privacy of your own home or firing ak on the privacy of your own range the government never let anything like the bill of rights stop it from restricting behavior for the common good that means your second question is also resounding of course they could

the regulation read said you can post signs or flyers on gsa controlled property whether that means on actual gsa property or on any property that then appears on gsa property is certainly up for debate but that the rub at most it meddling dispute about the language of the regulation and not some oppressive stifling of free speech like the whole thing with cindy sheehan at the state of the union address and how nobody made mention of the pro bush supporter who was asked to leave for the same reasons this strikes me as classic bureaucratic ineptitude being twisted into some conspiratorial stifling of political dissent it reminds me how in my heady days of rebellious youth tried to turn the skateboarding ban in my town into civil rights issue

please it not like it supremely well written it good story with literally almost thousand occurrances of the intellectually vapid phrase it came to pass the book of mormon doesn take great writer it takes creative person with good knowledge of the bible which smith clearly had and regardless you re still equating the likelihood of magic with the likelihood of lying simply because you think smith incapable of writing the thing that at best insipid reasoning and at worst mere apologism

while examples of his perfection oriented people often knowing better way to do things can be given would be interested in knowing which group actually gets more done though to be honest splitting everybody into two schools of thought us and them then comparing them is something see frequently in geek writings and have become skeptical of these days it strikes me as self affirmation of the way the author audience behaves has the perfection oriented author ever given performance oriented jobs go or is he arguing why you should not use particular method that he himself does not know anything about

most people can not be categorized as strictly perfection oriented or strictly performance oriented think people generally make an estimation how important is this peace of software to me do need to use it often are there alternatives which already master to greater or lesser degree etc etc from this ppl decide if its worth their time learning all the bells and wistles of particular program many times it just plain laziness for example have never bothered learning emacs there are many alternatives that work just as well and easier to learn and dont consider it worth my time learning all the keyboard commands the same goes for latex when was writing my thesis needed to include lot of mathematical equations and formulas thought about doing it all in latex because it would be faster than clicking formulas in ms equation editor but reasoned it would take me more time learning latex syntax than just using tool already master so ended up clicking in equation editor now had spent some time years ago with latex
you know this is all rather obvious when you think about but thanks for the statistical verification it makes sense because attractive people are almost always favored over ugly people in this society the disfavored ie ugly black poor go into what they can crime
yes they certainly would sadly those silly fight the power people seem nebulous because what they re fighting wouldn be problem if it weren so nebulous tenuous and hard to define if it were obvious then everyone would easily notice it and deal with it you can boil frog to death in an open pot if you turn the heat up slow enough the same frog will jump out if you throw it in boiling water we are that frog and the situation increasingly reminds me of they thought they were free the germans http www press uchicago edu misc chicago html initially the biggest impediment to correcting these nebulous general social and governmental problems is lack of knowledge this is precisely what dwight scarbrough seems to be fighting against he taking the most high visibility thing in his life and using it to get people to think just think he has no idea what else he can do but at least he can tell people that he thinks things are wrong don diss his attempt he cares because he seen the worst side of our government his increased sensitivity to these kinds of things is an asset to us all he been in the pot when it was boiling he someone who knows

ve never used ms equation editor but when we were taught latex at uni we were warned about getting sucked into the presentation language and spending our time fine tuning optimizing or extending instead of actually getting work done this was good advice can imagine latex being trap for perfection oriented people it very easy in latex to feel that anything short of perfect elegance is unnacceptable
people who get mad about this thing don understand how trademarks and branding works this reminds me of the sambuck coffee deal some chick thought she be cute and name her coffee shop sambuck coffee and acted all suprised when she got sued companies are required to enforce their brands this may sound silly but even though there may very little confusion between dell the computer maker and paul dell little web design company they still have an obligation to enforce their trademarks if they do not later down the line some company might really try to rip dell off and when dell takes them to court they can point at dellwebsites and say see dell doesn enforce their brand you may laugh at this but it happened before escalator lost their brand name because they didn enforce it if court does find with paul dell then great specific differences will be cited in court ruling which will draw clearer line dell can continue to sue other people if it thinks they have gone too far you have to enforce your trademark even in silly cases or you loose it
didn miss that it was an attempt at parody was pointing out that it was an inept attempt at parody to do good parody you have to have some familiarity with the thing you are trying to parody suppose you re trying to parody harry potter but you haven read the harry potter books so you think harry potter is six foot tall boxer with receding hairline then you write story in which two of harry friends are talking about how harry can represent hogwarts in the triwizard tournament he has to visit his mom in salisbury see it not much of joke it just dumb
you make an excellent point not only is it impossible to classify people into one of two buckets on the issue of how much time they are willing to spend learning tools it is probably even impossible to place all of them at points on continuum the two questions of whether you are willing to try better ways to work is orthogonal to whether you actually spend the time right now to do them this can easily be illustrated by pair of examples the easier one for the author to deal with is someone who neither does much work nor learns much the author would probably call them lazy performance oriented person the hard example is someone who knows that there are better technologies and methodologies out there and puts them on stack of things to check out so guy who needs particular program done immediately does it and then learns better ways to do stuff when if he has time later this person does not classify in the author system

to be honest think that domain names registration needs to be little tighter take look at whitehouse com or whitehouse org those sites are plainly based on the idea of fooling consumers into thinking they ve found whitehouse gov along with yahooo com and the rest those should be shut down since they aren trying to make their own brand they re preying on consumer confusion then there things like paypa com which are straight up fraudulent on the other hand site like microsoft sucks com is fine since it perfectly clear to the consumer that the site is unaffiliated with the real ms
on the face of it that sounds like great system the court will find in favour of paul dell and nobody can say dell isn vigorously defending its brand but what about when paul dell can afford to risk his livelihood defending his rightful claim to his own name and capitulates dell half hearted attempt to preserve its brand via case it doesn even expect or need to win ends up forcing businessman to change his company name serious setback for budding startup if it ends up costing lot of money why even if he wins the case he loses due to the time he has to waste winning it even think that system is unfair mean for god sake the guy father was named dell his father was named dell and so on the guy shouldn have to pay any penalty time or money for using that name now if there was real evidence that the guy was trying to make people think his company actually is dell his logo looks similar to theirs then would be completely on dell side
sql does all the nice things you described on one machine in process that because we already have an os running on that machine and it has some locking primitives that the sql engine library is using don agree with the extending that conceptually to multiple machines isn that hard to do it hell of lot harder you have to implement some sort of distributed os first so you have locking over multiple machines or maybe if am missing your point can you please explain

not quite one of his contentions is that in particular person can be in one category with respect to particular domain and in the other with respect to another domain thus have seen professors in mathematics who were obviously perfection oriented with respect to mathematics be firmly in the performance oriented category with respect to the efficient use of say word processors it is almost surrealistic experience to see person in one situation full of intellectual curiosity and wanting to know everything about everything and in another situation argue why you should not use particular method that he himself does not know anything about for reasons that are obviously totally artificial

hr is inherently since it abridges the first amendment freedom of speech sections and anticipate that and state how the constitution would be amended to make hr no longer sec expedited consideration of constitutional amendment and sec constitutional amendment described hr says in order to run you are required to pay for your campaign from public fund in order qualify to collect from that fund you have to demonstrate certain degree of popularity by either achieving certain standing in the previous elections or by completing an unlikely to succeed petition since it will be very difficult for any but the two established parties to meet the requirement needed to collect from the public find third parties will not be able to run at all since they cannot use funding from other sources therefore it would effectively enforce two party system comprising the democrats and gop only technically third party could run but the reality is there would be an overwhelming barrier to entry without third party running in my case the libertarians have no way to express my views during the election process and therefore it is violation of my first amendment right to freedom of speech have no proof but my gut tells me the reason democrats are sponsoring this legislation is because some many of them blame rapher nader for splitting some democrats off to vote for him thereby costing the democrats the election

communism and fascism go hand in hand though so no big surpise there is absolutely right in that ultimately they are both forms of totalitarian governments people obsess over politics in left right dichotomy or socialism capitalism axis however the important axis is freedom slavery or anarchy political power is zero sum game for every power granted to government the people lose freedom it doesn matter if the people consider themselves to be better off as result or not the fact remains freedom is lost every time the government is given the power to enforce rule very few people are willing to admit they prefer being slaves to the state but the fact is most people do prefer it most people prefer having portion their earnings forceably taken away in return for roads schools fire departments etc some would argue they are not slaves but the fact is slave is given certain things by his master things which are actually the result of the slave labor in return for protection by the master depending on the master some slaves are given certain freedoms such as where to work or who to marry but ultimately the power resides in the master being able to choose your master is not the same thing as being free from master some would say the constitution protects americans from being slaves by guaranteeing our freedoms and would say the founding fathers did good job of trying to make us as free as possible life liberty and the pursuit of happiness combined with the statement that all rights not herein enunmerated are retained by the states and the people should have covered it pretty clearly however the current interpretations of the general welfare clause and the interstate commerce clause along with certain amendments like the income tax have stripped us of the freedom we fought for and claimed over years ago the reason most people are willing to accept state of slavery is because they have no faith in their neighbors they believe that their neighbors will not voluntarily contribute to the neighborhood well being and must therefore be forced by the way those contributions are not necessarily financial they can be things like not being racist or any other behavior typically deemed beneficial by the government which often uses the tax code to enact social engineering the loss of freedom by americans is what is leading directly to the decline and fall of america the sort of ideal nation that used to come to mind when the word america was used is not possible when the citizens are slaves as slaves are poor building material europeans are no different at the end of the day as people are people everywhere you go europe followed different path and as result has reached slightly different destination more socialist but the important result is the same we have all traded our freedom for mere material well being

also if you do put in the time learn new awesome technology such as lisp or latex or how to configure your window manager you are instantly biased towards that technology sometimes to the point where any time savings you feel are completely bogus as an example many years ago spent the time to learn how to configure fvwm it took me couple of days but then got it setup exactly the way wanted had sloppyfocus but also set it up so that the various gadgets such as oclock never got focus had root terminals get bright red frame as warning could use the mouse wheel to quickly roll up windows to get them out of my way shift arrow would shift between windows much faster than the windows like default and honestly believed that was being really productive it called psychological commitment the effort spent doing stuff like this has to be justified somehow another perhaps less obvious example is the unix shell when you master the unix command line you are being really efficient certainly you are much more productive than the slow gui tools right because you can write stuff like for in find amp png grep sed tr do autofoo end rm png and have all your images automatically scaled cropped and mailed to your grandmother in mere minutes every unix user knows how efficient the shell is but every unix user also knows what happens if you type rm png instead of rm png the time required to repair such an incident is not accounted for when unix wizards report how much more efficient they are that psychological commitment again they blame themselves not the tool for the time eventhough the mistake could not happen in windows the time spent learning the arcane language has to be justified and the easiest way in this case is to say oh screwed up that was my fault not because unix is crap guess what saying is just that there are solid reasons to be suspicious of zealots trying to make you use their awesome new toy

sorry my agreement with you that there is no difference between the two parties in system dominated by two parties slipped out of my reply you are absolutely right as to democrats and republicans fighting to the death over piddling differences both parties are adept at the use of psychology to create stong sense of identity in their members rather like sports fans as result it is more important to the members to be perceived as good party member than to be good american or brit or whatever
the important thing is to write beg borrow steal the scheduler and rpc bit once and abstract it away from your application code which usually means you invent limited language for describing jobs just like sql is limited language for describing queries there nothing inherent in sql that confines it to one process concurrency means you have to give up knowing exactly when amp in what order sub operations take place if you do join between million row tables and slap where clause on it the query planner is free to do the clauses in whatever order it thinks will be faster talking about reads amp calculation right now things without side effects like render farm or search engine job failure can be handled by re execution or dumping etc so much for reads the real complexity comes when people try to implement transactional systems over many machines say hugemongous blog comment site or multiplayer game with thousands of magic arrows flying about at first look it seems impossible how the fuck do we maintain consistent state mostly you don an individual user does not interact with the world as whole only with her local frame the story she commenting on the dragon that chewing her arm off etc so one way is to design it like you would large tennis tournament line judge and two players go off amp do their thing and you compile the results as they come back instead of some every sparrow falls global judge you have simple conversations that are run independently and recorded after the fact usng simple conversations the banking system does it this way amp they seem to do all right that why it work to figure out someone present net worth it not some number floating over their heads it static slice of dynamic process and it will never be exact on http labs google com papers they describe three layered systems gfs mapreduce and sawzall gfs is clustered fileysytem mapreduce is job system sawzall is an sql like language that uses both to accomplish amazing things with very simple programs

nice article although the author writes that there hasn been any noticeable suppression of labor here are couple thoughts on the bush administration suppression of organized labor first when the dept of homeland security was created all the employees were forced to leave their unions in order to provide bush with more flexibility second secretary of education ron brown made an infamous comment where he referred to the nea the teacher union as terrorist organization think our government probably meets this criterion too

while on the surface this has the appearance of someone not paying for insurance and thus not getting coverage this is really far more broken for things like basic public safety that everybody depends on society should cover everyone and incorporate the costs into taxes since it is in everyone interest to have this protection and there is no reasonable justification that someone should be allowed to opt out this is something like everyone having to choose to pay voluntary fee for police protection and if they do not crimes against them are ignored that the bureaucrats couldn figure out how to incorporate the fees into property taxes like they do virtually everywhere else in this country and instead left situation where fires could potentially burn down someone property without coverage is positively dystopian can see how from libertarian point of view this situation is acceptable which is why the more extreme libertarians irritate me their ideas don even sound reasonable in theory let alone practice

what great reply think that many people are willing to accept state of slavery because of lack of faith in themselves rather than their neighbours you have to have something that you want to do with your freedom but when you do you ll not give it up for anything in the world
guess it hasn because even my macromedia flash plugin is performing illegal operations now
quick tip if you dropped out of college to start business don quote this statistic to your friends still in college it will only make them feel bad about themselves and engender ill will towards you
thank you you re very kind agree that lack of self confidence is contributing factor to the average person desire to accept state of slavery in the past whenever have discussed personal freedom with people the objection hear more than any other goes something like this this is all good for you and me but what about that guy he can handle freedom like we can as result concluded lack of faith in their neighbor is the main cause in the acceptance of state of slavery however the more think about it the more think you may be onto something definitely going to have to ponder on it for while in the meantime ll observe that the social safety net enables us to ignore our neighbor and for him to ignore us this is very useful to politicians who want to divide and conquer it nefarious the politicians take our money to create safety net which enables us to ignore our neighbors which divides us and makes us easier for those same politicians to manipulate in effect we re lambs being led to slaughter plus we re paying for the knife and butcher worse yet many of us have been convinced we got the better end of the deal
kinda cool but the overlay is off and ruins the effect

agreed they re hardly the only ones in government and even big business that do this of course it just that it convenient for the source of this story to perpetuate the view that these guys are luddites because they work for what is falsely perceived as luddite administration so they rely on lesser forms of communication that aren time sinks and do not require them to carry blackberrys think this is true of most people who travel lot and are constantly on the move even if this discussion were limited only to the tech world ask yourself this question how much time do you think steve jobs spends answering email every day my guess would be less than writers for msnbc do

not so sure that we are anywhere close to resurgence of the labor movement certainly right now unions and unionized businesses are doing exceptionally poorly in the us on larger scale it seems that countries that are more unionized have recently tended to do poorly in comparison to the less unionized ones it is possible that unions were transient something that was necessary because there was still so much friction in the economic system and that they are no longer needed further walmart is not treating people as chattels chattel is slave or bit of personal property as far as know associates are free to quit whenever they want they don get paid much but what they do is not that hard and does not require much in the way of qualifications so it is not surprising that it is poorly compensated

yes chattel slavery seems to contradict capitalism in the abstract which is more about wage slavery ve heard that large component of the civil war was the clash between these two models though unfortunately know little about the war beyond what learned in school which was largely dry recitation of the military aspects and irrelevant political speeches however wal mart simply receives too much corporate welfare to justifiably say love it or leave it they frequently gain grants for building new stores on the promise of increasing employment tax breaks despite using local state government resources pushing off employee medical costs onto governments and so forth and if we re talking about capitalism in the abstract the notion of corporation seems to be distortion of capitalism they tend to have greater human rights than normal humans so when someone says the employee is free to start their own wal mart beater that seems to misunderstand capitalism adam smith even explained the unlikelihood of wage employee saving enough capital to start their own business much less wal mart which of course tries to kick away any ladder that new competitors attempt to climb behind them it often nader and libertarians who seem to campaign for small business not the mainstream politicians

yeah on both sides so that not really an argument biking can make men sterile on which there also no utterly robust data since it long term that doesn mean the tour de france shouldn exist the it like juming down whole lot gt it worse for women than for men thing is just weird true you can intuitively argue things either way that have no necessary semblance to reality but google gave me cbs article and in fact for women this could have serious affect on the uterus and abdomen or so doctors thought until recently of course putting these things on has to make economic sense if only half dozen are serious competitors as suggested then it not necessarily good investment if you want to split the men and women events it wouldn hurt to use the same course for an hour or two more especially with olympics when it there anyway don think olympic organizers should decide they know better than the dozens of sports organisations that make this simply sport practiced by women things they re not responsible for decisions about whether you should allow someone to take possible risk there are what at least half dozen of extreme sports that pose more risk to men and women alike than this to women

perhaps rule to see if links are equal for example different google video links could point to the same video but differ based on the query string perhaps reddit could ignore any part of google video url the disadvatage of this is that it would have to be hard coded for google video and repeated for many urls

what this supposed to mean
ok so if go to clapton would save the that would have spent on dylan in my book that is in my pocket if stupid enough to be willing to pay more for something than its market value how can use that as the basis for computing an opportunity cost maybe should stick to engineering
so long as they are small or you can disable them
explaination the purpose of reddit is to find new things online right some times people will post in the comments links that are similar to the current story my suggested similar links would allow anyone to attach link links to story when you view the info on the link it would show some of the links suggested perhaps about the links shown would be randomly choosen or at least have high random factor to prevent group think this is different from the detect duplicates http features reddit com info id oy suggestion this is for similar links that is for identical links this would also improve the recommendation system
how to detect duplicates page can have several urls and the content may differ due to ads for example first step may be to strip the mark up then you can measure the string edit distance levenshtein distance http en wikipedia org wiki to all other existing entries if the distance is sufficiently small you assume that the pages are identical however there are some problems with this approach the computation would be very expensive compute distance number of entries and you need the full text of all documents therefore better approach might be to use some clustering technique clustering http en wikipedia org wiki data_clustering the process goes roughly like this extract some features from the text word frequencies and use them to position the document in vector space the idea is now that if you already have an entry for this document you would find its corresponding vector exactly at the place of the new vector or really close to it this solves both above mentioned problems the complexity doesn depend on the number of entries anymore and you don need the full text of all documents but only the vectors the first one isn obvious you may argue that you have to compare vector to all other vectors to determine whether there is vector close enough but there exist some smart tricks to prevent that
just like many economists not an economist so hope someone corrects any mistakes in my explanation my understanding is that an opportunity cost http en wikipedia org wiki is the net value of the next best alternative to what you re currently considering what is the net value of watching dylan value you dylanticket cost you dylanticket the value of the ticket is relative to you the you in the problem your value of it approaches subtract the cost which ticketmaster or some market sets at and you re left with of value from the transaction what is the net value of clapton value you claptonticket cost you claptonticket the question doesn specify how much you value the clapton ticket let say you value it less than dylan ticket so that it approaches fortunately the purchase cost is so the net value is of course this all assumes you have some weird value function which maps your internal social benefits from music concerts into dollars squishy science this economics seems and think one job of advertising is to mess with this function

yeah reddit ought to put limit on that if was testing the system make sure somebody couldn specify kb or worse yet mb of text as the subject
modded this down as being little too specific modded programming up however
it the very purpose of reddit to filter the noise and it seems to work pretty well so don see why one should want to bypass the general voting procedure the only argument that would support your proposal would be proof showing that really good stories don make it on reddit but this would as well be the proof that the whole reddit system doesn work what is good story would say that one of the main assumptions of reddit is that story is by definition good if it gets high scores and that it bad otherwise under this assumption your problem actually doesn exist if this assumption doesn hold reddit is flawed

think it would be much more democratic no to do that this could polarize the news of reddit to the interests of the most active users if new user submits great content think it shouldn be in disadvantage in comparison to something submitted by an active user unless one wants to break the democratic editorial system which seems to work fine until now
lot of dupes could be eliminated without looking at the text at all just computing edit distance on the url and title is enough in many cases digg seems to do something like this

this one an excellent argument for itself
the kid is eight years old it way too late to start cutting off bits his mother doesn like now this should have been done approximately years ago
as others have suggested it would be nice to see stories that were selected by blending the algorithms hot new and top for example top means the top stories regardless of age which can be thought of as top new then there the new section which is like the newest stories regardless of score like to be able to say want the top stories that are at least kinda new and so on the most natural ui for this seems to be dragbar like google maps uses to zoom in
it would be nice to see list of the top people with tastes most similar to mine so that could see what they upvoted an additional perk on the what they upvoted page would be way to filter out the links already saw so could see here bunch of stuff that you haven seen before but other people like you liked guess it like the recommended page but with more transparency
take look at lussumo vanilla interface for this the private messages are embedded in the conversation http getvanilla com

same could be done for recommended you then have space of weighting for stories triangle with corners labeled top new and recommended would allow you to select what weighting what is hot now would be top new recommended etc

hm you are right but how to deal with cases like the following http server com story id amp style classic http server com story id amp style classic http server com story id the distance between the first two is smaller than the distance between the second and the third do you mean the title of the reddit entry or of the linked document itself the titles of the reddit entries vary lot for duplicates but maybe the content of the title tag of the document combined with the edit distance of the urls could do it in many cases but again calculating the edit distances for maybe urls isn done in second
gnome
unlike other satelite photos where they take pictures of the entire surface of the earth at once
have subreddit tab on the front page which is drag over drop down so you can select the subreddit of your choice
this is cool like googles zeitgeist http www server com story style classic and we wouldn have to see ancient articles by paul graham on top of the list all the time
it would be useful even if it just suggested this story might already have been submitted without having to be sure on the equality of the urls think lot of times submitting the same story twice is accidental so if when you submitted url if reddit thought it was dup it could show the form again with message saying we think it dup to this other story
on one page pointed this tool at it picked up two obscure colors defined in the css and ignored the main page colors such as the body background color and nav bar background color
it community driven website and it the community that will notice these things and it the community that will prevent it from happening sure someone might get brief karma boost by doing this on regular basis but after few submissions the regular visitors will wise up and punish them with their votes that how it works

is this really so uninteresting that it needs to be modded to negative numbers
exactly the problem with the top page is it increasingly difficult for new links to make it to the front page the links that are already there still gain votes and the other top voted pages lie somewhere pages back links on the hot page are lucky to stay visible for days that leaves huge gap of visibility between the hot page and the top page for links that are highly voted but don have the points needed to beat out paul grahm
this would be nice right now it seems like the clicking on user only shows their submissions comments etc for that sub reddit it would be better to have single user profile page that somehow divides between sections or maybe not that having to hand edit the url to go from features reddit com user foobar to http reddit com user foobar

originally thought that voting up down story was whether you liked it and would want it to be more popular in one comment somewhere pg stated that voting was really just way to train filter on what reddit should show you get the feeling that there are reddit features missing would really like to better train my reddit to ignore links that are just submissions of joel pg guy blog posts and understanding how voting influences what is recommended would be helpful

tags have there place but not here
or you have an option in the prefs that determines what the save button will do
it seems like reddit has mostly avoided categories or tags so far but instead of having requests for new subreddits which will likely be programming politics etc why not allow story submitter choose category that would make it simple to have politics reddit com without needing whole seperate reddit to browse to before you submit story and even if politics reddit com was created using the request for subreddit plenty of political stories will appear on the normal reddit seems like having system to optionally choose category would make it easy to break up subreddits think tags would make it more fragmented which is why suggest reddit defining the top level categories

miles is only just over kilometres which is stone throw with couple of skips at the end as far as nukes are concerned so wonder what exactly this means pakistan has some very low yield nuclear warheads such that it okay to have your own guys standing miles from ground zero because there won be much fallout to worry about pakistan considers its soldiers and missile techs to be mostly expendable cannon fodder and they re the only ones who ll ever worry about the fallout pakistan considers its borders to be so close together and any possible theatres of combat so small that long range capacity would be superfluous anyway or pakistan thinks the prevailing wind patterns are such that the fallout would always land on india anyway hmm hmm edit the title actually wrong this thing range is only kilometres less than miles it not quite nuclear slingshot but it not much better than nuclear bazooka either ll have to consider one last alternative namely the pakistanis are stark staring lunatic

being able to vote links up and down is big part of what makes reddit different think the same system would work well for elections have found myself in the position of voting for candidate dislike just because that the only practical way to vote against candidate really hate bidirectional approval voting would give me way to vote against candidate explicitly without having to vote for anyone don like it also has the advantage of allowing multiple positive votes allowing the voter to express several preferences
better than simple plurality plurality voting is very heavily biased toward two party system whereas approval voting at least gives third parties chance can you tell disgruntled libertarian
so we can raise awareness that this guy is an idiot never mind apparently reddit people don get that sort of subtlety point taken
don think that negative campaigning is necessarily bad thing it just more information about the candidate which you can verify on your own not that people generally do think it would be great if campaigns were all negative people would start to realize that every vote is for the lesser of two evils and maybe start to look at alternatives to government

such system wouldn make big difference in elections like usa where only parties compete but in elections where there are or more parties this would allow to draw off parties getting relatively many votes but that everybody else hate remember reading somewhere that at his time hitler was elected by only about one third of voices but as with these votes he had more than any other party he was elected chancelor with reddit like vote maybe the other of the population would have voted against nazis who would have never come to power

what found strange is that there is no mention of the opportunities for the activities it seems to me that if there is dylan concert tomorrow for that changes everything is it really enough to say that would be willing to pay what if dylan concerts normally cost is it even meaningful to say that dylan concert is worth to me since this presumes would go to it if could buy tickets for and there were no other big opportunity costs ha ha so it must be worth somewhat more than so guess what didn like was making the problem real world enough that you thought more about it rather than keeping it strictly clean and theoretical which the concept seems to require since the concept seems to be an that only has limited utility

don know about the quality of the opportunity cost question but their answer to the monty hall problem is wrong the question as stated does not provide enough information to come to definite conclusion their answer partly addresses this by stating that monty knows what is behind each door that should have been stated in the question right but the answer even with this assumption is still incomplete not only do we need to know what information monty knows but also his intention if he intends for you to loose he would have only given the chance to switch in the case that you had chosen correctly the first time if he wants you to win he will only give you chance to choose again if had chosen incorrectly the first time if he doesn care if you win or lose it matters both that he knows the correct door and that he intentionly uncovers door that he knows is incorrect what are the odds that monty wants you to win who knows perhaps it depends on how many sponsored prizes have already been won in this show
so what exactly is the web movement as an ideology it is based upon series of ethical assumptions about media culture and technology it worships the creative amateur the self taught filmmaker the dorm room musician the unpublished writer it suggests that everyone even the most poorly educated and inarticulate amongst us can and should use digital media to express and realize themselves um sonds like the plain ol internet to me and get profound sense of irony from this article were it not for the internet reducing the barriers to entry andrew keen might have very tough time getting published
what you suggested might be better but what wrote was grammatical clear and punctuated as helpfully as any written english sentence might be it was not more difficult to read than it had to be your observation was an aesthetic one and not one about function consider however the sentence however the underlying idea that most economists are clueless still stands for real economics take look at the austrian school most convincingly at mises org when reading the word for many readers will assume that it is there as conjunction in the sense of since or believe when in fact it is preposition certainly we can all get used to doing this kind of deciphering but if standard orthography works better why mess with it or why not learn it anyhow it only seems like trend because ve been encountering it more learned about avoiding run on sentences in nd grade at school called john curtis christian school in new orleans where all that anyone seemed to care about was football maybe they just don teach this kind of thing anymore

simple approval voting vote for everyone you like and don vote for those you dislike would result in the same outcome for all elections the disapprove vote is implied with the absence of approval there is no reason to complicate the lives of voting officials volunteers of mixed mathematical background any more than is necessary personally think condorcet voting is far more elegant when there multiple candidates to choose from both in the expression of opinion and the method of vote counting you don need computer unlike irv if you always include none of the above option rank your approved candidates in the order of preference then rank the none of the above vote higher than those you disapprove of slightly more complicated than simple approval voting but worth it imho

well to be fair removing the female clitoris is more similar to removing the entire male glans the foreskin and the entire part of the penis normally covered by the foreskin in that sense female circumcision is really grossly misnamed in way that might make it seem less brutal than it is more exact female equivalent of male circumcision would be removing just the clitoral hood that too would be pointless and unnecessary operation but if that was all that was done doubt too many people would be upset about it
completely agree with you that good punctuation makes things easier to read all for it the reason looked for an error in your sentence was that there law forget its name that states that anyone who corrects someone grammar on an online forum will make at least one mistake of their own it amusing to see how often it holds true it usually does perhaps in times

in some ways irv is actually worse than plurality for example irv is pretty much the only well known voting system that fails the monotonicity criterion it is possible to cause winning candidate to lose by ranking him higher and to cause losing candidate to win by ranking him lower condorcet method is probably better than irv for single seat elections it uses the same ranked ballots as irv it also eliminates spoilers but it is more resistant to tactical voting and is easier to count http en wikipedia org wiki voting_systems http en wikipedia org wiki irv criteria_failed http en wikipedia org wiki schulze_method popular condorcet method

believe in reddit it the most addictive website ve encountered and the core technology could probably be applied to lots of other subject areas like politics consider investing if there were way to do so not sure the owners would benefit from selling stock though they seem to be doing fine with what resources they have and probably don want outsiders exerting influence on how they run their business
think some subreddits are good idea in particular it might be wise to separate politics from technology news but one thing like about reddit is that it has become one stop shopping for all my finding cool shit online needs if you create lots of subreddits it compromises that convenience
on second thought lots of subreddits would be fine if there were way to get the mathematical union of the subreddits that want to read maybe list of subreddits in the preference section with checkboxes to select the ones want to read
circumcision is thought to discourage masturbation really has that ever worked on anyone
sad only took my semester of microeconomics for people who do not care about economics but even got that one right
subreddits are pages like features reddit com or sub reddit com where there are list of links that can be voted up or down each with comments page don suggest each have it own subdomain though
lt insert disclaimer about not supporting embassy burnings etc here gt you have to put in consideration who published the cartoons before you can make conclusion about the purpose people outside scandinavia may not know that denmark has mayor upswing in anti immigration laws recently denmark is at the moment one of europe most racist countries and jyllands posten is denmark most racist news paper when you consider that then the cartoons seems little more than just an expression of free speech or fight against religious submission think the muslims around the world got the message loud and clear as it was intended denmark and most notably jyllands posten doesn like muslims second newspaper in europe to publish the cartoons was christian news paper in norway cartoons have null to do free speech its all about religion and the fact that in general muslims and christians don like each other
guess you could allow it until someone had either voted or followed your link kind of like how in pinball you get another ball if you immediately sink

calling jp racistic news paper is well at best uninformed jp is serious news paper in fact of the danish news papers it is the one with the highest sales numbers on daily basis
that something like too always being surprised by the variety of topics that come up creating separate subreddits in subdomains seems to be somewhat awkward way of doing categorization leads to fragmentation and navigation difficulties that don really need to be there though it makes sense for nsfw might be better to have limited set of tags approved by the redditmasters and let the submitter optionally choose one or two for each post then the reader can just browse through everything or choose to filter by subset or union of tags new tag requests can always be added in the request section

reminds me of quote found on lisp discussion board while back if find the link again ll post it it went something like this lisp is better than sex know year old me gave up many opportunities for sex to hack on her lisp macros
was just about to quote that exact sentence when saw your comment he could not have put this more eloquenty just hoping nobody tries to pull theo van gogh on him in the words of the somali born dutch politician ayaan hirsi ali the integration of muslims into european societies has been sped up by years due to the cartoons perhaps we do not need to fight the battle for the enlightenment all over again in europe
wonder what chaitin thinks about that
only the first time after that people would start throwing their disapproval votes at the lesser parties with which they conflict in canada the green party probably stands to benefit the most since no one would actually cast negative vote against the meanwhile the new democrats would be completely buried since nearly every conservative voter would also cast negative on the ndp
when politician says his opponent is mistaken that straightforward criticism but when he attacks statement as divisive or racially insensitive instead of arguing that it false we should start paying attention that paul graham in what you can say http www paulgraham com say html when read essays like that get the impression that it will be no challenge for me to apply these ideas in day to day life at the time they seem to follow so naturally from the thread of his argument but in the muddy confusion of multifaceted issues such as this one it becomes lot more difficult to hold to such principles than it seems for example it turns out you can just label them as racists and assume that scores some sort of point in the end it is important to defend everybody right to publish such cartoons without fear of reprisal that their motivations in doing so are disagreeable to you is irrelevant besides isn it obvious that the vast majority of the enraged muslims don give hoot about the history of jyllands posten
it would seem that hierarchy of tags would be best so if say arc was released tomorrow it should be here and in graham and in lisp

maybe my post was bit unclear don say that jp did not have the right to publish the cartoons of course they have the right to publish them and do so without any fear of reprisal and of course the muslims reaction is totally of proportion but can still believe this and think that jp was wrong in publishing the cartoons you say that the motivation for publishing is irrelevant disagree think that the motivation for the initial publishing is indeed interesting it is to simplify the story to make it just about free speech and religious submission

irv is pretty much the only well known voting system that fails the monotonicity criterion it is possible to cause winning candidate to lose by ranking him higher and to cause losing candidate to win by ranking him lower understand how similar situation can arise for example if you prefer candidate to candidate to candidate it possible that if you list them as first second and last you will cause to win whereas would have won had you listed him them instead of however don see how what you said cause winning candidate to lose by ranking him higher is possible could you please give an example
no recent studies have found the opposite to be true but it was common opinion in the late to mid when routine circumcision became popular
when posting comments mean almost every time that ve edited one of my comments it because lt gt did this lt gt instead of doing this
agree that condorcet and approval voting both seem better than instant runoff which is in turn better than majority rules however for some reason political activist groups have gotten behind irv and not the others is it only because it easier to understand
sure smaller parties would eventually get hit with their share of disapproval votes for example would vote against any candidate associted with the national socialist white people party american nazi party or constitution party conservative christian think the net effect would be to encourage very mild government and think most of the time less government is better

not sure failing monotonicity is that big deal voting systems are good if they produce fair outcomes for particular set of votes though counter intuitive the circumstances that cause irv to fail monotonicity are rare and involve close elections anyway the biggest problem with condorcet to my mind is its biggest feature that is selecting compromise candidates often the least objectionable candidate simply wasn scrutinized closely enough
think this would be good start eventually like to see reddit style bidirectional approval voting http reddit com info id used for elections not especially optimistic about either one ever being put in to use in the us though the major parties aren likely to support it

wow thanks for that label there landercut you almost sound as if you actually know what you re writing about labelling jyllands posten or denmark as whole as racist is not only generalising it also ignorant but never the less perfect example of the image that some people would like to stamp upon us making up this huge conflict between muslims and christians in denmark which in essence exists only in the media jyllands posten may be right wing newspaper but if you had bothered reading this letter or even the original article with which these cartoons were originally printed or look up the cases that sparked it you would with bit of luck given your attitude get that this isn to do with anything racist racist seriously look up the definition for that word but has perfectly legal point to it but guess it so much easier to point your finger and pout so much for understanding and dialogue

worst part of current voting is that you have to buy an all in one package of opinions that supposing that the voters are smart enough to build consistent system of thoughs for themselves and many voters with many individually consistent political views will when melted carelessly by any voting system let emerge consistent political line that would be somehow representative of them is part of democraties dogma but like many religious dogmae facts tend to prove it wrong notice that being wrong is not incompatible with being something the layman should believe seems grossly wrong to me so does it for irv proponents as well it seems since they insist on having one person party getting absolute majority of seats now not pretending that political parties address this issue adequately even less than us style bipartisan system does but strongly doubt that partyless system would do better don forget the main feature of democracy is not that it chooses the best candidate it quite obviously doesn its main purpose is that it ensures that grossly abusive rulers will get fired which is of course extremely valuable although it sometimes takes too much times

this seems pointless to me the author says he is motivated to show people that something other than windows exists guess why people don know there is something other than windows because they don give shit people want to play the new games and watch porn not fiddle around adding nonfree repositories to their package manager sources list so they can download the codecs required to watch movies linux user but only because the benefits none of which would be apparent to user who doesn use their machine primarily for data mining writing programs of computer users outweigh the annoyances changing the desktop background and making the task bar look different which is what booting into knoppix means to the average windows user isn going to convince anybody of anything

the group of people that is only interested in the olympics or only interested in politics doubt that these groups really exist like reddit exactly because it makes me stumble across stuff would never have looked for exactly because it serves my manifold interests
this could be solution but isn it reddits simplicity and straight forwardness what makes its appeal it common phenomenon especially in the open source world that people always try to improve things and completely miss the point when something is perfect many nice projects fail because people can stop adding improvements until the project is ruined altogether and it always much easier to bloat something than to de bloat it afterwards
working recommended feature would make most of the subreddits unnecessary except the meta reddits if not interested in politics the filter will learn that there are some quite nice implementations of such filters on the web and it no secret how to do such things indeed the problem seems to be relative of the spam filtering problem which has been very well studied

suspect it because irv is easier to understand it may be perceived as the most politically acceptable alternative to first past the post here in the usa agree that there are theoretically better ones and personally actually like to see single winner voting deprecated in favour of multi party parliamentary system but know won get that in my lifetime irv for all its flaws might perhaps see some minor use in the sometime reasonably soon
it not really clear from the article the other main example they cite which is the theorem about the classification of finite simple groups was not done by computer it huge theorem involving many special cases proved by many people over about hundred years but so far as know there were no computers involved anywhere the theorem is very big and so hard to verify in that sense but it hardly typical example and don think would have pointed to it as demonstration that mathematical proofs are getting harder to verify it not at all clear that this theorem is part of trend insofar is it unique

seems like this would be more useful at the local state level than the federal level guess that if even under approval voting the dems republicans would still split the federal races without any rd party candidates getting enough votes to win seats perhaps at the local state level there is less voting strictly along party lines that said all for considering anything that would improve the electoral situation in the be happy to start with congressional districts that are drawn up by independent panels aimed at improving competiveness like in iowa having the winners decide the rules seems like it will ensure more elections like where of the incumbents in the house were re elected

interesting php sends out http php net header but according to the article this ought to have been from the article it is interesting that prg pattern exploits non standard behavior of browsers and web servers http defines several redirect response codes in xx range some of these codes require browser to use the same request type some require to change post to get some require to obtain user confirmation when request is redirected turns out that many of these requirements are not implemented by popular browsers instead they have common de facto behavior like redirecting post to get without confirmation if received code this feature is used by prg pattern this behavior is wrong for found code but is absolutely correct for see other code still few servers return when redirect with get method is required httpresponse sendredirect method does not allow to set response code it always returns it is possible to emulate sendredirect url behavior using the following methods res setstatus res sc_see_other res setheader location url where sc_see_other is the proper code but sendredirect provides some additional service like resolving relative addresses so this is not direct snap in the discrepancy between browser behavior and http standard can be resolved if and codes considered equal and another code for proper behavior were created in any case doubt that browser vendors will change implementation of response code because too many applications relay on it the good thing is that modern browsers understand and correctly process code so if you want to be sure return instead of

it along the lines of not being able to shout fire in crowded theatre but its way down that line does his speech incite riot does it cause clear and present danger these questions lead to our time place and manner restrictions in the us regulation needs to be content neutral and narrowly tailored this whole paragraph is full of oftenquoted words when discussing freedom of speech and they all spawn from the fire example do not think it is fair to say that the fire quote excuses these kind of limitations on freedom of speech do understand that the holocaust is very touchy subject in europe and when visited concentration camp was myself overwhelmed with feeling the quote on one of the monuments that was translated for me said something to the effect we must never forget and each generation must work to remember so that such attrocities can never happen again in my opinion the only way people are going to forget is if they can talk or argue about it

gt you are not supporting free speech when you say that the man has no right to say something hateful and false because for all you know he might have unearthed some evidence that the holocaust didnt happen now as extremely unlikely as that may be he should still be allowed to express himself and we should all be allowed to express ourselves back firstly the fact that the holocaust happened is indisputable but if you want to discuss the wider principle of free speech you need to consider that irving was not convicted for saying something that people disagree with but because he broke well known specific law which carries sentence of up to years there fundamental difference there presumably you don think that the austrians should let people get away with breaking their laws
just cheep recruiting trap were do send my resume again

no he comparing hamas to hitler you are the one who brought up mandela who was marxist and whose wife did kidnap and torture people but that side issue and doesn bring him to the level of hitler or hamas meanwhile all of hamas leaders have either called for or actually participated in the murder of innocent women and children and are looking for the opportunity to do it again are you saying mandela is comparable to hamas

the author quotes eddington recounting an old argument that if the velocity of gravity were merely lt gt lt gt gravitational orbits would be unstable found this interesting so on the way home stopped at the library and fetched the book he quotes from the lt gt very next sentence lt gt in the book is the argument is fallacious because the effect of propagation will not necessarily be that is attracted in the direection towards that the web page author fails to include this sentence suggests willful deception and screams crank to me
it wasn an insinuation it was an extension of your logic to reveal the absurdity of your position if you think it is dumb to say that the holocaust is indisputable you are saying that it is therefore function of intelligence to question the holocaust the comment about the north pole was addressing your geocentric universe it was an example of situation where applying the scientific method is grossly inappropriate perhaps even dogmatic
of course yelling fire is just one of the many forms of speech which are prohibited for good reason used it as an example because it is clear and because holocaust denial is obviously inflammatory more like lighting fire in certain situations as it is an analogy it obviously might not hold up to certain kinds of ultra literal comparison holocaust denial is in its own class after all gt support free speech which includes holocaust denial and other forms of racist nonsense every society has some limitations on freedom of speech ranging from child porn to slander to nda this is about protection of rights not suppression
first irving is despicable and his theories are rubbish michael shermer of the skeptic magazine has written some very succient rebuttals of irving as well as has taken look at their mindset http www google com search michael shermer david irving lastly this is pathetic first freedom of speech is exactly for offensive speech mocking religion printing pornography blowing whistles and yes saying plainly disgusting things such as denying the holocaust this is simply so as bland inoffensive speech needs no defense strategically this is bad move this will give irving great audience to preach to all the prisoners he will be exposed to give him martyr status set of slippery slope for more prohibitions on free speech and with the timing coinciding with the muhammed cartoons you can more than bet that this will also mean creating laws against insulting islam effectively implementing parts of sharia in the west

wasn so thrilled with the article think may people are skeptical about the stockmarket look at those nice merril lynch convictions ceos the media look at fox and economists ability to predict certainly am of course at some point you have to make decisions and get on with your life so you can question everything for economics think that the weather is good analogy exactness is difficult and only remotely possible for the short term climate it will be warm in summer and rain more in april is easier and think that what more policy decisions are based on of course almost everyone also has their own agenda which needs to be factored in for example governments almost always predict more growth than independent economists unless they want to justify cutting something in any case still find lack of religious skepticism more dangerous because religion some forms yadda yadda represents an entire mode of thought faith over rationality and empiricism and that can have deadly consequences in all manner of endeavors
there will be no second holocaust is there some reason to exclude the genocide in rwanda what about cambodia
what intellegence got to do with it you didn say disputing the holocaust is stupid statement which wouldn have got much argument on reddit you said paraphrased disputing the holocaust is impossible
it not that disagree with austria upholding it laws its that disagree with them making laws to curtail free speech even if it is to silence such odious ideas as holocaust denial
link jacks link jacks roly poly linkjacked
you re missing the point it dumb to say anything is indisputable as counter example to your claim that the holocaust is indisputable in david irving disputed it in my belief he was factually incorrect in disputing it as there is an overwhelming amount of evidence that supports belief in the holocaust but he still disputed it
how do excess payments work click here to find out
great stuff
child porn is another bad example the laws against child porn are there because the production of child porn involves the abuse of children if david irving had been abusing children there would be no debate here

pretty cool guide
funnily enough when he sued someone for libel and lost in there was little evidence that he had recanted his views my own opinion he nasty evil shitty little man who deserves to be in prison just for being himself and he did break the law in austria whether there should be laws in austria banning holocaust denial is moot point note that lots of countries have laws along similar lines germany france etc this was only years ago
must say never thought be so fascinated by an article on detergents
perhaps you should read the article carter points out that although winning parliamentary majority hamas actually lack an majority due to some of their representatives being in prison and details other constitutional arrangements that would limit their effective power this is mainly due to the position of president abbas who has said that he will not appoint prime minister that does not accept the legitimacy of israel and the roadmap don think carter was pleased with hamas success rather he accepting the situation as having occured and suggesting what appears to be very intelligent approach to dealing with it the alternative is to stick your head in the sand bury the peace process and have an automatic escalation in violence

don think you should have to own trademark to get domain saying that if someone already owns the trademark registrars shouldn sell the domain to someone else in fact the law for coms is already that you can have arbitration to get domain from someone else if you already had the trademark and they re in violation of it however it be nice if registrars would do the due diligence of checking that upfront mean what exactly are we paying them for

think javascript is much more better designed than python even if of course it lacks lot of stuff because the application domain limited its evolution in some way and actually the words of the javascript creator are the trick then becomes not borrowing too much from python just enough to gain the essential benefits structured value generating continuations and general iteration protocol don think the guy who did design like javascript can really like the python philosophy too much and is just getting some idea needed from javascript from python but python in turn grabbed this idea from other languages

okay can sorta understand the outrage at the fact that one company and an unpopular one at that would control all com registrations however disagree that the prices should follow the more general internet trend of decreasing while the internet infrastructure is increasing in both bandwidth and capacity the amount of com domains available for purchase is quickly shrinking in other words the supply for com domains is decreasing while the demand is increasing speaking strictly economically the vendors should increase their prices the fact that they haven has lead to unofficial vendors who resell domains for higher prices namely domain squatters like it or not domain squatters exist because of the current fixed low price domain model that is in place today don have solution for you but arguing for continued low prices certainly isn one
think this article is well intensioned and all but don think it very well thought out although the author seems to admit this anyway the type of content produced under this business model would be extremely high spec and so therefore ensuring that our hardware companies then sell more high spec hardware right which means every new film coming out this year would require intel or apple latest innovative new media hardware which would effectively prevent you from playing that new media on last year hardware which is in effect kind of drm where people aren restricted by sophisticated encryption software but by having last year obsolete hardware gadgets but it doesn stop there apple would hypothetically then put in measures to stop apple content from being played on intel hardware and viz viz which brings us back to drm only now our content is under the control of much bigger times bigger and much more powerfull industry who doesn really care about so much as and then intel would invent skynet to manage all that new drm and we all be toast this is warning

many countries in europe legaly ban nazi speech and symbols at least france and germany do france especially is known to take legal actions against internet companies including ebay amazon yahoo and google in order to enforce these laws preventing the access of french users to the mein kampf book or auctions with nazi items banning sites from the search index to me this is no different from the chinese internet censorship but most people are not really that sensitive to freedom of speech issues when it doesn concern their own views some old articles about nazi related censorship in the internet http www internetnews com bus news article php http news zdnet co uk software htm there are things you can say in the western culture it is just silly to deny that and claim freedom of speech is absolute for us
believe me can understand the feeling behind all this the danger comes from the absoluteness of it you aim to get rid of that kind of hatred for anyone but it being done through ham fisted laws which is the first step to state sponsored hatred accept that austria amp other countries which actively participated probably should have these laws as proof of repentance but worry when something is so absolute but let me suggest different way to reduce hatred think of person you hate ask yourself honestly what can learn from this person make the effort to do so you may end up still despising him but blind hatred is harder once at party there was man who started confiding in me his belief that they were taking over by breeding faster than us and mixing breeds his mistake was am one of them and am quite proud of being mixed threw him out of my house much later realized my mistake had indulged in blind hate still would throw him out but should have made the effort to understand where he got such stupid ideas and maybe tried to show him different

agree with you real child porn doesn apply here though photoshopped child porn does not involve the abuse of children and is also illegal each of these limitations are in their own class the point being that freedom of speech can not be applied in formulaic way and there are widely recognised exceptions
grab society by the lapels and evangelize the importance of studying computer science how out of touch can person be maybe it time to outsource his job
and yet the us also has prohibitions on certain forms of free speech say the fact that the us courts haven yet recognised it as form of defamation is more an indication of shortcoming of the us legal system rather than an example of how the rest of the world should behave
the point is the fact that hamas does not have anything near complete control means that to have power they will have to make compromises with more moderate people in coalition in the parliament and also with abbas carter sees as an opportunity for hamas to become more moderate themselves which is good thing just look at the improvements in northern ireland with regard to the moderation of sinn fein ira

everyone citing google particular formula as if its the one true way to form an internet company is starting to drive me up wall lets take look at some of their basic design principals gt pages load instantly well these are nice but these are simply goals to aim for instead of requirements for success can think of many sites that went through severe growing pains while continuing to increase their userbase gt placement in search results is never sold to anyone well thats ok at least we can argree that aol is no one gt it best to do one thing really really well this is great advice about of the time but in general it has been proven to be wrong some of the best sites are successful because they combine common services together in an effective way for example the new networking sites ms http myspace com fb http facebook com etc craigs list for god sake google itself now combines mail chat search newsgroups and more in very profitable way then under gt you can make money without doing evil it just talks about targeted advertising non relavent advertisements are all that is evil give me break to cover themselves though they finally admit that their formula itself isn all that useful ve quoted it all below gt full disclosure update when we first wrote these things four years ago we included the phrase google does not do horoscopes financial advice or chat over time we ve expanded our view of the range of services we can offer web search for instance isn the only way for people to access or use information and products that then seemed unlikely are now key aspects of our portfolio this doesn mean we ve changed our core mission just that the farther we travel toward achieving it the more those blurry objects on the horizon come into sharper focus to be replaced of course by more blurry objects now not trying to tear apart every piece of their cute little values list but is anyone does anyone else see this as nothing more than marketing tool

well obviously you do anything that isn prohibited by the laws of physics or an empty wallet etc one meaning of the word indisputable is beyond doubt and would say this applies to the holocaust given the evidence we have it would certainly meet historian burden of proof if you say that it dumb to say anything is indisputable you are also saying that it intelligent to question everything with no differentiation

as an evolutionary biology student ve been wondering at what point ll be thrown out of the us for denying creationism but always thought be safe in europe at least in america most college students believe in evolution from what can tell and the creationists are crazy guys trying to find way to get religion into the government google the wedge this story implies that in the uk it the college students who are leading the charge scary
there were many other examples given and the point was made that they are all quite distinctive the argument was that there are socially accepted limitations to freedom of speech around the world not that holocaust denial is strictly analogous to anything else

if you are right then why aren students clamoring to major in computer science as recent computer engineering cs grad my immediate response was outsourcing and know my fellow classmates would likely agree later the author is on the money and acknowledges my fear and aren all the programming jobs being shipped overseas however never again in the article does he come back to that concern quite frankly the author not addressing outsourcing is case in point there is no fix for what should be booming field if no one will hire you oh and for real world example the only job could get is doing corporate it hell outhouse
gt although of course have not said the above no it was reply to robbie gt many great minds throughout known history agree with the statement so great minds throughout history think you should question everything without differentiation like some kind of automaton guess learning and judgement are no part of intelligence guess you really will need to go to the north pole to know for sure that it cold gt stop putting words in my mouth clearly you are of the opinion that one must either staunchly support the agrandization of the holocaust or be holocaust denier black amp white with us or against us et al aggrandization of the holocaust all ever did was simple reductio ad absurdum of your own argument can help it if you don like your own views

they need to make clear to lesson planners that creationism and evolution are not on equal footing one is religious belief based on the words of profets hundreds of years ago while the other is scientific deduction based on facts by even mentioning creationism in classrooms as one person in the article said they did you are giving students the wrong impression

what that reddit is making its way into the pr business well we ll let it slide this time think that this is great way for allowing the general public those that don have connections in tech startups to get foot in the only similar event can think of was google http code google com summerofcode html surely there have been others the advantage of combinator event over google is that people get to start their own projects instead of being forced to work on someone else this allows for much more motivational return for those involved and allows for more efficient use of time for those that can make good use of the additional creative flexibility somehow though know that many of the best applicants will be buried in the mountains of quality of applications screeners being able to determine so little about the applicant himself from an application myself will admit to having fired off an application while ago and yet no one ever visited the demo url included pr working little too well guys so that leads to the question is there way to expand great events like this without diluting their value perhaps the main challenge is financing since this is startup school when do you expect financial assistance from wealthy alumni in the end the value of this program to all of those that didn get in will be motivational this may be all that some groups need but for those that really need funding because they have product thats months from really becoming profitable is there anywhere else that one can look most alternatives weigh heavily on traditional factors such as school grades yet it appears that many of the most successful felt no need to excel in these areas and no borrowing money for summer job is not an option for any student know at any rate this looks like good event

the problem is mostly one of consumer loyalty most people are more loyal to entertainment brands stars like brad pitt directors like peter jackson characters like shrek sometimes studios like pixar than they are to technology brands that because entertainment brands are emotionally appealing most people don choose one movie over another because of price or usually because it distributed by one company or another they want to see the latest film that has their favorite star in it or that was directed by their favorite director or in more recent trend that is based on their favorite video game or book or tv show could intel or some other tech company buy the rights to some of these brands hire some independent filmmakers to make film versions of video games they managed to option the rights on etc maybe but the riaa members still control virtually all of the properties that are worth anything today unless the tech companies make serious committment to buying and developing entertainment properties for the long haul people will be afraid to work with them remember that most people who work in the entertainment business move around between companies and projects every few years but someone who goes to do project for intel may have to rely on intel good fortune and good graces forever since everyone in the business will know that they were in bed with the enemy and will be loathe to touch them hollywood didn get where it is by playing fair it will fight dirty to keep tight hold on its top properties
the problem is that everyone who questions certain aspects of evo theory gets lumped together with creationists and id ers there are some questioning from more scientific basis questions need to be asked in order to hone the theory to continue to improve it if we start taking dogmatic stance on evolution then we re as bad as the creationists and id ers aren we

don worry you re plenty safe with your evolutionary beliefs in both us and european universities where darwinism reigns supreme it bit alarmist to suggest that evolution is in any danger of losing it grip at this point however if you question evolutionary theory even if you re not creationist or id er in any way you ll experience all kinds of discrimination if you re grad student you won get funding and if you re phd or post doc you re not gonna get position with the uni lot of focus has been on the creationist id ers but really there are others of us out here who are questioning from more scientific standpoint not that we want to throw out the whole theory but there are some rather problematic bits

quite frankly the author not addressing outsourcing is case in point there is no fix for what should be booming field if no one will hire you but if you re willing to work for peanuts there lots of fun to be had seriously though in order to do make software dev your career in the us at this point you have to be willing to live with lot of uncertainty there no such thing as permanent job anymore though there probably never really was we were able to live with the illusion though you also have to be willing to live on lot less than you would have in the past these things aren all bad think the uncertainty now is spurring lot of software developers to go ahead and take the risk of starting their own companies though it kind of hard to buy house or car on credit when you can point to consistent income stream and you don know if you ll have consistent income stream one two or five years from now still people are realizing that working for corporation is really no more secure than working for yourself people are more willing to take the plunge and that should lead to lot of innovation which isn possible in the big corporate environment

students drop because the weed out classes are tough they think that the field is too mathematical automata theory it is not and sometimes have hard time understanding complex software and complex programming languages anything with pointers so your average college student won be attracted to it second the big money in cs is coming from graduate training implementing complex statistical algorithms aka an enterprise bayesian spam filter ok so not so complicated but it requires different ways of thinking statistical algorithmic performance complex systems for unix or linux to produce working system not many people get this training so big money follows bigger ideas in fact colleges need to start training people to think in these areas dunno but wasn exposed to statistics or linear algebra until graduate school and went to top cs undergrad institution most with pre aptitude for computers stick with it as the xbox generation matures think more people will enter cs in general

there is certain amount of dogmatism about evolution in some places and id will probably exacerbate that don think that the biggest problem though in my opinon the biggest problem is that there are so many people who don really understand the difference between physical theories of causation or potential histories of causation and metaphysical claims of absolute truth
neh not convinced that there is that large or unusual backlash against modifications to darwinian evolution within the community punctuated equilibria for instance are necessary modification to evolutionary theory in order to explain certain phenomena scientists have always had their pet theories that lead to disregard for evidence and dogmatism but that far cry from the claims the creationists make have yet to hear an id proponent admit that the only scientifically valid form of id involves alien life seeding our planet
yes my university offers plethora of different computing related degrees with various levels of emphasis on theory in what supposedly the most theory oriented of them but still feel like spend too much of my time learning how to maintain other peoples java programs for just that reason now doubling in mathematics
exactly the only problem is that there are many many people who think that their favorite claim of divinely revealed absolute truth is far more certain to be true than any mere man made theory to them your argument is completely backwards in my opinion the single biggest problem is that most people do not understand the problems with claims to absolute truth

in general you can figure it out by looking at the size thickness of the struts where they alter is where the join occurred for example in the fourth last image you can see the thickness of the twisty bar get larger and larger until the upper right join then it is small again so right there you can see how the join was created the second image is simlar in that case there are two joins because of the complexity of the object one behind the horizontal strut the back bar does not actually touch the horizontal bar and another somewhere in the top arch can tell where it quite masterful feat of paper sculpting

ok finally have to comment on what has bothered me for years in euclidian space what is time travel relative to the surface of our planet is spinning at mph it is orbiting sol at mph we live on spiral galaxy so it too is turning and god only knows what our galaxy is doing in relationship to it neighbors near and far just the surface travel at the equator after one second time jump either way would put you feet from where you started which would hang you in air or embed you in stone
just because you can see similarity doesn mean there isn one the interesting characteristic of algorithms in this case is not that they may or may not terminate but that they are powerful way of describing processes the interesting hypothesis is that you can describe or simulate an economy with an algorithm better than you can describe it with anything else it interesting because that would be useful and it might be true algorithms are much more flexible and powerful way of doing it than mathematical equations which was the best thing going until modern computers if you didn get that you pretty much missed the entire point of the paper

the good news is that maher arar was released and returned to canada in october http en wikipedia org wiki maher_arar the link also gives some reasons as to why the us and probably canada suspected arar was linked to al qaeda during stopover at jfk airport he was detained by united states immigration officials they claimed that arar was an associate of abdullah almalki syrian born ottawa man whom they suspected of having links to the al qaeda terror organization and they therefore suspected arar of being an al qaeda member himself when arar protested that he only had casual relationship with almalki having once worked with almalki brother at an ottawa high tech firm the officials produced copy of arar rental lease which almalki had co signed the fact that us officials had canadian document in their possession was later widely interpreted as evidence of the participation by canadian authorities in arar detention

the thing is that for the cost of fab intel could just outright buy the entire film library of most any movie studio what are the rights to all of the movies released last year worth fair bit mostly from dvd sales but hell of lot less than if intel offered to buy the rights of every movie released before by single major studio they could probably get it for on the order of if they purchased everything but the very most expensive properties everything that is presently making approximately money for content companies essentially they could do it for lot less let the content guys keep star wars james bond and handful of other big ticket properties and try to make money on them take the rest and make it free if you are intel and doing this drives people to buy more chips it would be pretty big win the same thing applies with apple and ipods they should just go and buy few record labels and let that music be free at least on itunes it would drive adoption like crazy bet
think that according to our or at least present understanding of physics in order to travel through time you would need to find an area of space time that loops back on itself wormhole and travel through it if you did this you wouldn disappear and then reappear you would just move in different direction through time relative to your desired start and end points note this is based on very non detailed ie amateur understanding of the possibility of real time travel as informed by this book how to build time machine http www amazon com gp product sr qid ref pd_bbs_ fencoding utf

liked this article because it provides evidence against few of the myths espoused either explicitly or implicitly by evolutionist that belief in evolution is relevant to the ability to do good science that smart people don believe in creationism and that there is no debate between evolution and creationism when approximately half of science students believe in creationism it hard to dismiss it as simply the beliefs of dumbasses although some are still trying see comment by annoymous_hater

this is my view on the situation posted this the same reply at the original article but wanted to post here as well for some feedback quote the big paradox is that the computer science revolution is just unfolding chazelle said why then are students are running away from it why is there this decline when the field has never been more exciting paradox is only paradox as long as you don have new model that incorporates both of the seemingly opposite phenomena the reason is freedom or lack of it there are different classes of programmers there are the guys that find computer science challenging and fun to do but follow the dogma of cs of the time then there are the people who see what others can the people who think to themselves why are they doing things this way isn it obvious to them it better to do it this way the renegades the future einsteins of cs in way well these kinds of people will be the last to try to make living out of cs in the or japan why software patents even if they don realize it conciously the smart ones will feel correctly that the way the system is set up at the moment will punish exploring the undiscovered country of computer science it will punish the brilliant minds with anxiety and fear because anything they discover will either be taken away from them or sued out of existence by the big players with their huge patent portfolios let me ask you question do you think the explorers that first colonized america would have gone forth into the wild west if they had rubber band attached to their wagon that would yank them back as soon as they found some prime piece of land to colonize rubber band held onto by the old money of europe that they were running away from or would einstein have gone into physics if anything he came up with would be attributed to his idiot colleagues colleagues who would then block any newer discoveries if they even remotely resembled what einstein came up with einstein would realize that he would be working against discovering even newer revelations by coming up with the intervening steps of discovery catch dictatorship of knowledge something similar exists today in the us and japan today early programmers learn that there is bad pattern of programming called spaghetti code it pattern of programming that creates seemingly invisible connections in your computer code that will create unforseen consequences that will crash your program it almost impossible to debug using the human mind so the early programmers correctly said fuck this this system is obviously flawed instead of trying to figure this out it better to completely scrap the system and create new one new programming language that prevents spaghetti code in the first place well guess what people who see the invisible people who have the potential to become the new einstein of cs see that any program he she creates is automatically spaghetti coded automatically hooked automatically rubber banded to the big corporations by law by software patent law any program anyone writes will always have couple of algorithms that are patented that just the nature of programming anything the programmer creates can be taken away by corporation that gets greedy or an attorney who wants to climb the corporate ladder why would genius who subconciously gets this automatically ever risk his livelyhood and maybe even risk the greater future discoveries of other explorers by going along with this system he or she will rightly say fuck this this system is obviously flawed instead of trying to figure way out of this problem it better to completely forget about programming and either go into law school or go to country which doesn have software patents yeah that it personal story the day heard that the european union was planning to introduce software patents felts physical terror knew it would destroy any future success lone programmer rogue explorer would be able to have in world where us corporations would say yeah it revolutionary program all right but eh you used scrollbar so you either sell your company to us or sue your program out of existence almost became religious after the programmers of europe and abroad united to defeat software patent law in front of logic and rationality the and japan better realize that they will either stunt the potential of their own future einsteins or suffer brain drain of brilliant programmers into europe where there still the freedom to explore and reap the benefits of their discoveries the more they try to keep their control over ideas into their hands and squeeze the more the good programmers will squeeze through their fingers wasn it mainly out of principle against total control that einstein fled to the us the world is run by greedy idiots swear to god hopes that solves the paradox and want to add that only idiots would need software patents to protect their livelihood if you take broader view and if you like to generally promote good hackers into computer science and gently dissuade lesser programmers to go into the field then as country you should do away with software patents the smarter ones will be able to stay ahead of the rest anyway and if you look at the reality of today software industry does google need software patents does microsoft even need software patents the only ones that are using software patents at the moment are the leeches of society if you really think algorithms are an expanded form of mathematics and that they are the future of science then you should lure the smart people in instead of punishing the einsteins with anxiety and stress for their insights of this spaghetti code of law

this is the socialist left variety of anarchy rather than the libertarian imagined wild west sort damn interesting never really expected working to some degree modern day example from either flavour edit worded that poorly don mean to suggest that somalia has special brand of anarchy that is incompatible with hypothetical libertarian societies mean that as an example of real world society that shows anarchy working this one is commune based not individual liberty based

every anarchist has different ideas but one camp is founded on community obligation in this case your clan the other is the freedom of every man for himself gt while clansmen are under no obligation to share their wealth with other clans they must share it to significant extent within the clan van notten notes this as drawback and states that the law makes clansmen somewhat prisoner of their clan that would have the libertarian variety anarchist spitting tacks they label it communism or theft only extreme libertarians want to get rid of government altogether

someone scratched the following message into one of the partitions between toilet stalles in the first floor mens room of the cs building at my university gt compsci is da bomb who the richest man in the world bitch the problem with cs is that it currently fighting with software engineering for funds and attention the two fields are orthogonal except for the first two years or so of undergraduate material so play it safe kids who want nice stable jobs and high grade point averages have to endure automata theory would be theoreticians have to learn code commenting standards oop and java which is to real programming language what toilet paper is to painter canvas this guy should be leading the charge to expel anyone who ever published on programmer productivity metrics from his discipline rather than whining about how nobody wants to go to school to study the art of filling out tps reports

quote computer science is the formalization of processes or imperative knowledge whereas math is the formalization of declarative knowledge people tend to confuse the essence of field with its tools does that mean that processes can only be described by imperative programming what about functional programming don they describe processes declaratively or is it that declarative algorithm is more of black box that will change the information that is input without adjusting the black box at all so that the way you structure the input is kind of the algorithm asking because want to start programming in functional language erlang thanks in advance

this reminds me of the sapir whorf theory the theory that language determines the way you structure your thoughts http en wikipedia org wiki sapir in linguistics the sapir whorf hypothesis swh states that there is systematic relationship between the grammatical categories of the language person speaks and how that person both understands the world and behaves in it this controversial hypothesis is named after the linguist and anthropologist edward sapir and his colleague and student benjamin whorf

gt does that mean that processes can only be described by gt imperative programming he one of the co authors of the best textbook ever written for cs structure and interpretation of computer programs which is also imo the best introduction to functional programming it uses purely functional programming for the first three chapters and stays mostly functional for the other two so he talking about functional languages too incidentally if you want to start functional programming would suggest learning scheme from sicp it will easily translate to erlang what he means is that he talking about processes that you can turn into something computer can do declarative knowledge just talks about facts about the world imperative knowledge talks about how to do stuff or find answers functional programming is way to tell computer how to do stuff it just isn imperative in the sense that it doesn use destructive state changing operations it doesn describe processes declaratively prolog on the other hand is declarative programming in prolog is entering facts and then telling the logic system to infer some consequences from those facts

find reading these articles about the dollar hegemony as if it was some sort of pyramid scheme the connection between one line of reasoning and the next is little unclear can someone please explain in well reasoned manner exactly how the choice of unit of account really is so important strategically to the us doubt that the link is there my own guess is that if the unit of account changes overnight to the euro it might create some short term illiquidities no pun intended but people will adapt quickly as the price of oil really is independent of the currency that it is quoted in which depends on supply and demand but am always open to thoughtful commentary

not my problem if you don care for my style or if rorty doesn conclude what you want didn say it would change anything let alone absolutely everything lots of idiots are attracted to lots of smart people thinking less of the smart people is pretty hasty generalization gave up arguing persuasively on the internets long time ago when realized most people already have their opinion formed won take the time to follow persuasive opinion anyway sorry if you are in the minority and you like me to spell everything out for you but won if you want to understand rorty you ll just have to read some if you don want to or just want to criticize everything around you go on ahead it is after all what do most of the time

nations don have rights most of the time when we say nation we mean government and any power the government has comes by violating the rights of the people this is very sad and infuriating example of what happens when government does not respect the rights of its citizens the us government was almost an exception to the rule that people in power will use that power to hurt others it just matter of degree and it getting worse what happened to arar is wrong no matter how you slice it

guess overall it is not that bad voice call for authorisation is kind of crappy it means that on the company side you seriously impact the duration of transaction and even how well you can scale on the client side it is kind of unfriendly to rely on voice for authorisation currently do transactions much more secure and instantanious without any of these also verbal transmission of pin information just itches me somewhere you have someone else who knows your pin unless you use some kind of ivr and someone can overhear you when you give it over the phone

the swh is one of those things that you know is kind of true but also kind of not in most cases it society that forms language rather than the other way around japan didn always have bucket load of polite ways to say things that only happened after the feudal age dragged on for too long in this case if we were doing cs right we probably talk about it right too probably changing our words is good first step on the path to right action though
find it interesting she and presumably the author of the book doesn mention the millions killed and find disingenuous to say that democracy caused the warlords somehow doubt they would have all sat around peacefully herding sheep had no attempt towards central government been made but cheap weapons were available would also be very curious as to the rights and roles of women and non warrior types and what about just coming from smaller weaker jilib the whole thing seems rather one sided and doesn jibe with the violence and fear that seems to be associated with such tribalism seen elsewhere in the world that said think imposing form of government on people who aren ready for it or don want it is doomed to failure measuring whether the people don want it is bit tricky since it involves taking some power away from those who have which is never happy proposition
these bikers don seem like your typical drug dealing motorcycle gang in fact would think such groups make up miniscule minority of bikers particularly with the influx of mid life crisis bikers just look at sturgis these days so the probability that its just pr stunt is pretty low and its little insulting to the bikers know who are good honest people think your conception of snoop dogg business as community destroying is similarly out of touch as is your need to qualify snoop as gansta particularly with scare quotes around it these are just stereotypes that the media uses to scare people and though they re good at getting people to listen to the local news or buy magazine they re not particularly true there no need to perpetuate them
persuasive opinion is by definition one that persuades people if you re not persuading others then you aren persuasive would say that you re right that arguing on the internet usually doesn result in people changing their opinion however it sometimes does read good piece by dennett on the role of religion in the public square and changed my opinion then thought about it some more and changed my opinion back still felt like learned something you made good point which recognized from rorty people tend to think that the things they re into are the absolute coolest things ever and everyone should love it his example was his love of bird watching or something like that ve read an accusation that paul graham is doing that when he says hackers are like painters anyhow that point was lost in your original message because you switched up ideas one after another with no follow up when you write you should give the reader enough rope to let them draw the conclusion that you re pushing on their own then give them the conclusion on silver platter in case they missed it firing off five interesting things with no obvious connection between them and hostile vibe isn really good way to get people onto your side try to step back and think about what you re arguing including all the mechanics that you prefer to skip over if you don explain things to the degree that it feels like too much to you it probably won be enough for the reader since they have their own minds and might not naturally follow an idea down the same path that you do

true it would be hard to hold one accountable for the iraq invasion on bush vote however functional accountability in the us democracy is more complex than the last vote cast public reaction guaged through press coverage lobbying efforts opinion polls and home district canvasing by elected officials and staff all serve to inform the professional politicians of the distance they had to move on the iraq thrust before risking involuntarily retirement unfortunately the shit news networks do better job of reminding the well washed masses of rag wearing insurgents and noble soldiers than the human beings unfortunate enough to find themselves caught up in that mess too bad we have too much priveledge and opportunity at our fingertips to plead innocence either majority of the electorate was too apathetic ignorant or supportive effectively the same thing during the buildup to war or we are not democracy

hoping this will become something of self correcting problem fewer graduates means more money and better job prospects for the ones who do study cs which will encourage more students this of course presumes that the number of jobs doesn shrink as fast as the number of graduates however think people are waking up to the fact that it not always the best idea to have someone from different culture in different timezone maybe speaking different language working on the core of your business and india is getting more expensive anyway as to the information theory side of cs vs the practical side think it healthy when the two are somewhat mixed with more emphasis on theoretical aspects at university ve been programming professionally for the last ten years now eep and definitely used some of my theoretical background directly and more indirectly in terms of how it affected my thinking but find it arrogant and misguided to completely ignore actually doing something that to me becomes like aristotle just sitting around imagining experiments rather than doing any and getting stuff wrong
damn right this is not about good or evil just people standing up for whatever they believe gangsta is term meaning social outlaw around the black community gangstas are not inherently bad they just have no where to turn and needed the money in fact if you ever bother to listen to gangsta rap cent doesnt count you will realize most of them are fighting against social inequality not agaist law and order snoop dogg is not even violent rapper his lyrics mostly concentrate on parties and women

sorry to disagree harshly but see disturbing trend in popular games to be less abstract and more concrete concrete in the sense that the games are realistic and there little room for interpretation can see why this is popular as with watching tv it is comforting to be able to take break from thinking math cs and games such as chess and even simple checkers and tic tac toe are all imo abstract in that these all okay some may argue about math only have value because we assign value to them in our minds to the uninitiated all look like rather silly wastes of time one ray of hope for me is the new trend in japan for old style more abstract games that just might provide the salvation you envision but for opposite reasons to be even more general just think people want to feel good the problem is that large parts of popular culture endorse feeling good now in the present at the expense of pain later the concrete games tv mcd and recreational drugs including alcohol are examples of this lifestyle at least when taken to extreme think it healthier to be willing to be accept little discomfort in the present in return for feeling good later examples are exercise practice the piano saving money helping others and even working toward cs degree now how to convince the next generation

at this moment for example in if it was oceania was at war with eurasia and in alliance with eastasia in no public or private utterance was it ever admitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along different lines actually as winston well knew it was only four years since oceania had been at war with eastasia and in alliance with eurasia but that was merely piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to possess because his memory was not satisfactorily under control officially the change of partners had never happened oceania was at war with eurasia therefore oceania had always been at war with eurasia the enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil and it followed that any past or future agreement with him was impossible

the laws would have to be narrowly defined and content neutral think they could get away with laws that restricted protesting private funeral as long as they made the law very specific so it could not expand to other venues just can believe how sick these people are thanking god that soldiers died because they were protecting country that harbored homosexuals this country being the same one they fucking live in this guy must have cult going on that said not sure if law is the best answer but these people are retarded
saying that linux sucks because you didn find ubuntu to your liking is like saying that motor vehicles suck because you had distasteful experience with ford focus but of course you must have known that before you posted you re relatively smart guy with decent grasp of logic and rhetoric you were just hoping for few inflammatory fanboy comments weren you funny that you ve unlinked comments on that post by the way griping about the default color scheme seriously you can tell me that you couldn figure out how to change that so congratulations one linux distribution down and only suse to go and mandriva and fedora debian mepis gentoo yoper and slackware and

perhaps if you had read the entry it would have made more sense if you think dealing with mostly invisible enemy is easy you don know anything about politics however the point of the article isn to praise bush for how he has handled the situation it is to comment on how he has attacked our liberties while claiming to help others gain them of course it always best to rush to judgement

you re assuming that those libraries are for sale at any reasonable price don think any of the major studios would sell anything that would really be worth having to tech company they re intangible assets which means they are effectively priceless if you sell fab you can always build newer better one if you sell the rights to old movies you might retain the right to do remakes and sequels but you can really replace the originals think the studios consider those to be core assets it would be like intel selling all of the chip designs they ever created or bought the equivalent to fab in the entertainment business would be more like set of sound stages with cameras and such not the content library

gt liked this article because it provides evidence against few of the myths espoused either explicitly or implicitly by evolutionist that belief in evolution is relevant to the ability to do good science that smart people don believe in creationism and that there is no debate between evolution and creationism good understanding of well established theories whether you believe them or not is relevant to the ability to do good science the problem with creationists is generally not that they disbelieve evolutionary theory but that their understanding of it is so unbelievably bad usually deliberately of course there are smart people who believe in creationism smart people often believe stupid things depends on how you define debate there are plenty of people who make all sorts of spurious claims about evolution blatantly misrepresent the theory and then use those strawman arguments to claim that they have vanquished it don call that debate but you might what exactly are the beliefs of those half of all science students you mention are they all biblical literalists young earth creationists or are significant portion of them creationists in that they generally believe that god designed the universe and life even if scientifically verified means like evolution and the big bang are the way he did it kind of big difference which is why those differences are generally glossed over by creationists

the reason why evolution is not believed by many thinking and competent people is that the only way we know of to produce complex machines is by intelligent design without the intervention of an an intelligent designer or process complex machines break down over time they do not evolve watch left to itself will eventually turn into pile of dust to believe the opposite that pile of dust will eventually turn into watch requires too much faith for many people living organisms are much more complex than watches why they should be more likely to form themselves from dust or soup than watches is unclear therefore the first reasonable explanation for the origin of life involves an intelligent creator to convince reasonable person otherwise requires lot of evidence about the power of random purposeless processes to create useful machines evidence which is not forthcoming from evolutionists in fact if anything biologists seem to be teaching that life is even more complex less likely to be produced without purpose than previously thought for example just recently learned about the toxoplasma parasite and its effect on rats the hand waving arguments of evolutionists on how this could have evolved just don seem credible the most reasonable explanation to me on how something like this could have come about involve devolution of toxoplasma toxoplasma started out with many more efects on rats but over time it lost most of these effects because of the natural process of degeneration until now all that remains is an effect on the rat fear response this explanation fits creationist model much better than an evolutionist model

thank you for writing this essay very deep and very fun to read have one or two comments taken from my own experience am young mathematician working in france about the prestige and the money you do as if they couldn be part of the fun why really love giving conferences or lectures at least when the audience doesn get lost or helping people around me colleagues that like but who are not necessarily friends my french notion may not be the same as yours by organizing seminar or something else now the prestige is part of the pleasure it good to feel you re helping people around you and to imagine this little image of you travelling in some places you ve never been and ii the more famous you are the more people you don know are likely to come to you and become people you know hope this last sentence was comprehensible about the money would first say as used to when was that it doesn matter that much now that pay my own holiday trips and try to invite my wife in nice restaurants would reconsider my answer you should not accept poor salary if you think you are doing great job you may take it if this is your best option at given moment but never give up finding better one as far as am concerned work better in nice flat with balcony than in some dark room lost in noisy area that costs money and what is more important is this think the money you get has something to do with the way the society acknowledges your work in other words poor salary means something like nobody cares for what you do of course you may know that this is untrue but after while this awful idea can contaminate you you gradually stop feeling productive and eventually lose your self confidence on the day your wife goes away for instance

gt that the only way we know of to produce complex machines is by intelligent design false very very false in fact the complex machine you re typing on right now was most likely not intelligently designed but rather had its circuits laid out using random variation plus selection its common misconception http www com onelap even among practicing engineers but don think it very excusable misconception the big difference between your watch and living organism is that life reproduces more than that it reproduces with variations and not all of the reproductions continue on living or reproducing themselves it hard to believe that with this issue you re truly thinking and competent when you make such huge errors in fact half wonder if you re just making up this post to rile people up don doubt that you are thinking and competent person on other issues but your interpretation of your religion has blinded you from the truth

the last thing we need to do is give phelps and his westboro church any more publicity than they deserve they are trolls of the real world and live for this kind of reaction phelps and his ilk are not true christians they can even be used as valid criticism of christianity so why is this the number one article on reddit
ahahaha no it the equivalent of saying lot of people buy soap used to think that people wanted sentient nuclear fusion powered robotic factories to clean themselves but was horribly horribly wrong now realize that value to the customer and difficulty complexity of engineering are completely different things of course web is still bubble but that because the software doesn provide much value not because it relatively easy to write my opinion not google and yahoo opinion and they have the mbillions and not_ and they paying out the millions my opinions so
agh those snobbish rebuttals made me cringe
please don confuse mr phelps utterly bizarre biblical interpretation if you can call it that with christianity phelps is nutcase who has no idea what christ actually taught to love your neighbor as yourself to care for the downtrodden and outcast etc phelps believes in his own mental construct of jesus not the jesus portrayed in the bible

what is this place becoming livejournal
then it seems to me he is slandering christianity by associating himself with the term and that the true christians ought to take him to task for it or maybe just need to tell you about the no true scotsman fallacy http en wikipedia org wiki

arrow up on slightly different track the whole idea of what it is that makes life meaningful and isn it tragic that no one is grieving for someone because they were loner and or didn accomplish much in life is kind of funny and ironic what does dead person gain from having thousand grieving friends what does dead person gain from having accomplished what they wanted to accomplish nothing absolutely nothing those are the concerns of living person there is not single dead person ever who gives rats ass about what they accomplished or how much of an unloved lonely person they were in life they literally could not care less there is absolutely no reason to feel sad for dead person ever they are not sad you can not feel empathy for dead person because they are not feeling anything at all because they do not exist any more you cannot empathize with that person might empathize with feeling of regret while one life flashes before one eyes but they are really just empathizing with their own unnecessary ruminations of course this is not about empathy this is about living person thinking about their own life and how horrible it would be if they died tomorrow without ever having asked that pretty girl to go out with them or without becoming doctor like they knew they could have if they would have applied themselves in college it living person projecting their own feelings about their own death on someone else because it too hard to think about it directly isn it so tragic they say while vowing to hurry up and live better lives what they forget is that tragedy is also concept of the living about the living that has nothing to do with the dead what they really don want to think about is that when they die they will cease to exist exactly like the person they are fervently wishing not to be like what they can not not_ admit is that when that happens every trace they left in the universe will begin to fade but they will no longer care because care is only for the living some day someone else will be the one to look at their corpse and think about them and will vow to hurry up and make something of their life in the end the only thing that lasts beyond the grave is the judgements of your successors the dead however do not care about what their successors think of them it is conversation of the living for the living the living may see accomplishment or tragedy but in the end it just way of trying to forget that the only thing they re playing for is something that they won care about when the buzzer sounds

from my link gt and how about those randomized place and route algorithms that have driven fpga design for over decade or ripup and retry autorouters for pc boards the use of random design variations coupled with fitness selection officially qualifies as non leading edge established routine methodology not the antithesis of engineering non intelligent design is sometimes used when complexity surpasses the interest of single mind in circuit layout as well as areas such as scheduling my phrasing was imprecise because obviously most of computer is designed by humans my point is that non intelligent systems handle complexity and complex machines well that we use such products all the time and that the watch argument has yet again proven to be the sophistry in the debate

tcl would have been an ideal choice to do what php does it very simple has great api writing apache modules for it has been very fun and pleasant experience and is very very robust code as it stands tcl perhaps suffers from some of the same problems php has for building really big systems but it far more universal language being equally suited to whipping up dynamic web pages creating gui with tk or testing networking equipment
you do agree with me small town life is more realised ethical community that is why it is good governments and corporations are almost self confessedly unethical they consider themselves above any law and act accordingly history repeatedly confirms this but it is the asymmetry of their dominance that allows them stronger more pervasive more even networks are good they help the kantian contradiction of unethical willing to be realised bad acts become actually self destructive and self suppressing

the cartoonist is mistaken it true that if you reduce your consumption of something others will consume bit more of it but not to the degree that you cut your consumption because of that and because the price is now slightly lower the suppliers are now making slightly less money after all if the people in developing countries are currently willing to buy more oil than they already are at the current price why aren they

the major shift in society is that there are more people who care less about ethics the net enables information sharing these multiply to increase shrinkage inventory that they should have but can find from these stores people game the system with fraudulent returns to wal mart and outright theft often sometimes inside jobs not to mention organized crime my googlefu is insufficient to find an article read about an fbi agent busting ring of thieves doing this kind of thing

yea and the majority response was well we all agree that its absolute but try and explain it to your significant other around anniversary time and see what happens
also do this at both of these stores especially fry they have cashiers but only one receipt guy just don have time for that they aren checking your receipt because they think you stole something they re checking it because they don trust their cashiers can tell because they re not checking my pockets only my bags out of respect for another person dignity ll let them glance at my receipt if there nobody else in line but if there even one person ahead of me just walk on by occasionally they get angry and say excuse me sir sir but by then everyone behind me has realized that they too don need to wait in this line and follow suit

http www pearceyreport com archives post_ php gt the heart of design theory is the claim that design can be empirically detected when you think about it this is something we do all the time in ordinary life we distinguish readily between the products of nature and the products of intelligence imagine you are walking on the beach admiring the lovely pattern of the ripples yet you know that ripples are nothing more than the effect of wind on waves gt gt then suppose you come across sand castle do you assume it was created by the wind and waves as well why not the material constituents of the castle are nothing but sand mud and water just like the ripples all around it but we intuitively recognize that those starting materials have different kind of order imposed upon them design theory merely formalizes this ordinary intuition gt gt critics say the concept of design does not belong in science but several areas of science already deal with the detection of design back in read newspaper headline announcing that astronomers may have discovered radio messages coming from outer space they dubbed the signals lgm to signify little green men later however they realized that the radio pulses were coming in regular recurring pattern like the flashing of lighthouse not an irregular pattern like the sequence of letters in message what they had discovered were not aliens but pulsars rotating stars gt gt today astronomers involved in the search for intelligence have worked out extensive criteria for recognizing if radio signal is an encoded message or if it is just natural phenomenon like pulsar in other words they have criteria for distinguishing between products of design and products of natural causes gt gt in the same way archeologists have worked out criteria for determining when stone has the distinctive chip marks of primitive tool design and when its shape is simply the result of weathering detectives are trained to distinguish murder design from death by natural causes insurance companies have steps for deciding whether fire was intentional case of arson design or just an accident cryptologists have procedures to determine whether set of symbols is secret message design or merely random sequence the point is that many branches of science already deal with the detection of design the claim of design theory is that it can be applied to nature as well
it would also point out that if you don like it don do business with companies like that and private land is not an island unto itself you go there to shop there is no implicit agreement that private store has the right to do that you purchased your goods unless they suspect you stole something and have more than its standard they can am fairly libertarian on lot of issues and don see how private land owner of the land can do what they want to you is true its business when you open your doors to anyone you give up lot of rights however if were club member of something like sams club thats fine me and sams have an agreement that either of us can cancel

http www pearceyreport com archives post_ php gt design the hallmark of design is an irregular sequence that fits prescribed pattern in shakespeare hamlet the letters are irregular they do not repeat the same pattern over and over as in the scrabble example the reason they function to communicate is that they fit the prescribed pattern of the english language the technical term for this is specified complexity and it the kind of order we see in books magazines and scrabble games gt gt the most popular analogy however is computer the dna molecule itself is the hardware and the message it stores and conveys is the software that why biologist richard dawkins can say the machine code of the genes is uncannily computer like apart from differences in jargon the pages of molecular biology journal might be interchanged with those of computer engineering journal

actually he right the point is that while you can reduce the consumption of oil you can decide what oil will no longer be consumed or what the oil producers no longer spend money on if less oil is consumed the oil no longer used will be the oil that is most expensive to pump and that just doesn happen to be oil from saudi arabia now admittedly the saudis are pumping at maximum capacity so if the price goes down they too will make slightly less money but that doesn meen they will give less to terrorists but rather to the thing least important to them they are still spending on that would more likely be school for girls then al kaida so if less money is spent on oil that doesn mean less money finds it way to the terrorists it means first less money for the marginal producer and second less money for whatever pleasure the saudi royal family considers marginal so you can use less oil but not less of the oil the al sauds use to fund osama
there is no real value of anything it all about how much people are willing to pay
do tonnes of php development and enjoy the language however would be thrilled to learn another language that could do the same thing but faster and easier have done fair bit of research to find that elusive language but have yet to find anything that has really convinced me it fits the bill the reason php is so good is because it gets the job done and know that when need to work on project on someone crappy month hosting server where don have shell access can compile binaries and does not have ruby installed php will work believe it or not develop some pretty indepth projects that use ajax and access some pretty hefty databases and don even know what cgi is all about it wasn until month ago that realized that am basically lamp developer except don know much about linux and don even know what apache really is but the fact is if you know mysql and php linux and apache will take care of the rest of it enlighten me if you think crackpot

thanks for the link one rubric of the id crowd is that randomness can result in anything that appears to be designed here typical statement to convince reasonable person otherwise requires lot of evidence about the power of random purposeless processes to create useful machines and another example the one was lambasting in the paragraph quoted above naturalistic evolution is the antithesis to engineering engineers understand that complex structures are intelligently designed not the product of random variations purposeless random process do produce interesting things mineral crystals snowflakes that might appear to some eyes to be intelligently designed but purposeful random processes are more interesting in biology the purpose is propagation those genes haplotypes species etc that are better at propagation given the constraints of the biologica system tend to be more successful combination of random variations and natural selection produce results that to some eyes look like design in the breeding of canines one can see the result of variations different matings of dogs and bitches combined with artificial selection according to fitness criteria determined by the breeder which quite apparently can be very different from natural selection criteria this process of random variations with fitness selection is an engineer design practice that has emerged over the last years and it pretty clever one once design reaches certain complexity it time to let the machines take over since machines are powerful but not intelligent different approach is taken let the machine make all sorts of random guesses about how to implement something and then test those candidate implementations against fitness criteria also knowns as design contraints in electronic circuit design the design generation machine is typically computer hw and sw the constraints are based on arbitrary design contraints set by designer in biology the design generation machine is dna the constraints are based on survival and propagation within biological system what differentiates dna from computer hw is the ability to reproduce for more on the topic of how evolutionary theory informs modern design practices http www eetimes com news latest showarticle jhtml articleid

one reason that they hate us is that we keep messing with their countries as the us government attempts to guarantee oil supply for our economy the history of the us relationship with iran is fascinating that way and the world had good series http theworld org worldfeature iran index shtml on it so once we stop depending on their oil maybe we ll stop propping up corrupt governments hussein in the and eventually good will might return

and to this end they built themselves stupendous super computer which was so amazingly intelligent that even before its data banks had been connected up it had started from think therefore am and got as far as deducing the existence of rice pudding and income tax before anyone managed to turn it off
actually fundamental to the discussion is an understanding of the nature of the diamond market it is monopoly with single organization throttling the supply of diamonds in the world the reason that diamonds deviate hugely from their real value is because there are no competitors to debeers but otherwise in most other areas where there is healthy competition the prices of items are close to their real values
it sounds like scott adams missed the first day of economics class where they discussed supply and demand when you buy car with better mileage you do your part to reduce demand for oil reducing demand means less oil gets sold and it gets sold for cheaper price so it does have some small effect on oil producers profits and if large number of people do it the effect could be dramatic
that why it should be separate it not convenient to have that page cluttered with subreddits that most people can read
gt the prices of items are close to their real values you don get it do you there no real value of anything humans place value on something by deciding how much to pay for it and whether to buy it or not this is not defence of debeer questionable tactics just fundamental economic principle have read of this http en wikipedia org wiki value_ economics

agree it seems natural to me that clicking on the title should take you to the subreddit your in that was how expected it to work before it did work that way but it is annoying that there no link to click back to the main reddit page don think changing the behaviour would work either if the title says features reddit then it should take me to the features reddit maybe link home could be added near the top of the page by the logo or by my username
it called documented source so and so said is not source learned in th grade journalism to have little more than bs to write story oh and then to finish it with an editorial opinion cheney reckless and drunken actions can talk to the public then any evidence that shows the vice president drunk as skunk will never see the light of day that called yellow journalism also one beer at noon drunk at dusk does not sound plausible no matter what heart drugs you are taking beer oh content lasts an hour max not hrs with physical activity oh but wait cheney had dui when he was teen yrs ago he must be always drunk also from what read it was the police who decided not to go to the ranch until the next morning imagine you shoot your good friend are freaking out go to the hospital which always takes forever even if you are the vp of the us and are dealing with contacting his family waiting for news etc it wasn like he went back to the ranch kicked up his feet and just brushed off the cops until the morning the media has gone nuts with this and shown us how ridiculous they can be it important to question your elected officials but it also important to question the media and realize when they ve gone too far
from the link that you posted in neoclassical economics the value of an object or service is often seen as nothing but the price it would bring in an open and competitive market this is determined primarily by the demand for the object relative to supply that is the notion of value that subscribe to as well thanks for the link

lt gt it has only recently become threat to natural diamonds as russian crafted synthetic diamonds of gem quality have permiated the market lt gt my point precisely so it does seem like there were no real competitors to debeers until recently
does this strike anyone else as expectable from this administration stop shoving the constitution in my face it just goddamn piece of paper those words may or may not have actually come out of bush mouth but he lives by them every day
so we are in agreement then diamonds have no real value other than what people will pay for them
think their aim is to have each subreddit represent smaller community instead of level of organization that could work out well for language subreddits and maybe for certain topics like the developers one mentioned in the reddit blog but maybe not for others like the winter olympics
had seen the documentary about the synthetic diamonds being produced cheaply in russia apparently the synthetic diamonds were more flawless than natural diamonds as per the documentary the debeers spin machine was busy trying to prove to people that the flaws were sign of it being natural and therefore desirable attribute for diamond lol

am neither in agreement nor disagreement my point was just that if the market were competitive then the price of diamonds would be closer to the value as per the definition that quoted imho your definition of value what people will pay for them is more appropriate in the field of something like say the art industry not all rare paintings are expensive but only those painters that people take fancy to are expensive but even in such situation if van gogh were able to paint million paintings in his lifetime the price for such paintings would be drastically lower than if they were rarer to obtain
http reddit com goto id
nobody is being fooled nobody disputes that its value on the street far exceeds it true rarity the point is that the value is not inherent in the item itself but rather placed upon it people were being fooled if they invested in diamond ring thinking it would turn out to be some grand return later in life when fact is that far more are held onto by their owners into death than pawned or sold yeah it would be nice if things didn work like this but it been the practice for numerous years it modern dowry in sense and that been sop for hell of long time it simply physical adjunct to an entirely abstract idea don see the commotion

find some of these reasons quite comical gt there are incompatible versions of php spoken as if your webserver runs all of them at the same time just about any language that has more than one version does something in later version that breaks some things that would work in previous version gt php character set support is so bad want to scratch my eyes out this is true but few people have need to parse non standard character set additionally lots of emerging web technologies had poor character set support until they realized that people who used other character sets would want to use their software most famously mysql gt string false int is true double equals will always try to convert the comparison to like types it works quite logically to me gt references are syntactically complex and implemented let be nice badly php solves some of this with incompatible change he complains it should work better then complains that in fixing it in php that it breaks what he said works badly in the first place gt php isn thread safe he provides perfectly reasonable work around in the text of the reply gt the quality of php compiled in libraries differs widely ok that means that there are some good libraries in my experience there are many the whole article is just rant as to how php sucked for his particular project coded in his particular style with the final assumption that it must be useless for everyone one has to remember php is the youngest of the popular scripting languages php was the first widely received public release in and really the zend engine the backend didn hit until php was released in for comparison python was in the early and perl was in it is certainly improving with each new releases and will continue to get better to add my personal arguement the syntax makes it great you can switch between java and php while still maintaining syntactic sanity and it not difficult for many current programmers to learn or decypher program written in it

people were being fooled if they invested in diamond ring thinking it would turn out to be some grand return later in life when fact is that far more are held onto by their owners into death than pawned or sold even if you conceded that tons of diamond engagement rings end up in pawn shops due to break ups and aren all worn for lifetime doesn diminish the force of your argument at all just because those pawned diamonds don have any value compared to when they were new rather not assume that pawned diamond indicates somebody was fooled it the law of diminishing returns at work rings are sentimental personal gifts and once the relationship ends people may not want to be reminded of the person the ring was meant to signify that doesn mean the same guy who pawned ring wouldn turn around and buy new diamond for new girlfriend years later it not matter of learning lesson but rather deciding that the value of the ring no matter what your view of the economics of the situation are is worth spending lot of money on if you want to pick up good quality cheap diamond look at pawn shops near military bases the closer the better but wouldn advise telling your beloved that you bought her ring at pawn broker any more than would advise telling her that the chanel bag you found for her came from thrift store that didn know any better the value of the item proceeds from its symbolic meaning linked to one woman and the perception that diamonds are rare and if hundreds of thousands of men in western countries spend large amounts of cash on squashed carbon that they know they ve been culturally conditioned to buy the monetary value of the item rises according to those market forces anyway know some women who don care where the diamond came from but other women consider that diamond can only be given once else the symbiosis will be meaningless to them even women who drive used cars or wear thrift store clothing admit it bizarre but who here can really say that they understand women anyway

while glad to see this too many abortions are done purely out of convenience pretty baffled with there not being an exception for rape victims is there an exception for cases where its either the mother or the child that dies anyway people are free to have their own opinions but when people are having abortions simply because they don want the child or they don have the money there is no excuse you really should ve thought of that before you decided to start practicing human action which has the side effect of producing human beings this day and age there plenty of people on adoption waiting lists that would gladly take your baby there just is no excuse for killing child purely out of convenience still there does need to be some type of exception for both rape victims and in cases where the mother can die in that case don think you can really give black and white answer and it comes down to the situation at hand

if you oppose abortion it presumably because you are of the opinion that abortion is murder if it murder how can you possibly justify killing human being just because his or her father committed criminal act what if that child were brought to term was born and developed into an adult would it be okay to kill him at years of age if not how can you advocate killing him in utero and still claim that fetus is human being

this whole discussion is kind of missing the point yes value is determined by humans but in most markets it also determined by how easy it is to get as noted in the link the value is the price it would bring in an open and competitive market in an open and competitive market diamonds would not bring very high price because they re very cheap to find and turn into jewels and so competitors would undercut one another until they reached price proportional to the cost of manufacture this think is what the other posters are intuitively thinking of when they say real value the reason that diamonds are so expensive is not that they re difficult to make or find but because de beers has closed the market to competition in this way that they cannot be undercut and that what illegitimate about the whole operation which is what elicits distaste from readers de beers mainly makes money not by providing desired product but by closing the market to competition
the question is larger than south dakota having the ability to bar abortions though it ironically comes back to the respective states ability to do so roe vs wade name most americans are familiar with was case where majority of the us supreme court held individual states can write laws preventing abortion since then the folks on the pro life side have attempted to challenge it every so often for the supreme court has reversed itself in the past it now has new conservative members net gain of inevitably the south dakota statute will be challenged in court before it goes into effect the big deal of it will be whether it makes its way up to the supreme court who with its new composition may possibly overturn the earlier roe decision this is unlikely since the court was sitting at against overturn and will now probably still be one short at if for some reason it is overturned the states will likely have the ability to make their own abortion laws and the literally poor girls who get knocked up in the wrong state will be getting dangerous procedures in back alleys again so there could be measurable impact

interesting comment on that page think the article kind of exaggerated bit agree with wazza above the patent only covers technology that enables creation of rich media apps using an online design tool which is pro fx it has nothing to do with ajax the article might be just riding the ajax wave ajax is very popular search keyword nowadays here the patent owner site http www profx us here the patent link http patft uspto gov netacgi nph parser sect pto amp sect hitoff amp pall amp amp netahtml srchnum htm amp amp amp amp wku amp os pn amp rs pn

summary world of warcraft is unlike street fighter expanded summary since everyone knows that talent is more important than hard work and that it better to tackle things on your own than work well with others world of warcraft is lame oh and it run by jerks knew was in trouble when saw the raph koster quote not that have anything against raph koster but do you really need to cite an authority figure already assumed this was going to be an opinion piece so let have your opinion already and it made it seem like he was endorsing the design of star wars galaxies over wow which is an equally tenuous argument disclaimer don play any mmorpgs just watch others who do
the story asserts that they have quantum computer that works by sending photon along paths that will be different for different runs except that because of mumble mumble quantum effects it all happens in one run and the probabilities associated with the effects along the various paths are how the answer is arrived at this believe it or not is the simple straightforward part the new result apparently is that they can prevent the photon from entering the multi pathed layout at all and get the same answer because apparently there some probability that it got in there anyway guess so the computer doesn actually operate in that there no photon supplied to it of course since they get the desired result the computer does operate in sense am not physicist of any kind and have only read various popular accounts of quantum computers so this might be all wrong
interesting stuff
satisfying read thank you

as of me reading this there are comments and not single mention of the word sex so be it overpaying for diamond is more often than not actually paying for the right to have sex with specific woman the value of that may very well be higher than the intrinsic value of the diamond whatever the semantics being happily married for years hereby declare that diamonds are for other people

apparently back when god created man he not only made sex outside of marriage possible but he also gave women sex drive so that some of them actually wanted to have sex and didn need marriage proposal to persuade them know didn believe it at first either but read it on the internet somewhere so it must be true of course it goes without saying that god ll strike down any woman who lets man touch her before he given her diamond ring mean that just common sense

try reading any patent without tears marring your vision for starters united states patent abstract method for inducing cats to exercise consists of directing beam of invisible light produced by hand held laser apparatus onto the floor or wall or other opaque surface in the vicinity of the cat then moving the laser so as to cause the bright pattern of light to move in an irregular way fascinating to cats and to any other animal with chase instinct

no there this pure php templating system called phpsavant having used spring webmvc and turbogears in the meantime can say this package does fine job separating view from controller and without having to add any barftastic special syntax to the php template considering as you say it already is templating language after you put variables into the template namespace using the tpl gt assign method they are available in the template using the standard object dereferencing prefix this gt that being said almost nobody in the php community uses phpsavant another reason why php sucks the community prefers the worst kind of hacks rather than elegant solutions that mirror the best of what going on with other languages
they missed out tetris though
use ruby web developer use lisp at home for my own projects but lisp is not viable choice for production work this is because of the lack of stable community canonical implementation and sparsity poor documentation instability of libraries ve been hanging around for long enough to know that these kind of claims always result in barage of counter arguments so knock yourselves out but just bear in mind don have an axe to grind about this love lisp and would use it if felt it was viable
it okay uses some depricated html though and like to be able to align the elements up properly they don seem to let you edit the css for the whole page anywhere and when click on the heading of the page the edit html button is off the screen meaning there no way can click on it unless set the screen resolution to be larger which can be bothered doing hotlinking seems to work okay for small files tried hotlinking mb swf and it didn load all the way though
it sad to see someone so bitterly fighting lost cause when are these guys just gonna realise they ve been beat and roll over and die particularly liked this for self delusion quota for the very casual consumer there are digital consumption models that will work when and if properly deployed yes itunes is that digital consumption model and it been very properly deployed it just that you didn deploy it people are using itunes because they like the ipod when dell which has scaled down its presence in the portable music market or samsung makes better device itunes will lose relevancy so when samsung makes better mp player plausible people will stop needing to buy music from itunes because they ll just rip it from their cds oh wait you can rip music from your cds because of braindamaged drm so how will we get music onto our snazzy samsung mp players the samsung music website it just pathetic
here thing about reddit that don really understand the story whose comments you re now reading has already been posted few days ago http reddit com info id and didn do too well points as of this writing this post now has points is it really just the title that does all the difference or was the other one posted at the wrong moment
found the co operation of wow to be crap there is no in game default voice chat feature thus you can only communicate via typing if you re typing you can do anything else so you can communicate well with other players in wow co operating is limited to not being dick people don play an instance dungeon together in reality group of people play beside each other and don intentionally screw each other over that not co operation
hitchens has repudiated his trotskyism people change their minds in the course of life you know although hitchens has just swung from one extreme to another

gt should be voting up for articles based on their quality think the writing is really really good or on the relevance the article was on topic interested in reddit faq seems to indicate the latter it all comes down to this does the recomendation engine work on keywords or by matching you up with other people like you feel like asking this question every day and never getting definitive answer
think the beat is as you say fairly simple but the sound of it is unique know that several people have tried to replicate it and definitely did not succeed
duh
so if after few more times you finally don want to do it again then you must have had good sex right

the arguments this guy makes are ludicruous people who enjoy the album experience are still likely to purchase an entire album however his accusation that itunes makes music disposable is unbelievably hypocritical when you consider that major record labels now focus almost completely on producing short term disposable artists is it any wonder that many consumers only buy singles on itunes when the recording industry has largely neglected the album experience for the last decade the idea of comparing the output of the latest manufactured pop idol to pablo picasso is hilarious gt the artist went into the studio and created body of work if you were buying painting from picasso would you have said look pablo like this painting man but only like that corner part with the tree and the guy finger how about you chop off that corner and give you instead of for the painting more apt comparison would be gt studio to artist look picasso you ve produced two good paintings however your contract requires that you now paint ten more quick knock offs to fill the walls of this gallery so that we can charge our customers more

if you actually read the patent you can see that the author of this main article really did not read the patent the patent itself mentions flash java and other rich media he has not been granted an article on rich media he basically wants to create flash content via web system instead of using flash builder on your own computer here is quote from the patent rich media productions are programmed and edited using powerful and complex tools designed for this purpose such productions are recent phenomenon to the internet and have only been made possible by the introduction of multimedia tools and technologies for the creation of high production internet content none of these multimedia tools and technologies however allows for the creation of rich media applications via the internet if you go to this website listed in the comment you can see that the patent owner is just trying to create flash content via the web not using software on your computer so this article is very inaccurate stop the hype demote this article

is anyone still trying to argue that patents are necessary to induce people to innovate they basically allow companies to sit on their laurels once they get patent instead of constantly competing to get ahead being first to market is already incentive enough there nothing stopping inventors from working for companies just like programmers do and can you imagine how much money gets wasted dealing with patents which could be avoided if they didn exist

no he right fake login screens are big threat to sites like these ms is particularly vulnerable in that you can overwrite whole profile page with your fake login using large position fixed table for example there are many ways alright here one example missing few parts here but look it up if you want to know first you put something like lt table border cellpadding cellspacing style position absolute left width height bgcolor gt lt td gt lt tr gt lt td gt lt tr gt lt table gt in the profile this covers the whole page with blank table you ll have to go into safe mode to submit it once you reach the page were you confirm the profile change you ll see that the submit button is covered due to the automatic preview to fix this you ll have to save the html of the page to your comp then edit the source and look for the form lt form method post action index cfm fuseaction profile amp mytok since the html page is now on your harddrive you ll have to make the action url an absolute address so the brower will know were to send the form data to do this just prepend http editprofile myspace com or whatever was in the url of the page originally to the action target thing in the quotes now to make it so you can see the submit button just delete the lt table stuff from the preview section in the file simple search should find it but its in the file twice be sure to remove the one that isn in quotes the one the browser will actually see open this page on your hd with your browser press submit there you ve overwritten your page with large blank table that blends in pretty well inside the table is were you put your fake myspace login some copy and pasting from the real thing should get you something that looks very close to the original luckily ms allows you to put any old forms in your profile so you should be in business since all this flexibility is key factor in the site success say that the vulnerability is simply the user susceptibility to the fishing attack

assuming the law actually reduced the abortion rate in south dakota think the crime rate would be lower after all the state would be minus at least two or three hundred murders annually heard somewhere that the lone abortion clinic in south dakota has about abortions each year
it not them it the bulk of patents the patent office only checks spelling not prior technology and leaves problems to be solved when things are challenged and believe most things that are challenged are indeed revoked but yes patents are archaic things this day and age
there should be no exception for rape victims because it does not make sense to justify another crime to repair the crime which has already been done and is irreversible for situations where the mother health is in danger the only legally permissible action should be for the doctor to relocate the developing child to some place either inside the mother body or outside the mother body where it can continue its development with reduced health impact to the mother and this should only be allowed when it is conclusive that mother would die if the child development were not interfered with understand that this usually results in the death of the child as we have no real means to guarantee that child can develop outside of mother body or even if it is to be relocated to another part of the mother body however we are talking about tough decision where doctor is usually deciding between one death and two deaths and the child death is an unintended double effect of the action to save the mother life
this is garbage they try to sell book on internet security it like having an adware that sells anti adware protection
we were discussing the latest article about why python is the greatest language ever conceived and felt like this connection like she was you know the one ve never felt this way about girl before she just gets me like no one else has ever done before think love her

don want to beat this subject to death but would like to think about what makes community it seems to me that community like developers is topic based community maybe not don know but suspect that most developers have interests that are larger subset of the general public interests than just programming and geekery know do comminities that can be identified by something other than topic make more sense to me language as we have seen also suggested that perhaps geographic location might be valid there are probably other ways to define commuinities that aren topic based too
you could just turn on the preference don show sites after ve disliked them err it seems that this is reddit com wide preference it would be nice if these preferences could be unique to each subreddit
bu arada bi arkadaş blogumda yorum yazmış neden türkçe reddit de reklam var da orjinalinde yok diye olayın sorumluluğu bana ait değil ben de bilmiyorum neden kendilerine sorun isterseniz diyorum ve sorumluluğu üzerimden atıyorum partner distribütör falan değilim yani sadece türkçe de olsun dedim
uh but you usually need recovery period after masterbation too
it would be nice to be able to have different preferences for each subreddit for instance on the subreddits subreddit like to be able to use don show sites after ve disliked them but don want that on the main reddit com page or any other subreddit

the author is making an imaginary distinction he presupposes incorrectly that life consists of one big choice work one ass off in stable boring dumb job in cubicle for money or not work very hard or not very disciplinedly in unstable interesting job outside cubicle for uncertain money this is not what happens in real life in real life the market demands many many services that do not involve sitting in cubicles many of these probably pay more for mildly enterprising mildly talented individual who is willing to work his or her ass off than cubicle jobs do

this is cop out used by people who don understand programming languages and their different features to avoid the problem of language design completely some languages are better than others you must must must agree that no one should ever code in brainfuck for anything that going to be useful to anyone this is an existence theorem for language being bad it is bad to use brainfuck because brainfuck lacks major features that are needed to aid linguistic abstraction this is why no one uses it literally everyone who knows how to program has used language more powerful than brainfuck and so they look at brainfuck and say how could you ever get anything done you don have lt feature gt where lt feature is usually named variables or something like that there is no reason whatsoever that this argument does not apply to other more widely used languages and the fact that slashdot commenters say insipidly to wide modding up use the right tool for the right job is irrelevant some languages are bad and some are good acknowledging this is the first step to lessening the degree of incredible mediocrity that pervades the software industry today

am indeed the odc type guy the primary reason for my original post is not my individual impact which is obviously negligible but driving more at the heart of what reddit is trying to do when some number of users are confused about what should be the core part of the business think there something wrong its not like this is some ancillary feature that people are confused about its what reddit is all about but if they re happy and things are moving along then so be it

gt if it murder how can you possibly justify killing human being just because his or her father committed criminal act some women literally cannot bring child to term when they are rape victims it just totally screws them up emotionally and not saying that its necessarily the right thing to do but do believe in that situation it should be choice of the mother because she did not take the actions that led to her current situation it was not her fault its not something done just out of convenience gt what if that child were brought to term was born and developed into an adult would it be okay to kill him at years of age if not how can you advocate killing him in utero and still claim that fetus is human being like said it depends on if the woman is emotionally stable enough to even bring the child to term not all can when it comes to rape rape is pretty horrible act mean don have first hand experience but rape involves one human being absolutely violating one another in the most disgraceful way possible rape can mess people up and for some women carrying the baby of the man who raped her can really hurt them
evil evil people
its very simple logic fetus is developing human being years ago or years ago whatever fits you you were fetus also you are now human being thus logic leads that abortion is killing human being you can make excuses for it all you want but its not difficult to understand
yep way off topic you do understand sarcasm
gt find the phrase purely out of convenience outrageous and insulting take it you re guy and not parent the responsibility of properly raising child is enormous and the fear of being crappy parent can be overwhelming even if you are married have job and house and such it easy to reach the conclusion that an abortion is better than dooming kid to life with crappy parents if you can raise the child you shouldn be doing things that by nature lead to having children this is pretty crappy example but it is one nonetheless if out joyriding and slam into someone car not going to force someone else to pay for what did take responsibility for the actions took that led to such consequences abortion for convenience and that exactly what many abortions are about are result of people wanting to avoid consequences cause and effect you don want the effect don mess with the cause

gt some women literally cannot bring child to term when they are rape victims it just totally screws them up emotionally and huh think there are any women who would be similarly screwed up emotionally and psychologically by carrying child to term in non rape related pregnancies none what about kindof rape what about coercion that cannot be proven would you require rape conviction allegation what if she doesn want to go through that either your use of the word convenience continues to be offensive and absurd your use of antibiotics is similar convenience if it is not simply matter of convenience for rape victims then consider whether there are other pregnant women for whom it is also not an act of convenience and for whom it is none of your fucking business to determine their motives or intent if you do not stop using that sort of ludicrous derision you have as much as admitted that you are not interested in rational debate on this issue
hmmm why couldn we apply that same logic even further back in chain of event if fetus is life then the things involved in making life is life and the act of making the life is responsible for that life so not having that original act is also potentially killing life based on this flawed reasoning we need strong legistlation to protect the sperm and egg no more spermicide or eggacide we must protect sperms and eggs because they can protect themselves stand up and speak for them because they can speak for themselves we need to control every egg and sperm every time two people get together man and women they must have sex if they don have sex they are potentially killing possible life don let this killing happen have sex with every person of the opposite sex you meet it your duty don let this sensing potential killing happen kinda like the conclusion sounds like lot of fun

well that debate of different sort just as soon see the government not allow abort on demand but try to take realistic perspective which accounts for the opinions of those that don share my faith murder is widely acknowledged even by atheists to be at the very least an inconvenience to the victims for abortion there significant divide between the rights of woman vs rights of baby camps mean hey not sure divorce on demand is the greatest thing either but how far will it get me to go tooting that horn

gt again you take your moral prejudice as axiom moral prejudice that an interesting term does it describe the opinions you hold also or does it somehow only apply to people like me gt there are perfectly good ways to avoid having children from contraception to sterilisation supporting those methods is much more effective at lowering unwanted childbirth rates than abstention which doesn even happen reliably amongst christian kids sorry to tell you not sure why you decided to turn this into an issue about abstinence abstinence is one of many ways to avoid having kids my point wasn that people should be abstinent if they don want kids my point purely was that an ideal way to avoid getting yourself in situation where you have to take the life of your child you provided the other ways also don know why you felt the need to throw in the christian kids part fully aware of that thanks gt yet they are consistently opposed by those who would view one of the most fundamental behaviours of the whole animal kingdom as somehow sinful and deserving of punishment the whole community is made to suffer even putting their lives at risk for the whims and hangups of vocal minority if you want to talk about immoral behaviour perhaps we could start there whoa calm down now we are talking about abortion not your ideological crusade against christianity look you may argue against me all you want but its very rarely that ll sit down in an arguement and say its this way because god wants it if provide an arguement its one that can be followed logically not advocating pro life stance here because christian but rather because logically think that it makes sense if you don want child don have sex and if you have child because you have sex you are responsible for that life but it seems like any post make you are sitting here trying to turn it into an arguement against my beliefs instead of focusing on the point at hand
have not missed the point of the debate because most of the legal arguments made in favor of government tolerated abortion assume the unborn child is alive and in some cases fully formed human being they can mostly be distilled into these caricatured forms certain people have inferior rights until they achieve certain size women cannot possibly be bothered to provide for somebody else if they don want to under any circumstance including life or death check your pro abortion ranks and the arguments actually used in legal circles if tomorrow everyone recognized that unborn children are fully human and alive you would still find quite sizeable contingent of people still asserting woman right to abort the only thing controversial about claiming developing children are in fact children are the excuses the pro abortion crowd keeps coming up with to avoid the obvious the evidence mounts year after year that we are dealing with humans an unborn child has beating heart at three weeks for goodness sake what qualities do you want these children to possess before you are satisfied that they are members of our society with the right to life like the rest of us do they need to write word essay and hum few bars of the national anthem win gold medal in the olypmics

that just depressing
gt what qualities do you want these children to possess before you are satisfied that they are members of our society with the right to life like the rest of us correct me if wrong usually all conservatives enjoy to point out to liberals such as myself that rights are inborn and by that favorite conservative definition they are things that you have all by yourself everything else is privilege two day old conception does not have that ability it is not something that it has all by itself sure we both agree that would not have right to life if it required your kidney and no one else wouldn even malign your desire for the convenience of two kidneys caricatured ps fuck you
don have problem with legalizing prostitution have problem with him suggesting that there are no other ways for single woman to provide for her children
you have ignored gwenhwyfaer point you have addressed what followed from that point but not the origin you said if you can raise the child you shouldn be doing things that by nature lead to having children and that is only true for someone who subscribes to what consider twisted and evil moral system you treat it as fact that requires no explanation
gt the biggest culprit is the technology that was supposed to make work quicker and easier experts say well if we were happy to only be as productive as in the it would have made our work quicker and easier
true things will get clicked on depending on how interesting it seems not is but titles should preferably be interesting by being representative understandable and accurate title not shiny now with more superlatives mind vaguely titled things like that quantum article though that was also the unclear article itself inaccurate ones like that ajax patented one and some others recently where after few minutes of reading discover that actually no this has nothing to do with what was wanting to read about that defeats part of the point of reddit it should make selection easier and representative title is the only thing have to go on other than rating but unless the article is undividedly interesting it probably due to feedback effect in rating guessing the first few votes probably decide the nature of the next dozen those and their timespan on where it goes from there actually it be interesting to see some statistics on that to see whether there is indeed social effect to what should purely be article rating hm

ah so we ve descended to the level of comparing newly formed embryonic children to cancer the miracle of life the scourge of life of course zero tumors have actually grown to become fully functioning persons but then zero aborted children have too so suppose the comparison is accurate am fully aware of the catholic church objection to birth control and it is of vastly different nature than their objection to abortion one opposition is in regards to the abuse of sex and the other is in regards to murder sperms and eggs do not by their very nature require defense and succor children do
oh right the moral system protecting human being from being murdered just because someone else decided to create them and then decided that they couldn keep them is twisted what is twisted is your logic you are making excuses for cold blooded murder do think that there are situations where abortion may be necessary one of those situations isn had sex with my boyfriend now pregnant and don want my baby anymore you gotta take responsbility for what you ve done that the nature of everything ironically enough it is christianity that teaches that god died so that we wouldn have to accept the consequences of all that we ve done wrong but that another subject all together

yes agree with you that do not have the right to your kidneys nor you to mine but surely the dependence of children upon their parents falls into different category or are you of the worldview that parents have no duty to provide for even their born children
thank you getson you ve proven my point the healthcare system is broken have really been perplexed lately as to why our healthcare something that should be policy concern is so intrinsically tied to our employment really hope used intrinsically correct
with all due respect why have you drawn the line at birth it seems bit arbitrary to me to grant rights to child based on their physical location inside the womb or out

gt yes agree with you that do not have the right to your kidneys nor you to mine then perhaps you should reconsider your use of the phrase right to life gt but surely the dependence of children upon their parents falls into different category or are you of the worldview that parents have no duty to provide for even their born children sure but that duty has giant obvious limits for example if they are unwilling to fulfill it they may put their child up for adoption would not have right to life if it required your kidney even if was your child would of course happily donate my kidney to my child but that my decision

here we are agreeing again what shock parent has no duty to provide their child with their own kidneys even if the child needs one but surely the duty to provide food and shelter for their children is within those giant obvious limits and isn that basically what woman is doing for the child in her womb all for the law allowing parents to give up their children for adoption if they are unable to fulfill their duties and for the same tolerance for women in unwanted pregnancies
they sure could use some modern web technology on their website maybe that would keep it from sucking
this has been studied for more than decade see productivity paradox http en wikipedia org wiki
gt but surely the duty to provide food and shelter for their children is within those giant obvious limits and isn that basically what woman is doing for the child in her womb you are avoiding my point successfully made providing food and shelter is not within that duty as the child parent may instead put it up for adoption similarly carrying child to term is not within that duty if the mother decides to have an abortion gt all for the law allowing parents to give up their children for adoption if they are unable to fulfill their duties and for the same tolerance for women in unwanted pregnancies ok if you want to require women to put up their aborted fetuses for adoption have ball if that is not your point then you are not advocating the same level of tolerance for parents in those two situations don pretend
sorry that seemed like rather straightforward reading of your rhetorical question anyway when said don have problem with legalizing prostitution assumed that it was also understood that don have problem with prostitutes
gt isn that basically what woman is doing for the child in her womb jesus christ god in heaven no can believe that didn set me off on first reading yes that is what it supplies to the fetus but that ignores completely what it demands of the mother you could just as easily say that kidneys provide unpoisoned nutrients and thus must be dutifully supplied to your children

think rsheridan is comparing one bundle of flesh to another really just rebuttal saying that because something has the same dna as human doesn mean it is human alive similarly we don qualify our thumbs or arms as alive needing special protection otherwise amputation should be reclassified as murder similarly doesn the sperm have the male dna and the egg the females dna
lot of what we have talked about has gone around the point of whether the fetus is alive or not it seems very hard to convince person to change their viewpoint on this because it depends lot on their belief system what do people feel about the other participent in an abortion does the woman have rights over her own body is it even her body who is more important the baby or the woman will they bring back melrose place
do advocate the same level of tolerance when the unborn child develops enough so that it can be safely removed from the mother womb for adoption the law should allow it but despite that you are still wrong because parents are legally responsible for providing food and shelter for their children the adoption option is the transferral of that responsibility to another person until that transfer occurs however parent must provide for his or her child their duty does not vanish immediately upon their arrival at the decision to cease being responsible for their children were parent to engage in such behavior they would be commiting crimes of neglect and abandonment similarly mother should be legally responsible for the health of her unborn child while she waits for somebody to take possession of the child for adoption just as she is responsible for the health of her born child while she waits for somebody to take possession of the child for adoption
with commercials and all and simplified plot and busty characters which is all people will remember merchandise leave my asimov alone
what separates my argument from yours and rsheridan is this what call an embryonic child even one without nervous system has one particular quality that all the sperms eggs tumors and thumbs in the world do not if allowed to develop in their natural environment they will become recognizable humans
think you left out the chastity belt when did they go out of style maybe using honour killings as deterent heard they still work great in some places you know it drives home the right moral values masturbation is quite good its the fun but it can make children or homosexuality mean that act can naturally produce children or just plain old anal oral sex think our society has too choose one of the above as national pasttime so we can engage in acts that can lead to producing children

gt do advocate the same level of tolerance when the unborn child develops enough so that it can be safely removed from the mother womb for adoption the law should allow it no you advocate the same quality of life for the child one parent you would require to purchase groceries and diapers for month the other parent you would require to bear child those are two entirely different requirements two entirely different tolerances please stop ignoring my point believe that for the same reason we must not coerce parents to supply for example their kidney to their child we must also not coerce mothers to bear children when they do not wish to do you understand my analogy why is it invalid
believe woman has rights over her own body to point do not believe she has the right to voluntarily deny sustenance to the baby in her womb as hard as it may be for some to believe sincerely sympathize with mother who is in an unwanted difficult pregnancy men who put women into that situation should be severely punished in the case of rape listen to an argument for sending such men to the gallows but surely we humans are civilized enough to not liquidate innocent children when they become burden
the only distinctive quality can see in your argument is that you delightedly threw your hands in the air when he said something that you could attack without addressing its merits wtfg he did successfully point out that your criterion has the same genetic material as human is silly way of defining legally sanctified human life earlier someone pointed out that the easier criterion could one day become human is similarly silly his point has merit so does yours totally understand that you can look at single celled organism without brain and consider it sacred human life it is obviously human life form but you must also understand how others can look at it and see single celled organism without brain the potential for human life our perspective has merit fucking admit it already

horrible interface this could so be reworked beautifully with ajax and possibly flash any designers interested in side project
excellent point would slightly reword it though if allowed to develop it has the possibility of becoming human why this wording baby can grow outside the original womb perhaps surrogate womb maybe in the future labratory possibility is used because the fetus may die no fault of the mother we don know what will happen still born birth
and most of the movies that he said were hard to rent for lame reasons were also lame movies movie box designers and movie viewers have worked out rather efficient form of communication know don want to watch seabiscuit woo even hotel rwanda which was fantastic movie is obviously not everyone cup of tea but think putting rwanda in the title might have been the more significant indicator than every indie award it could have collected
understand the analogy and think it is invalid providing body parts for one child is outside the limits of parent duty but requiring mother to bear her child to term is not woman body is precisely designed or evolved if you prefer for among other things nourishing newly formed child from its embryonic stage to its birth however no person body is designed for being parts depot for another person is it possible for person body to be such yes but then it also possible for person body to be firewood for another person fireplace so the distinction in my mind has to do with the natural function and purpose of thing in this case because woman body is naturally designed to nourish newly conceived child to birth she is required to do so however because person body is not designed to provide body parts to another person he or she is not required to do so
ユビキタス
there are number of issues have with this comment that will ignore however gt in this case because woman body is naturally designed to nourish newly conceived child to birth she is required to do so this does not follow you will have to do much much better
this reply is kind of charming but you should really broaden your definition of prosperity however you measure it before you embarass yourself days of holiday year is nice even if we technically get in the us but their life expectancy was terribly short years at most medieval serf or an enlightenment era merchant or artisan or nobleman for that matter lived life with no antibiotics terrible diet and zero attention paid to hygeine as result any encounter with infectious disease was potentially fatal moreso if doctors got involved and started draining fevered blood out of your body while you were trying to recuperate ll leave it to you to imagine what life was like to have limbs amputated with no anesthesia or to envy rich people who could affort to own book or to be ruled by people who thought of you as property and who cut off bits and pieces of people who tried to run away or to have right and wrong decided by ordeal where the guy who lost the fewest fingers was the winner or and let not forget the fact that when we say hard work we re talking about flipping hamburgers or maybe sitting in chair and writing things down all day long have you ever held job that required you to do continuous strenuous physical labor do you ever intend to hold one again isn it nice to have choice about that try that without aspirin sometime

while it is hard for you to accept zygote as child assume you would agree that the full term baby has met that status five minutes before it emerges from the womb in live birth however in the eyes of many pro abortion supporters that condition is still not enough to prevent woman from exercising her right to abortion many of them do recognize the legitimacy of taking child life if the mother wishes to do so naomi wolf expresses this in her article our bodies our souls http saturn med nyu edu yeh cf resource wolf html also if you read the text of justice blackmun decision of the court in roe wade you ll find that even though texas law clearly defined when human life began it was still not enough for the justices to tolerate them overriding woman right to abortion so be aware that the pro abortion crowd does include those who are willing to terminate infant life even if it is legally so defined

will not admit the merit of your point because it leads to arbitrary subjective evaluations of what is human life and what isn there is grave danger in opening that can of worms because someday somebody might decide to move that line forward past birth sure it makes lot of sense to you to declare that child growing in the womb is not an individual until they develop to certain point for sake of argument let put this line at the point when the organs are intact the nervous system comes online and brain waves begin to issue forth call that subjective and arbitrary because the developing child is objectively little changed from five minutes before the arrival at that point this whole business of declaring when child is actually fully qualified human disquietingly lends to the idea of quick kill it before it becomes sentient

my apologies let me state it more clearly as parents are required to provide food and shelter for their born children until that responsibility has been legally transferred to another so must pregnant mother be required to offer the equivalent sustenance to her unborn child by carrying the child to its birth child right to life imposes these duties your objection but while parents are obliged to provide food and shelter for born children they are not required to give them their body parts is not woman giving of her body in similar manner to her unborn child my response no woman body is naturally suited to carrying her unborn child to its birth man or woman body is not naturally suited to providing body parts for children or anybody else for that matter child right to life does not require parents to undertake unnatural actions in support of that right excepting those of common sense and specific legal mandate say common sense because providing food and shelter to born children may be debated as natural human action in some quarters even though can think of only very few amount of people who hold to the worldview that parents have no such obligation to their children
the real price of anything is only the value that you and place on it if for instance you valued the look of the dollar coin above the paper bill in theory without law attached you would be able to buy more with it so long as the person agreed that the dollar coin was indeed more valuable it is only with combination of law and general public acceptance that we value both as one and the same it not so with the diamond industry and have to say that de beers with the help of their marketing company could sell ketchup popcile to lady with white gloves unbelievable giving this article to every woman date it time to educate the public
the most significant aspect of the date is that the article foreshadows the demise of the debeers cartel and the devaluation of diamonds due to handful of factors investment diamonds new sources loss of control over african mines etc if anything the diamond market and debeers presume is alive and flourishing evident from displays of public consumption by rap artists ice bling and airheaded hollywood socialites with diamond crusted phones and ipods

it hard to beg the question when we re discussing an abstract definition at least think so it also prompts the questions do you agree libertarians are in favour of gun ownership do you agree libertarians are in favour of self defence using lethal means do you agree that your right to trial is dismissed in the case of being killed do you agree libertarians are therefore in favour of some cases where private ownership results in your rights being curbed when on someone elses land do you agree libertarians believe they are therefore allowed subjective definition of self defence do you agree libertarians believe they are therefore entitled to defend non lethally should hope against other subjective transgressions like theft you ve had lot of thoughtful posts so if wrong interested in hearing your point of view gt it also makes it clear that you are missing the central point of libertarianism which is that freedoms may not be removed pre emptively not for any reason no the basic principle of libertarianism is private ownership free from government coercion free to do as you will with your life and your posessions free to do what you like on your land whether that involves doing any drugs on your own land shooting tresspassers building an extension to your house burning crosses making rose garden whatever if you suspect someone of stealing from you while they are on your land under libertarian principle you should be able to detain them under the same self defence principles that would allow you to own any gun you like gt your initial example is rooted in that and is therefore erroneous regardless of the examples you re wrong here implies not therefore not is incorrect

in the comment section of the submission better explain what voting up down means user champion writes http features reddit com info id yp ys gt originally thought that voting up down story was whether you liked it and would want it to be more popular exactly what thought for the first four weeks of using reddit however user rahul responded gt from the faq gt my votes train filter gt yep so vote up links you liked and vote down links you disliked our hope is that instead of just reading list of links the community thinks should be on the front page you ll also be reading front page personalized for you filtered for quality by your fellow redditors but filtered for relevance by you let reddit know if it hot or cold find these personalized links in your recommended section this seems to answer the question case closed really don think so let start with the terminology of the faq entry http features reddit com help faq if reddit really is about filtering aticles according to how relevant they are to me then why are the guys constantly talking about votes voting is about determining what collective thinks is the best according to some scale and not what the individual thinks is best secondly why are scores shown all over the place not interested in what other people think is relevant to them and what is the idea behind top the existence of this page is probably the most important reason why people tend to think reddit is about finding the consensus about what the best article is if the votes reflect relevance to individuals then why submissions disappear beyond the minus horizont as soon as some other people think they are not relevant to them couldn they nevertheless be relevant to me maybe the other users thought well written article but not interested conclusion it no surprise that people misconceive reddit as yay or boo thingy as pg called it in comment http reddit com info id zj furthermore the choice of the term vote some ui decisions etc suggests that the guys themselves are not really sure about what they want reddit to be so what the reason for all this confusion think the problem is that there are two important dimensions that make up the space of articles relevance and quality relevance is related to the individual user and quality is consensus of the collective so quality is something you can really vote on but the problem is now that the users are only given tool to position the submission in one dimension and this dimension is in fact both relevance and quality commingled and as always when you project from dimensional space to space with less dimensions information is lost you simply cannot figure out whether the user thought the submission was relevant or high quality by looking at his votes the solution to this dilemma is obvious treat relevance and quality separately there already has been proposal about how to do this http features reddit com info id by user jbstjohn he proposes having two sets of up down his analysis must have been similar to mine but his solution is needlessly complex the point is that users already make the two distinct decisions but reddit simply doesn exploit that the decision on quality is done by using the arrows and the decision on relevance is implicitly done by clicking submissions if not interested in games wont click titles indicating this topic if interested in hydrogen producing algea will click titles talking about this stuff sometimes it will happen that click title and find that was wrong with my assumption about the topic but this is maybe one in forty cases and shouldn crush the filter which works statistically and is therefore prepared to deal with some noise so what to do now in my humble opinion let vote on quality and make scores officially being measure for quality therefore display them all over the place people like scores and charts about them but use the clicks to train the filter and use quality and relevance to compile the recommended page sorry for my poor english

in general think your conclusions are right but one thing do like about the arrows for training relevancy is have to make conscious choice about making something relevant and get the opportunity to de select later if wish you could say that letting the preference filter show you what you ve really indicated you like is better than manually telling it what you think you like but personally like the option of reading many entries and only voting on few have feeling that if click throughs were used in this fashions many people recommended queues would quickly become overly self reinforcing

went without healthcare for about years and did it by saving money and taking care of myself so did not need to spend much time in hospitals if could get an extra year right now in exchange for getting rid of my health care would do it in heartbeat can understand why people with kids might feel that they need insurance but don understand why so few unattached people self insure insurance companies do not have magic health care wand that we don have access to all they do is take bunch of people money hack some percent off the top for themselves and then give it back out to some subset of the participants get sick it therefore follows that if you are healthier than average not overweight don smoke no family history of predisposition toward disease etc you are probably better off saving money yourself than going with health insurance it does take some risk tolerance to pull this off fell off my bike around year broke my fall with my forehead and was in tough shape for days was pretty confident that worst case had concussion and that would be ok within few days was right but it was little scary far while as an aside the scale effect that you mention is actually available to people who self insure too there is freelancer union that offers medical insurance for relatively reasonable price if memory serves

tried death threats has the fbi stopped by yet
huh you didn explain how you got back to using the phrase right to life for something that has no innate ability to live but whatever didn misunderstand you were perfectly clear in that earlier quoted sentence am saying that while women bodies can naturally function to bear children that does not explain why you insist that we must force them to do so your conclusion does not follow from your argument if you would like to explain why the natural ability of women bodies means that we must force them to bear children when they do not wish to then could approach your argument right now it smells too fucking despicable
there story that circulates around in academia not sure if it true but basically some animal rights people went and released hundreds of animals from research facility rabbits believe the next day the vast majority of the animals were found dead within yds of the facility because they were domesticated animals etc to top it off it invalidated multiyear study using the rabbits that was going to end within month or week or something like that again no idea if its true or what is and isnt true but it wouldnt surprise me at all and this story goes around regularly so it kind of become legend about why to lock your stuff up and have security on any high importance trials
if you won accept my point because of some imaginary place it could lead then you have given up on your own argument gt call that subjective and arbitrary because the developing child is objectively little changed from five minutes before the arrival at that point don see how that makes it arbitrary gt this whole business of declaring when child is actually fully qualified human disquietingly lends to the idea of quick kill it before it becomes sentient ok that isn disquieting you might like to make it sound bad but it isn and it doesn disprove the point

the single most salient point is that the arrows are poor choice for the ui looking at list of items in particular order and seeing an up or down arrow next to each item in the list implies that the arrows influence the order by pushing items either up or down not certain what the best choice is thumbs up thumbs down is at least dissociated from the ordering and becoming cliche in some circles not unlike the amazon stars but the current icons aren it having popup flyover indicate that the results of your clicking can be found in recommended would be good start like tmalsburg read the explanation when first arrived at reddit then promptly forgot what it meant
while don know much about an incident like that do remember break in from http www apa org monitor julaug sc html that resulted mostly in destruction and death million in damage of pigeons missing and rats found dead since they are so unsuccessful at the goal of saving particular animals can only conclude that the break ins are meant to get people thinking about animal testing in general even then the break ins are bad idea as they make everyone sympathize with the researchers and prejudiced against animal rights activists one thing it does seem to do however is intimidate researchers not very effectively but the article proves it does happen
call junk statistics looked at the online trade mag that the blog linked to and cited and couldnt tell which article it was referring to the stats in the articles did read were weak at best plus there is some clear bias in the trade mag
converting the prices you go from about per watt peak to so the solar panel cost drops from to which is much more reasonable so much more likely to be used though you still need to look at the cost of and impact of the batteries needed to run everything at night

this looks to me like more evidence of how overblown the whole online console gaming phenom is becoming predicting that insofar as the new systems hope to cash in on multiplayer becoming huge attraction they will fail utterly the mlg of course will never go mainstream the comparison to collectible card games was dead on in my opinion but in larger sense the whole push towards broadband gaming with strangers across the country yippee is just half assed attempt by gutless industry execs to flog new life out of their obnoxiously generic fps and sports games instead of taking risk on something genuinely innovative highly recommend this article which gives such short sighted thinking pretty good skewering http www com games crash html

agreed its good to see them focused on the product but its important to remember that without revenue its hard to sustain the service and continually invest in it lack of revenue creates risk and limits what they can do with the product simple economic reality of limited resources unless of course they open up the platform to outside development or something which doesn seem to be part of their agenda my two cents
not again please stop it we have seen it thanks

find her portrayal of american security checks in airports very similar to my experiences however if you ve flown and had these experiences then why bother writing an article about it either people already know this stuff or they haven had your experiences or they don fly so they won likely care pointless article
it okay but probably like it more if the before and afters were all associated with the right pictures
now we re onto something new reddit thats linked to your paypal account bear with me each link represents verified startup the link points to page that summarizes the projects their working on whenever you click on link it donates to them ok haven figured out how the end user gets profit back except that the startup will get list of donators alright scratch that lets say that the companies above are instead teams that work on open source software the end user gets the benefit of using the great stuff they are able to work on more due to donations doesn everyone think that nice simple centralized donation system like this is just what the oss community neads

interesting my initial thoughts upon encountering reddit was oh see if like this link article can mod it up by clicking the arrow so that other people know that this is indeed worthy read cool but now after having used reddit for several weeks now find myself having to determine whether want to click the up or down arrow and how it will affect what see really shouldn have to think about the process should just say that article was terrible followed by instinctually clicking the down arrow not that article was terrible but am interested in seeeing more articles on zen meditation that where the problem occurs tmalsburg seems to have the same issues and has what appears to be reasonable solution since could click the link registering that like said topic then mod it up down registering to others it quality

intended to make fun but not by putting words in anyone mouth in american politics there are certain words that only ever get used by people with an axe to grind republicans don talk about capitalism no matter how much they may be in favor of it but they re perfectly happy to call democrats plans for universal health care socialist sustainable is an green word etc corporation was appropriated by the wto protester set in the and has moved towards the political center by morphing into general plutophobia whatever you may believe about global capitalism attacking straw man corporations as proxy is pretty silly in the us corporations employ maybe of the work force sarbox will shrink that figure and only of those people work for the big scary global corporations that everyone been up in arms about the proportion of wealth they control is similarly small most businesses are partnerships or proprietorships and have only handful of employees most corporations have no employees or assets and exist so that self employed people can shield themselves from liability on the other hand if you re really concerned about things like third world poverty environmental depredation genocide and whatnot there are all kinds of more productive targets out there corrupt bureaucracies dictatorships developing nations and former communist states are where start if thought the world were broken and needed fixing

not at all my whole point if you had bothered to look past my total condescension and contempt shame on you was that the relevant distinction is between medieval serfs and modern citizens not between modern americans modern italians or residents between any other modern country tend to think that comparisons between different nations standards of living is modern standards of living are so much higher than historical ones that lifestyle differences between cultures come out in wash besides nobody can be expected to make an objective comparison between their own country us and other countries them except the people who sincerely believe they have proof that their lifestyle is the best

appreciate the fact that you didn respond to my rudeness in kind probably misread chu comment above the problem with your argument about productivity and the minimum wage is that productivity increases don just happen you have to find ways to innovate in the post wwii years advances in automation and control engineering were increasing the productivity of the average factory worker today we re increasing the productivity of managers and marketers with web shopping and data mining it un sayable in political environment but the ugly truth is that minimum wage employees aren driving today boom in personal productivity that leaves gini watchers with few options do nothing spend money on worker education and vocational training then hope for the best redistribute income paul graham tells us what to think http www paulgraham com inequality html there gt let rehearse the chain of argument so far heading for conclusion to which many readers will have to be dragged kicking and screaming so ve tried to make each link unbreakable decreasing economic inequality means taking money from the rich since risk and reward are equivalent decreasing potential rewards automatically decreases people appetite for risk startups are intrinsically risky without the prospect of rewards proportionate to the risk founders will not invest their time in startup founders are irreplaceable so eliminating economic inequality means eliminating startups raise the minimum wage which we try to do but has all kinds of potentially distortionary effects many of wal mart much lamented labor practices like hour workweeks for part timers and clock shaving by managers are an effort by the firm to recoup the value in labor of the amount they re required to spend in wages if it was as grotesquely unfair as some people make it out to be wal mart would have tougher time finding workers wishful thinking get innovative entrepreneurs interested in making factory workers more productive again any ideas

the low life expectancy in pre th century times is somewhat misleading because of the high infant mortality it true that average life expectancy was less than years but that because large number of infants died before the age of not because the population as whole lived shorter lives if you survived to adolescence you had as good chance of living to age as you do today you can verify this by visiting any cemetary there are lots of graves of people that were even years old there are also lots of small headstones for children that died at age to put it cynically we now kill our babies before they re born or conceived rather than letting them die in childhood somewhat more humane but it can do ugly things to the numbers

while on the subject of filters how does the filter work anyway is it an empirical formula conceived after much trial and error is it some sort of bayesian filter does it look for keywords and keeps track of what keywords you liked disliked never use the recommended section really don know why maybe because don want to miss something interesting which ultimately means don trust the filter voting based on quality importance seems more logical to me since all reddit user will benefit from it but then again don vote after reading only the link title

isn there very simple solution to this ve personally always wondered why exactly where was the option to both vote an article up down and also save button it always seemed unnecessary to me to have both because if you vote an article up or down it ll be saved for you later anyway same with hide although it does have very real physical function it makes the article disappear from your view why not in some way identify the save hide buttons as ways to affect your recommended page after all saving hiding articles is personal thing it affects no one else but you is that just too simple of solution or am missing something here cliff note version up down stay as they are with the exception that they no longer will affect your recommended page and ratings based off that and the save hide buttons will be used to affect your recommended page and related features instead plus this keeps the current simplicity of reddit there no real reason to add yet another feature if current feature will do the trick very well its just that it needs to be obvious in some way as others have said maybe hover box that will make it clear that save hide will affect your personal recommendations
no we use them for experiments because most of us value human life more than animal life and experiments on them may increase the quality of human life not advocating torturing fuzzy bunnies advocating responsible experimentation as stated originally
ok agree that both men and women may compare themselves to magazine ideals however the different frequencies of eating disorders negative self image elective cosmetic surgery etc as well as casual observation certainly suggest that women do so more often or perhaps more seriously than do men it not just womens issue but there are differences in how such media depicts and affects male and female audiences
going to relate this to the nba dunk competition but stay with me the rules to the dunk competition have changed to allow players many attempts unlike old rules which allowed for only this like the skating rules allows competitors to attempt difficult and innovative performances instead of playing it safe as result the most recent competition had one player miss dunks in row but it also had some of the greatest slams in recent years including the incredible one by andre igoudala http www youtube com watch juo vrjxb the point is there are trade offs to having the skaters attempt difficult performances without losing due to mistake
don think clicking is good way to train the filter often click something out of curiosity on the new page but then see on the full page that it really doesn interest me one sentence isn really enough to see wether something is interesting it works especially bad for intentional spam

gt never use the recommended section really don know why maybe because don want to miss something interesting which ultimately means don trust the filter feel the exact same way one thing just happened to notice just for the heck of it decided to check out the recommendation link and one of the links there was called add features without sacrificing simplicity don kill your best asset now on the features subreddit ve never ever voted an article up or down but the title is extremely similar to statement just made in my comment so is recommendation somehow tied into comments
was behind your proposal until realized something clicking on submissions is not good way to decide on relevance most users would click on the submissions before looking at any comments right so what if submitted link on oranges but titled it top lisp programming errors that title would garner lot of click throughs but the submission was low quality would only see the don click warnings after popped into the comments to complain since we re talking about two axes here why not create an icon that standard decision matrix you have good no good axis on the vertical and relevant not relevant on the horizontal and people would just click on the quadrant that matches their impressions public scoring is based on the quality scores and your filter is trained with the relevancy axis it might also be interesting to let high karma people relevancy rankings influence some of the articles too maybe preference would work ie trust your quality relevancy plots so let your relevancy filter affect mine with that think it might be interesting to see zoomed in scatter plot when you view comments get sense of where articles are generally being plotted

tmalsburg like the thought you have put into your comment and it seems lot of us have been having the same ideas think the solution though is to keep the arrows as they are adding more arrows or stars or whatever would just clutter reddit nice interface so it would seem that what you click on as you suggested is all you have left but that is also bad idea for some obvious reasons think that really the problem boils down to what people expect their vote means in terms of training their own filter for their recommeded page most of us believe that there is some kind of tagging system going on behind the scenes hence the connundrum when you like particular topic but not particular article do you vote it down or not for fear that articles on that topic will disappear from your recommended page now the reddit guys seem pretty smart and hopefully they aren using any explicit tagging system the best solution would be to do some data clustering on users based on what they vote up or down that way people with similiar interests could vote up and down the good and bad articles on the same topic be whatever it is and only the good would be recommended to you for some info on data clustering see here http en wikipedia org wiki data_clustering

the party in power makes no difference what so ever when it comes to government spending the government has grown during every single administration since fdr and probably before the only way to reduce government spending is to consistently take out of office anyone who proposes anything other than reducing the size of the government regardless of the program this has to be done at all levels of government and regardless of anything else the person may have done voting for new programs or increased taxes should be political suicide most things are not the government business and therefore the government does not need money to act on those things

haven flown el al but did fly lufthansa out of tel aviv couple of years back so have some experience with israeli airport security it didn suck as much as what we have here and that for couple of reasons first they have more experience with it but primarily it was because israeli airport security concentrates on what actually makes difference and not on what makes big show for example our checked baggage was depressurized before the flight to make sure that it didn contain pressure fused bombs this isn big obvious thing but it is lot more useful than making everyone take off their shoes which we didn have to do not that there wasn plenty of security theater too you can go into public building like shopping center without guard peering casually into your briefcase first

well sorry have to disagree because think that arrows are actually the best metaphor gt seeing an up or down arrow next to each item in gt the list implies that the arrows influence the gt order by pushing items either up or down yepp and that exactly what those arrows do if you click the up arrow you push the item up the list though admittedly not always in the literal sense and if you click the down arrow you push the item down this time in the most literal sense it completely disappears from the list for me the metaphor works incredibly well you know personally think reddit should just stick with its darn beautiful simplicity heck that the main if not the only point why reddit is so different and orders of magnitude better than the other gazillion similar sites out there it not crammed with junk don need no freaking stars don need no freaking plots pop ups or tooltips don want no freaking voting matrices come on give me break don want to have to vote an item on bunch of totally independent yet mysteriously interwoven steplessly zoomable scales just want to make binary choice good no good period you know if want to see some useless charts can go to any stupid site out there don need reddit for that reddit is not about all singing all dancing hideous thingies it about focus simplicity and beauty please don change it ah and one more thing tmalsburg does have point over there gt let vote on quality and make scores gt officially being measure for quality that an excellent suggestion the only problem is it will never work this is the internet you can agree on anything here and we most certainly cannot coerce anyone into doing anything whenever cast vote you can possibly know my reasons and you can ask me and if you could would probably lie to you like in of cases and you couldn possibly know that either thus all things considered here are my suggestions reddit staff keep it like it is keep it simple reddit users if you wanna mod something up just mod it up and if you wanna mod something down then just mod it down whatever the reason and if you don want to vote at all then just don vote do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law heck the rules are so simple why in heaven name do we always try to make things complicated

granted lot of that video comes off as being cool and the music doesn help that impression but can see the possibilities especially when the user is navigating through images and resizing windows it looks quicker and more accurate you effectively have multiple mouse pointers which are your fingers so can communicate more to computer than with traditional one mouse situation like touch screens and tablet pcs we aready communicate our intentions with gestures of our hands and fingers anyway so it not the gestures that are new in this video but the gestures in this video don go though proxy of hardware think could work much quicker with an interface like that

hopefully reddit will get more and more popular more and more links will be submitted the new queue will get larger and larger people who spend time going through the new queue and promoting demoting them should be rewarded somehow currently reddit only increases your karma if you submit popular links thereby making links available for the rest of the reddit community but if someone ranks sites on the new queue they have done service to the reddit community and should likewise be rewarded perhaps the karma increase should depend on the score of the link week after it was posted this would prevent people from karma whoring by promoting all the links in the new queue
gt so be aware that the pro abortion crowd does include those who are willing to terminate infant life even if it is legally so defined yes and the pro life crowd includes those who are willing to terminate doctor lives if they are willing to perform abortions don see how pointing to the more radical ideas of others contributes to your debate with rsheridan

update ve been thinking about this entry over the last few days particularly in light of the austrian fiasco and wondering if the original entry was too cynical critical or petty itself tonight though nbc nightly news aired the story too many on the olympic team and echoed my sentiments exactly really exactly in fact nbc story identified the exact same four athletes and cited the exact same lack of team spirit that mentioned guess that is somewhat satisfying now if only get nbc to pay up for stealing my story

actually you are advocating torture those fuzzy bunnies will suffer extreme pain in some cases you just feel the torture could result in an increase in the quality of human life therefore in your eyes it is worth performing no longer can comfortably say that value human life more than animal life also can no longer comfortably say that animals are resource for human beings to use

design methodologies that use some randomness to search the design space is not good example of biological evolution design processes are designed with purpose in mind they operate in carefully controlled environments the theory of evolution postulates no intervention by an intelligent designer and no purpose when search spaces are large intelligence techniques often use elements of randomness this does not make the process as whole random to illustrate doctor may treat patient by narrowing down the list of possible ailments and then randomly assigning treatments until treatment is successful this is different from randomly selecting medications from pharmaceutical catalog another example when trying to make proof mathmatician may randomly try different approaches but this is different from giving monkeys pencils and paper and waiting for monkey to produce the proof examples of artificial selection to produce new breeds of animals or plants likewise do not provide any support for evolutionary theory artificial selection is no more natural process than medical diagnosis theorum proving or circuit design the key problem involved in complex design is that there are many more ways to do something wrong than to do something right any purely random unguided process will long term fail to consistently do the right things necessary to produce good design natural selection being natural process does not produce complex design rather natural selection just describes way to characterize mutations when mutation very much degrades an organism ability to survive then that organism fails to survive this does not mean that the surviving organisms are in anyway improved they too are experiencing random mutations which on the whole are degenerative but not so degenerative that they fail to survive to the next generation see the history of life not as triumphal march of evolution but rather bitter fight with devolution the processes controlling life information dna are redundant and very reliable they appear to be be designed to rezist the corruption caused by random mutations neverthess it is hard to hold off entropy indefinitely the information encoded into life at creation is slowly being destroyed among humans there are many random mutations in our genetic information most of the time at least for now these changes are not noticable because there exists good copies of the information which overide the bad but over time hopefully long time mutations will continue to accumulate and genetic diseases will be more common modern technology has helped lesson the effects of our decline where would we be without penicillin and its derivitives without eyeglasses without our systems of raising food without our abilities to generate and harness enormous energy to provide light heat and transportation think we would be feeling more evidence of our decline as species and we would talk less of evolution
the former it is very difficult question to answer when you consider that animals feel pain like we do my brother just finished his phd in chemistry and is now working in the pharm industry just the other day he told me how some of his compounds were promoted to dog testing and that few of the dogs died it bothered both of us especially since we both have dogs that we consider part of the family
there is such thing called testing on people it called clinical trials and it multibillion dollar industry subjects must sign an informed consent before they enter the trial of course rather sign for trial after the drug device has been tested for safety on animals this usually involves two different species one of them usually rodent eg lab rats and the other non rodent mammal eg monkey it been fun reading so many comments from people who do not realize the agony of working on this and having to administer drug or plug device to an animal attenuated only by the hope of it helping bring about therapies for colon cancer parkinson you name it
excuse me why on earth do we think animal rights activists are the bad guys understand some groups are militant but not sure why the rest of the world should align ourselves together against the very people who spend their lives trying to make it better for those with no voice hope everyone who made comment here seriously checks every bottle of shampoo moisturiser lipstick hairspray sunscreen foundation toothpaste etc etc for the explicit not tested on animals statement you are very wrong to think cosmetics companies are irrelevant procter and gamble johnson and johnson and all the big names test frequently on animals have asked them myself the reason you may be misguided on this is that the law does not ask them to label their products propoganda against animal rights organisations and anyone who gives hoot about the world is pumped out so people feel good about bashing down those trying to help maybe instead of raving on about how activists are the biggest threat to the world the guy in the article may have told us some of the information about animal testing that universities and other major organisations try so hard to hide then at least we can make an informed choice instead of voicing our ill informed support of things we know nothing about

his articles raise some interesting topics but tend to take what he says with fairly large grain of salt
gt this man lives in the most prosperous corner of the most prosperous society humankind has ever produced had thought this referred to the us specifically rather than the whole industrialised world so it seemed to be worth considering italy which think along with spain offers the best life all round because they have lively debate about creeping americanisation destroying their quality of life mentioned medieval living in passing really in reference to the idea that you lose something for each thing you gain
it can be as simple as just the capacity for pain though no matter what peter singer may think because if that was all there was to it we could simply sever all of an animal sensory nerves remove its ability to experience pain and then it be okay to treat it any which way we pleased that can be right either animal testing bothers me too but also know that if it weren for it we lack lot of medical knowledge that has not only saved human lives but saved animal lives as well veterinary medicine tends to leech off of human medicine in fairly short order after all those lives we ve saved can be valueless or unimportant because if so then so would the lab animals lives be some might say then that we should use carefully controlled animal testing even if it means pain for the subject animals in order to minimize overall suffering on the part of everybody but that simple utilitarianism which deeply allergic to aldous huxley brave new world inoculated me against that philosophy long time ago in truth there are no simple straightforward answers to questions this thorny that large part of why disagree with the animal rights activists their answer is too simple too pat think the question is too big to have such small answer
first read about avvenu on russell beattie blog couple of months ago in his blog entry russell looks at orb soonr and avvenu for remote access services and ends up selecting avvenu read his blog for more details on how he ends up picking avvenu which he describes as the easiest simplest yet most useful of all the services since ve had mixed results with combination of remote desktop vnc cvs and other solutions decided to give avvenu shot
gt excuse me why on earth do we think animal rights activists gt are the bad guys because they destroy terrorize and threaten to kill and then they claim that they re the good guys that is deeply sick misunderstand me right know that violence is sometimes the only answer and that it can be necessary tool in certain situations just don be like the loony alfers and pretend that violence doesn damn well hurt people even al quaeda knows better than that
computer program is intelligent to the degree that it programmer was intelligent computer is simply tool just like paper and pencil are tools if the circuit was designed using paper and pencil would you call the design unintelligent because paper and pencil are insentient of course not perhaps all intelligent guided processes can be thought of as methods to increase the probability of desired result great example of this is cheating at casino casino games are designed to make money for the casino over time by giving the house an advantage in the odds whenever someone consistently wins over the house even if these winnings are are relatively small and well distributed casino security is suspicious it just too unlikely that someone lucky streak can consistently defy the laws of statistics the more likely explanation is that the winner is using some purposeful intelligent method to shift the odds in his favor even by few percentage points enough to give her the statistical edge as understand it nature is like casino constantly increasing its entropy constantly breaking things down the only way to beat the house is to cheat by using an intelligent guided process engineers obviously do this for living but everyone does this everytime you clean your desk take shower or do any of the many little things you do to keep yourself and surroundings in good working order you are cheating nature putting off the disorder that comes naturally nature is not friendly force helping everything evolve it is the enemy destructive force slowly and relentlessly destroying everything it doesn even have the creative force to keep your room clean much less cause dirty puddle to evolve into the diversity of life we see around us

what would happen if an american published one of these writers on their freely available blog if they got arrested it would make huge ruckus all over the media because you know blog and free speech online
the problem of photoshopping in magazines is overhyped if you belive body image problems stem from impossible ideals created in photoshop watch tv and music videos instead of reading magazines no photoshopping of models is taking place but somehow doubt that solves anything at least with magazine you can tell yourself it isn real on slightly unreleated note an advantage with photoshopping still images is anybody can get this done you don have to be magazine model
the space could go one character sooner too how many meanings does dirty have anyway
this is footnode didn want it in the original post and reddit has no markup capability in that area realise music videos etc are heavily computer processed but to compare that to the kind of photoshop edits that people complain about here would be disingenuous
the notes could be taken out of context perhaps rumsfeld was covering all bases right after the oklahoma federal building bombing people immediately blamed islamic extremist when if fact it was domestic terrorist after all saddam did try to have bush senior assassinated conceivably they could have been behind
as far as can see we re all off track making abortion illegal does in no way stop abortion it just increases the chances of the mother dying too through unsafe abortions basically making abortion illegal achieves nothing but more pain and deaths regardless of any morals
disagree if someone makes an ass of themselves they should not be able to make it disappear at the click of mouse if they edit their original post asking their repliers for forgiveness and for deletion of the replies and they comply fabulous otherwise let people live with the consequences of their posts
how about making the reward just ridiculously low points of karma per article vote that clicks per point assuming the person actually posts this would not give them any unfair advantages easily after all every time you post you tempt karma loss or karma gain
you can imagine company maximizing their profit by limiting the quality of their service to lower cost since there isn any real competition because they have the advantage of being natural monopoly

awesome
nice like how they re looking backwards while they re walking forwards
the rules are simple if you are only looking at the hot page or top page they aren so simple when you are trying to use the recommendation page think that is the base of this arguement think about it if there was no recommendation page the only way votes could be interpreted is as this article will be moved up in the rankings for as you said whatever personal reasons the user has if there was only recommended page however you would be actively trying to train reddit to give you quality links of relevant links something different from moving up the link for everybody think they should keep reddit the same if they choose one of these options but don think they want to do that because the real innovation is in the recommended page now maybe there is way they can do pattern finding on clicks comments as well as votes as long as the hot page is the default people will associate up and down with finding whats good for other people not whats finding relevant to them it is very interesting question
of course it for testing the machine how could you trust scanning machine without testing it with anything
and the kind of quality difference you get from the pros is like night and day fine feature definition dual layer plated vias silk screened insulation and labels yeah don even think about doing your own boards for digital electronics
they could be taken out of context but given everything we know do you really think so read the woodward book for more inside scoop as for okc there is still unknown accomplices out there the sketch of john doe was not just someone imagination and the bush senior assassination plot has raised serious questions not least of them being the case against the accused has been thought of as seriously flawed as for your last idea saddam was not behind
not really sure what your point is is it that photoshop itself doesn cause the problem well of course it doesn even without photoshop we re already seeing far greater percentage of beautiful people than is realistic through music videos tv etc don think anyone saying it only an issue because of photoshop it how we use it to intensify the unreality of the beautiful people we re already seeing in the media also judging from the popularity of this link would guess that it not so easy for people to tell when it real otherwise why would we be so fascinated by site that exposes the photoshopping
it was interesting to see who was not in the list microsoft oracle etc
it because of the difference between burst bandwidth and sustained bandwidth everyone agrees that it is good to be able to have high burst rate on your connect this means that when you have to use lot of bandwidth you can do it but the definition of burst is that it doesn occur all the time when you sign up for mb down mb up internet connection you have to understand what you re really buying if you buy business internet connection then you can expect these to be sustained rates of data transfer for home internet connection these should be treated as burst rates the reason for this distinction is economics the function of an isp is to spread the cost of an upstream connection over many customers the isp actually pays lot of money for its connections to the major backbone providers their job is to keep everyone latency low and to do that they must purchase extra bandwith to meet the data transfer load with the advent of bittorrent isps are faced with problem of dramatically increased bandwidth consumption they must either throttle the consumption or buy more bandwidth and pass the cost on to the consumer with higher prices it hard to raise prices isps already offer two classes of connection business and home mbit sdsl business connection will push kb up and pull kb down simultaneously sustained home connections are much cheaper and rightly have poorer service home connections in the usa are quite inexpensive considering that american residential areas are so large and require significant infrastructure maintenance it is invalid to compare usa internet prices with those of japan and south korea because those countries have population density that is far higher than the usa population density translates into customer density increased customer density changes the economics of the infrastructure allowing better services to be offerred for lower prices until the advent of bittorrent most customers enjoyed business connection service on their cheap home connection with the increase in consumption the isps must throttle the home connection in some manner it matter of physics and economics in my opinion isps should determine their traffic scheduling algorithm and publish it on their websites and advertisements this way the customer can know what he buying this would eventually lead to isps offerring multiple service levels differing not only in bandwidth but also in scheduling algorithms the article says that sandvine system limits the number of connections per customer think that it would be better to limit the bandwidth of the customer rather than the number of connections the customer could then configure his file sharing app to decrease its bandwidth usage when making voip call or playing game eventually we will have qos scheduling deployed across the internet then our voip calls will be crystal clear despite an maxed pipe to the upstream provider the isps will drag there feet on this while they re trying to make money on their own voip systems it may take government regulation to get them to support the qos standards that will emerge soon

my girlfriend school prohibits wifi even though they have no wifi network of their own and thus no wireless connection to screw up if they don want to support any student wifi device that fine suspect that their actual problem is that they don have switched network and everyone is on private ip addresses so if someone plugs in the wrong end of their router amp thus dhcp server everyone in the building gets fucked the obvious solution is to bless with or without support particular brand model wifi device that has no incorrect ethernet port to plug in for example the airport express but they won do that because they are too busy being self righteous about what students do with my network

another excellent essay have an issue with one of the foot notes however when you comment on peoples beliefs of how things are being clouded by the way they wish things were and that religion is the best index of that have to disagree my experience with the best examples of people of faith is that their faith is often confirmed by experience having personally witnessed what some people call miracles find it hard to deny the existence of something beyond the full reduction of science but often wish that it was not so something outside myself also places bounds on my personal freedom although it can give some of the guidance you write about guess that even you have to admit that they way you wish things were has strong impact on the way things will be and so it may not be as black and white as your footnote makes it out to be

like reddit the way it is at the moment therefore thought at first well maybe you are right keep everything like it is now it seems to work somehow does it matter why it works in particular probably not but reddit wont stay like it is now even if not one single bit of the software is going to be changed the reason is that the users of reddit change in particular the number of them why that problem you may ask it because reddit is at the moment de facto about casting votes for the best article now we know that voting is about finding consensus something as much as possible people can agree with and the more participants there are in this process the less candidates remain maybe brain washed by ray kurzweil http mitworld mit edu video but it seems that the growth of the number of users could be exponential and that probably means that variety may vanish pretty fast and the main topic of reddit will converge to the one and only apple the zillions of articles about apple are the reason why slashdot bores me lately actually there will be second topic google so that the democracy illusion will be preserved we know this pattern from nearly every democratic state you always have exactly two major parties which essentially do not differ all too much the outcome is predictable today apple tomorrow google apple google boring ok there maybe bit of exaggeration in the above stated but you get the idea really think it not about choosing between leaving reddit as it is now and trying to follow the trail to what seems to be the original goal of reddit being personal topic filter rather it about the question whether reddit will succeed in some way or develop into another boring and redundant geek newsticker which is to fail

just to quickly weigh in again tend to agree with tmalsburg as noted and he right we have extra information for training what we re interested in by what we clicked so new suggestion one extra button something like undo for clicking or spammed or something so clicks normally train your filter arrows indicate quality and perhaps an up arrow an extra point for your filter but whatever we the users don have to know and button for when we feel we were suckered into clicking and don want the link included in our filter of course having no idea how the filter works to actually correlate articles don know how reasonable the whole thing is do know that don tend to use the recommended page that much because the hot page seems to give me more of what want which is bit counter intuitive

assuming that you have selected the pref don show sites after ve disliked them which believe is the default you can just vote them down and they ll disappear at first didn want to do this because have no inherent objection to the idea of for example türkçe reddit and in fact think it good idea so didn really want to vote them down but then realized that people who speak turkish can easily find the turkish reddit no matter how many or how few points it has especially if they also filter out the language subreddits that they re not interested in
also should mention that just offering this as current workaround to the clutter not saying that the idea of grouping language subreddits into different category is bad one in fact think it good idea and will be voting this suggestion up

given that we know how many points link has accumulated we could tell more about its quality if we also knew how many times the link had been followed eg something with points and clicks might be less interesting worthwhile then something with only points but clicks frankly don have clue except that reddit is rather good in it current incarnation
great comment halfway down by the way if someone makes it point to embarrass you because of speech impediment consider learning the computer programming language we call lisp to eventually attain so much skill and ability that you are worth great deal of money then leverage your value to start your own business and become so successful that you have amassed an even greater and unspeakable amount of money so that you might lobby your respective country politicians to create and pass obscure legislation that practically gurantees the doom and misfortune of the specific people who taunted you all along an alternative means to this end may include any combination of woodchipper chainsaw lbs pound anvil acme brand dangerous out of state illegal fireworks and pyrotechnics or trained seahorse assasins sic

couple of years back was reading lisp in small pieces at my in laws relative of relative got very interested and started asking me questions about it was surprised since didn even know that he programmed after minute or two my wife realized the truth of the situation and broke in to mention that the lisp was reading about was programming language you see the fellow was talking to is speech therapist he was just as surprised that was reading about lisps as was that he cared part of what was funny about it was how many words we shared but which had subtly different meanings interpreter syntax semantics symbols etc was able to confuse him pretty badly without even trying

take your point that looks like dilemma however don think that it is dilemma honestly think that at the end of the day it doesn matter let me explain as was saying on several previous occasions believe in the so called hive mind or the wisdom of crowds believe in what kevin kelly http reddit com info id ds and clay shirky http shirky com writings group_enemy html had to say highly recommend that you take minute to follow these links in other words if we were only two users here then yes could seriously harm you by not using the system in the same way as you but as long as we are many all irregularities will just be ruled out thus think what each of us should do is just figure out how he she personally wants to use the system and then just use it that way and it will work if you would love to use the recommended page then just vote accordingly if you prefer using the top page then just vote accordingly if you want to mod down each and every article submitted by user just because he called you douchebag in comment then just do it it doesn matter the system will work it will work for you and it will work for everyone else you just have to follow your own interests noone can control you anyway noone can coerce you into doing anything but what you were going to do anyway now wait hold on think about it am not saying that you must be complete egoist what saying is that you must be complete egoist if you want to if you want to be complete altruist instead then just be complete altruist if you want to be something in between just be it if you want to be an egoist today and an altruist tomorrow just act accordingly if you wanna post the greatest articles ever post them if you wanna spam then spam if you wanna be karma whore be karma whore if will all even out just don spend too much time trying to figure out the community needs because there is no such thing as the community needs each and every one of us has slightly or greatly different needs anyway and you can change it we re humans not clones you can try to serve everyone but only to fail you can try to be the jack of all trades but you ll just end up being the master of none bottom line just go out and do whatever is best for you heck that how everything works on this planet economics politics fashion you name it
that is amazing

enough about lisp do all articles about lisp automatically make the hot list how about starting lisp reddit com for this stuff not that lisp isn cool but honestly
think the stuff in his belly is passion does anyone else agree
oops who has the power to delete stuff like this when it happens better yet the submission form should check for valid uri keyword self amp valid anchor text
agreed on top of that this piece is just fluff claim like lisp is the most important idea in computer science needs to be justified but this article fails to do so
the funny thing is that people on lisp freenode get very upset whenever someone mentions reddit it just called the word there
overly dramatic title here but yeah pretty damn good
oh yes he gotta know how to take me places ve never gone before
hmm like the original better it more dramatic less emo
noticed that too glad someone looked into that
but he just talking about taping your reply card to brick taping it to well packed box sounds like it would work great
another perfect example of the main american problem not recognizing they have faults like everyone else at least me and most people know in germany don see every action of our government as perfectly correct we know we have only very limited control over our democratic government americas problem is patriotism blind faith in your own government that is almost unknown here in germany after the events of the third reich
this seems like lot of work for not really that much fun
really vaguely recall seeing it called that once in the logs http meme com cdates html channel lisp but thought it was joke does anyone there get seriously flamey about it though if you start asking whether something in lisp is as good as its scheme counterpart incidentally people should see the scifi channel battlestar galactica forums when someone calls the show gino
figured it was soul

actually common lisp the speech impediment is the title of post linked to from that post which is titled on lisp on line guess there some google juice spillover http lemonodor com archives html contains completely different ad hoc community in its comments it even got journalists trolling for stories but at least the comments are in line with the topic of the post the grand daddy of threads having nothing to do with the post subject though is http lemonodor com archives html comments and don think single one has to do with lisp and yet hundreds of people had to answer the question what is this weblog about in order to get their comment past my filters

eric veach sly boy in very little known phd thesis by him was published on an innovative rendering method that would offer physically accurate levels of rendering that method is finally coming to commercial setting in maxwell http www maxwellrender com that method has several other nicities such as being basically immune to scene size pretty much constant scaling wrt polygon count and light sources and being almost perfectly parallel he was snapped up by pixar very soon after and as far as can find didn produce anything more in that area the method used some very good statistical tools basically learnt stats off the thesis so he got hired by google eh cunning

behold citizens am the spirit of paul graham ve posessed the mind of one andyn for the purpose of this comment what my own account no that belongs to some rails weenie anyway silence impudent fool following this and numerous other incidents we ve decided to do away with the old name and re brand the language something new fresh bold and hip boldly carrying it into the st century my cohorts and evil minions have pondered long and hard and after consuming the blood of hundred virgins come up with new name for lisp henceforth lisp shall be known as zvkomöjö zvkomöjö org shall shortly contain web pastel shades sans serif fonts and stock photos of business types grinning from ear to ear as all good websites are wont to do these days that is all go about your business my lisp peons uh mean zvkomöjö peons oh and keep voting up those zvkomöjö stories mmmkay uhhh my head hey who been playing with the caps lock key what am doing here
the article makes fair point about software design once the algorithm design is understood in plain english it is then described for the computer processor through compiler which translates language like assembly scheme into binary form have problem with his method though if wanted to translate something wrote in english into spanish the quickest way would be to translate it directly assuming my command of the spanish language was strong what if found it easier to translate written french into spanish easier than translating from english would it be pertinent for me to translate my english to french then my french to spanish maybe for me yes but the vast majority would be faster in using only single step programmer strong in should also program more efficiently if he she writes the code without using an intermediate language of course the point made about getting the algorithm correct before enhancing the performance can be good advice he essentially used scheme to write high level pseudo code of the algorithm for his program if you fight more with language like to express code compared to other languages you re not programmer if were to program in python would need to struggle more with the language than would with my efficiency in implementing code in language am less familiar with will always be less in know the best way of doing things from experience for many given problems in other languages do not in java may not have known that stringbuffer is much faster than string class in know to append strings faster with len sprintf message len java programmer may not have know the latter either scheme is not faster than except for the author at that point in time sorry for my late long winded reply

agree too how can one say that programming language is the most important idea in computer science and to justify it he lists couple of quotes about how great lisp is the way see it computer science is bit more than this one can not just chose programming language as the best idea
gt agree evidence doesn do anything for those who don understand basic logic and reasoning concepts or don want to understand that seems to be the problem people can reason about things unrelated to what they believe but the moment their belief appears to be contradicted poof reason is gone

no kidding although do not smoke pot really don understand why it hasn been decriminalized someone spent years making this bust years of tax payer money and more tax money likely spent on the trial then even more to cover prison costs and the people he supplied with pot will just get it somewhere else believe the amount of crime violence and wasted resources sacrificed in not decriminalizing pot far outweighs the negative ramifications of the fact is we cannot singularize this morality the net expense is too great applaud the states which have been passing bound legislation

the problem is bill clementson blog is aimed at lisp using audience who presumably are acquainted with the whole discussion and have informed opinions pro con it not aimed at general audience as for alan kay claim there are at least broad features in common lisp implementations which allow users to deal with code on kind of meta second order level manipulation of code within data structures during say compiletime the metaobject protocol http wiki alu org and the reader is this terribly advanced depends on your perspective many earlier lisp users seemed to assume that common lisp was just some politically motivated codification of few strains of lisp and would be naturally obsoleted with time by that yardstick we seem to be in the nightmare scenario another perspective is that lisp is the most advanced programming tool in existence in some ambiguous overall sense and of course yet another perspective is that lisp users are just another bloc of monkeys peddling snake oil who ve taken it in their heads to use tools of marketing in order to appeal to the business world whether or not one agrees with that argument it certainly possibility to keep in mind if lisp is truly so good it should stand up to rational scrutiny by reasonably openminded people problem is though just as alan kay isn hanging around websites all day answering questions you probably won get satisfactory answers on usenet either

here in vancouver alot of veitnamese gangs are envolved in growing pot the way the governemnt catches them is to simply look at the electricity bill to circumvent this most pot growers rent basements for few month and move out as soon as the pots are harvested but the looks of this house in question the investment must be huge they can be caught very fast if they tap into the grid am guessing that they probably have their own generators
oh please my screen is not or less my screen is huge that is not the issue not everybody keeps their browser window maximized believe it or not yet this page and its ilk wants to make sure that it surrounds its meager pixels of content with as much blank space as my huge monitor will allow so it invasively resizes my browser window to its maximum allowed size
in callifornia and other places no doubt industrial growers go off the grid and use generators to avoid being busted by their electricity bill diesel is lot harder to track especially since there are lots of legit uses for large quantities of it

do not think saddam was behind am merely stating that for the first few hour after the attack it was anyone guess as to who was behind it sure most people believed it was bin laden and rightfully so but still doesn mean the government didn consider other parties responsible the missing accomplice from the okc attack just strengthens my point that rumsfeld wanted to find evidence fast for fear if there was connection between saddam and it would disappear just don understand how people think this administartion is so evil that all it wants is war as miss guided as the iraq was is think bush truly felt it was the right thing to do

the war on drugs is not meant to be won and it not meant to reduce drug use it meant to trick people into thinking politicians are doing good things same with gun control the war on poverty and every other government program government programs are way of consolidating government power by doing something that looks good and making people think the government is necessary appearance trumps substance drug abuse is worse now that when the drug war was started many people realize that it stupid but many others believe what the government tells them that without the war on drugs their kids will go to raves and do then they can sleep well content that the government has taken over the responsibility of keeping their kids away from drugs while their kids go out to raves and do

think this video is must see was skeptical for the first half hour but it raised few questions that simply couldn ignore and was converted to the point that would really like some answers the wtc building collapsed in free fall time no it wasn jet fuel making the steel weak and the whole thing buckling even the nist investigations say that it wasn that and it was the subsequent ordinary fire being the reason steel can easily take that kind of heat this isn the first time buildings have caught fire including wtc there was gobs of molten steel at the base nothing not even jet fuel would raise temperatures to melt steel after all the same engine has massive combustion going on during normal operation burning jet fuel for hours on end there was no trace of the aircraft big parts like the engine at the pentagon or at the united site and think even at the wtc this is most suspicious am now convinced that the size of the hole on the side of the pentagon wasn caused by huge jet hitting it the windows survived for example the video shows many many more loose ends and am extraordinarily troubled by this on the flip side this is too coordinated an operation and it requires too many people for cover up so have trouble believing it as such but would very much like answers to these questions and get mad that there are no systematic answers forthcoming from the various powers that be for those of you who dismiss this as left wing anti semitic huh crap don see any real answers forthcoming from you either only abuses address the questions that are technical because they should be somewhat less controversial love to see references and informed discussion and links from experts who don agree with this video analysis so we can setle this matter have been reading up for the last hours and find that the the video raises reasonable doubt my best friend died in these attacks
it easy to understand why use python it flexible easy and powerful in way that cannot be matched by other mainstream languages an article starting this way will hardly see me reading the next sentence unless mainstream languages are just java and php without to mention other languages that may have stranger syntax not be enough oo for people addicted to python and so on what about ruby everybody with some experience with programming languages will recognize in no time that ruby only offers advantages over python

on abu ghraib personally am still unable to get too worked up over what basically amounted to harsh fraternity hazing for terrorists blech he also thinks iraq was an idealistic wilsonian attempt to re make the entire world as safe for liberal democracy while destroying islamic terrorism in the process even the bush administration can really have been so deluded as to think iraq was some kind of harbour for islamic terrorists this guy has some funny ideas
like python too but this article is so bad can barely finish it first in the first paragraph he conflates xml with programming languages shortly thereafter he works in how he is wunderkind that learned programming at age later he refers to the complexity of perl without any specifics perhaps he referring to map which would be ironic in nutshell vague tripe
would consider xslt as programming in xml

yes ruby has advantages like blocks it boils down to taste think you can write code where it is not clear wether you use an attribute or method or whatever rails has_many somethings ruby folks say don care but do care pythons philosophy is explicit is better than implicit this makes for example turbogears little bit more verbose than rails but it makes it easier to understand what is going on

managing pointers for you combined with garbage collection is usually faster than doing it by hand these days for example instead of explicitly deconstructing things in managed languages whole batches of memory are deconstructed at once which is lot faster though it costs little more memory in the long run this trick works because most objects aren around for more than couple of cycles sun keeps inventing fun stuff like this though it takes long while before it shows up in the jvm other managed languages take to such things as well so in general only finely tuned or library goodness ie it still not possible to work with yuv coded signals in java which makes any video work in java much slower as you have to artificially translate yuv to rgb and back just to process the image make faster than managed languages java examples used because most familiar with its guts but it really applies to all managed languages if it aint it probably managed

gt study by the world health organisation found that natural blonds are likely to be extinct within years because there are too few people carrying the blond gene oh no only two centuries of blond jokes left gt according to the who study the last natural blond is likely to be born in finland during is this blond joke how the hell can you calculate this down to an accuracy of one year

gt later he refers to the complexity of perl without any specifics in that paragraph he links to http reddit com info id an article he wrote about why perl is difficult
the article is utterly idiotic and banal imo but suspect many people would take comfort from this kind of conscience salving whether or not you believe the election was rigged lot of americans did vote for bush the second time around think they have been duped by their media because whatever your politics he proved that he was simply not up to the job the first time round and don believe for one minute that americans are more stupid or evil than anyone else sure that people who voted for bush thought they were doing good thing for america and the world the fact that they supported the house of horrors that is abu ghraib torture at guantanamo soviet style arrests of dissidents widespread phone tapping bombing of civilians etc just does not compute for them think the author shows this clearly when he talks about abu ghraib of course he can get worked up about it because as someone who voted for bush has been made complicit_ far easier to say it was just that the good guys tried to spread democracy but it didn work out than to admit you did stupid thing and that bush is not the man that the tv says he is

gt in the first paragraph he conflates xml with programming languages nonsense read it again he uses python and he uses xml he promotes python but he does not promote xml the implication is that it not his habit to promote language just because he uses it but rather because there is something special about it he goes on to explain why he thinks python is special he no doubt mentioned xml because he is famous for promoting rest in preference to rpc think he was the one who started that debate rest typcially uses xml also familiar with his advocacy of svg which is an xml language one might have supposed that he was big fan of xml itself he smart guy and in my opinion he is very clear sighted when it comes to the big picture of things

looked for publication date and the best could find was copyright at the bottom ruby was around of course but had not yet reached wide non japanese audience but of course the larger point is why the comparison is limited to so called mainstream languages get the sense that prescod happened across nice flexible language got comfortable with it and stopped looking for anything better
gt this code was submitted to me as evidence of cool stuff you can do with few lines of perl code well then it not written to be decent code is it any language can be made ugly while compressing program into as few lines of code as possible is an interesting task in itself no one is claiming that it constitutes readable code why the hell is he using code which is designed to be read by computer rather than human as evidence that perl is an ugly language he fails logic
anti capitalist message guess if you look at it in really really shallow way that what you would see in my mind the movie was about the dream of finding the great idea and not having to worry anymore something thought lot of redditors would identify with it rather capitalistic idea isn it of course in the end it pokes you with the fact that all the success and happiness in the world will not bring back the carefree joy of your childhood sad truth think it also saying that once you ve already achieved success you won have that fire in your belly anymore compare einstein working alone in the patent office to einstein in his later years not sure why this film didn touch you haven you ever had the feeling that you ve got the idea and it going to make you rich if you can ever find the time to work on it you know that feeling that makes all the horrors of life worthwhile if you haven then perhaps your existence truly is as grey as that movie was

gt natural blonds are likely to be extinct within years because there are too few people carrying the blond gene little number of people carrying the gene is not reason strong enough to make the gene disappear it can make the gene easier to be extinguished in case of consecutive accidents but it doesn represent reason by itself what matters on the long run is does the gene give its bearer an advantage or disadvantage over other individuals and actually having blond hair seems to give little advantage on finding mate in particular because it an indicator for high oestrogen levels in women

ruby also has its own disadvantages pythonists advocate the idea of there is only one way rubyists advocate tim toady there is more than one way to do it its easier to take collection of python scripts and understand all of them than it is to take collection or ruby scripts and understand all of them assuming each is written by different programmers ruby is also slightly slower and not quite as mature there are both advantages and disadvantes when comparing python and ruby they are very similar in many ways anyway so in my opinion you should use which one fits you best

gt also if you have any exceptions in your you blow your performance due to the requirement that exiting the scope via the exception call the destructors was under the impression that this was common misconception as understand it the runtime performance penalty for an unthrown exception is comparable to conditional checking the return value of function it often times even less than that exceptions in most mainstream compilers are now implemented as jump pads that destruct the stack when they get jumped to jump to the pad is the code that the throw statement actually emits the runtime penalty for thrown exception is obviously high this is one of the reasons using exceptions for non exceptional cases is such bad idea exceptions should rarely be thrown in correctly functioning program implemented as jump pads exceptions can also significantly increase the size of the binary since you end up with very similar code for destructing the same stack in number of places possible cache performance caveat suppose keep in mind that the code should never be using cache space since it should never be executing am under the wrong impression

personally use ruby on rails at my day job am also in the process of learning python from the surface they seem like very similar languages to me but it is also very apparent that they have some radically different design implementations basically would just like to get some input from people who have used or have experience with both languages that can discuss differences similarities and advantages disadvantages of each one

that fuzzy question ruby rails is not quite the same as python by itself rails accomplishes lot of donkey work through code generation this at first seems like great idea except that the generation is one way if you fsck up you have to start over and possibly clobber what changes you ve made to the generated code ruby has slightly more facile support for higher order procedures if you want to generate bunch of procedures classes from pattern in python you have to tinker with internal structures python does pretty well however their approach is to take useful techniques and add explicit support in the language for example if you ve ever read the abelson sussman book or seen the lectures python generators are the streams they talk about in section list comprehensions are very nifty replacement for most of the common looping amp accumulator macros one might write in lisp
gt according to the study north european women evolved blonde hair and blue eyes at the end of the ice age to make them stand out from their rivals at time of fierce competition for scarce males phenomenally inane of the study the point could be made simply blond hair may have become widespread due to sexual selection after population crunch dunno if it true but it doesn offend common sense
when you talk about code generation in ror assume your basing it on the video my experience in using rails is that only the most trivial time saving code generation is used basically just empty classes plus useful folders and that you don run into situations where this causes any problems but maybe using it wrong
thought reddit was supposed to be what new online not what months old online
ok you re right they should be applauded for this but keep in mind that they re all fuckers
it little different in ruby know normally never use blocks and lambdas much in other languages because the core api doesn support them have to write classes and methods that take blocks to start using blocks but ruby core api is filled with methods that take blocks so say that the ruby programmer uses blocks if not more more than other programmers not python experienced but think python ers use list comprehensions frequently where ruby uses array each block python uses listcomps and so on
what would end up happening to java everyone would have to use jython
think how often you use those kind of features is function of how neatly they re incorporated into the language in ruby don use blocks stored in variables procs that often but use anonymous blocks passed to methods all the time and when programming in lisp use lambdas all the time
if you re interested the article about this is on reddit http reddit com goto id ro
that probably it thanks for clarifying the scaffolding is what provoked my old crusty engineer reaction the most expensive mistakes are design bugs calcifiying your classes amp such right at the start usually isn good idea if you mean that in ruby can define generic pattern for function which generates an html tag and use that to make specific functions for each tag using some config file then use those to build bigger abstract chunks then say right on

is it really any more silly than believing that the universe up to and including man was created in seven days by god that upon being discovered by abraham ordered him to kill his only son then proceeded to kill all of the people and animals of the earth except for everyone aboard single ark in flood caused by days and nights of rain and then impegrenated virgin named mary to bring himself to earth to give his true message several thousand years later and then delivered his revised real truth to mohammed on flying horse thousand years after that isn all this mysticism silly couldn south park make every one of the world religions seem ridiculous by illustrating what their scriptures actually say happened
this article has lot of flaws in it for example there are people that obey every law in leviticus they re called orthodox jews though religion is riddled with inconsistencies errors and outright lies it is always easier for true believers to point out the additional inconsistencies of apologists and rationalizers who seek to water faith down the answer drop religion altogether its followers will always hate you study ayn rand philosophy of objectivism and stop apologizing or feeling guilty for something you shouldn

sometimes write drivers for ics so there have been few times where it is necessary to bang the bits as well as maintenance of very old code bases but mostly find myself little more comfortable than others debugging in the source and disassembly window as far as knowing an architecture it can be important but usually the only time ve found it imperative is when writing to device sometimes you have to defeat out of order execution to make sure things get sent in the correct sequence other than that does the trick

openoffice runs acceptably on system with enough memory my argument is that although using languages like python which trade execution speed for programming speed may often be the right choice think it would break down when applied across an entire system in other words it ok for openoffice to be big and bloated because most of the other programs on my system are small and lean if my window manager mail client web browser instant messaging client media player and terminal emulator were all written in languages which made the same tradeoffs as java and python need lot more hardware to do the job horses for courses and all that

lot use list comprehensions in python all the time and would likely use generator expressions just as much if only could rely on python being available everywhere want my code to run don use lambdas much but mostly just because python lambdas are such very weak spot in the language one of very few such really like python used them more before list comprehensions though lambdas combined with map reduce filter are amazingly powerful it just that listcomps do the same things just as powerfully and much more readably blocks still seem weird to me but that may be because don actually use ruby for anything if did fairly sure love them
like it
just saw this article but should have gotten here earlier the comments in this thread are useless go to lte http lambda the ultimate org if you want read more informed discussions about language design
haven used ruby but yeah listcomps are frequently used for iterating through list array and doing something with each item that matches some criterion another common pattern are iterators no end of python classes are written to support the iterator interface so they can be used directly in for loop for instance much much nicer pattern than the totally botched version java got but that almost goes without saying

if she is the last blonde then her mate will inevitably be brown haired making it unlikely that her kids would be blond anyway it possible that he could carry recessive blond gene in which case there chance the offspring would be blond but that is also possible for brown haired people if two brunettes carrying recessive blond genes mate there chance that their offspring will be blond so it wouldn do much good to kill her even after blondes technically go extinct there will likely be odd exceptions popping up possibly in perpetuity since the gene won actually be extinguished from the population

posting thumbnails could pose serious legal issue for reddit given the recent case against google image search believe it was deemed that google use of thumbnails did not constitute fair use
what about design art subreddit that would encompass alot and would be less liable for copyright infringement

like it very nice
the linked site never said it was pal as far as could tell if we assume the author is using us ntsc dvd it would be natively the pixels aren square however so it needs to be upsampled to to have the correct aspect ratio thus the resolution would be appropriate if this is from an ntsc dvd think this was valid comparison
definitely not with fountain pen
linking to photographs does not make one liable for copyright infringement
actually not interested in rating images so much as intrested in posts about photography as craft never liked looking at photographs on screen there something about going to physical space to see real prints that part of the experience of photography plus the gamma on my monitor is way off if reddit is listing of things that are intersting photography reddit com should be listing of things that are interesting about photography dont quite get why topical subreddits are bad idea see reddit blog should this be photographers reddit instead

using all the runway and needing to use all the runway are two quite different things it can be both safer and more efficient to stay on the ground or just off it in ground effect and use your power to accelerate to good low drag climb speed well above stall speed than to force the plane off the ground at low speed halfway down the runway and climb in high drag configuration at little over stall speed this is especally true if there are obstacles to clear or possibility of turbulence it is also more true of pure jet not fan jet or rocket powered aircraft in which the effective power of the engines is nearly directly proportional to their airspeed

uh you might want to study history bit more no puritan but they were certainly persecuted quite heavily throughout europe and in cases that wasn happening they were certainly discriminated against by state run churches such as the church of england do some searching on mary tudor mary of england and the people she killed but its really not suprising that once the puritans did reach america and became political entity themselves with great power that they began misusing it it seems like mixing religion and politics has always been bad mix

the reason the downsampled hd version looks better than the standard dvd one is probably that most dvds are prefiltered to reduce compression artifacts the idea is simple if you blur each frame bit you lower the entropy and can fit scenes into the bitrate available without getting annoying compression artifacts when it comes to fotr the pal verison is less filtered than the ntsc release so it looks better strangely it doesn have more vertical resolution think this is fixed in the two toweers though heres comparison with more analysis http www videophile info review fotr fotr_ htm
gt hosting is still scary exhibit salesforce the blog article makes some good points and this has got to be the most important one think that companies are reluctant to switch to hosted applications because they re reluctant to switch any application now add the fact that the hosting companies are young and unproven and there are few of them think that hosting will not really take off until it is simple and painless to switch hosting companies think this will require standardized platform for hosted applications then we will see divergence of the application host into an application provider and hosting provider then it will be simple to switch hosting providers and move your application and data to new host this would be like building new set of servers and moving your exchange installation to it switching application providers will require converting your data into the format of the new application this would be like switching from exchange to lotus notes hopefully the move to hosted apps will result in an improvement of the administrative tools of our applications the savings in server maintenance will be significant hosting providers will be able to provide more reliability for lower cost through economies of scale the standardized application platform is the key technology to be created the article links to two zdnet blogs that are pure exec speak they refer to web like it is some holy grail hyping it like they did xml so many years ago the word mashup has got to be the most disgusting new term to come out of these people in long time pc magazine and its friends kept their mouth shut about proprietary applications for years pandering to their advertisers the it media is full of hypocrites because they hail mashups but refuse to speak up for the adoption of openness for fear of offending their advertisers amazon is brilliant for offerring an api into their product database we need other online companies to provide similar apis skype msn messenger aol im newegg etc the zdnet people use their marketing jargon like innovation from the bottom up so they don have to say trust other coders what it really comes down to is trust and security only company that does something well and feels confident in its technical position will be able to open up its data and cooperate with their potential competitors think that execs in most companies have an innate distrust of coders hackers especially ones that don work for them they re so focused on making money that they miss opportunites to let their company product become an important part of somebody else product stopped reading it trade magazines around because they never cited the instability of the applications they reviewed piece of software would get star recommendation but crash when try to use it ok really must go to sleep now another evening wasted on reddit

as someone who interested in photography but not enough to regularly check seperate page about it worried that this development will lead to less photography related links on the main page more generally it seems that subreddits will suck content of their sort from the main page understand that the recommended page may solve this in an ideal world but to me for now and no offense intended it not functional sure the folks running this site are considering possible solutions ie including highly rated subreddit items on the main page maybe allowing control of this to the users preference and curious to hear them especially before give my feedback on subreddits

have mixed feelings about this article agree that aid given to african governments is largely wasted but don agree that free trade is the solution this is because africa will always be at disadvantage in this sphere the west used protectionism over the past or so years to build up its industries and now that this is no longer an appropriate policy it advocates selective free trade this hypocrisy needs to be challenged but in free trade environment africa will never be able to build the industrial capacity to compete with developed economies and will remain an exporter of raw materials and talented people the solution is to devolve aid and assistance away from governments and down to grassroots level right across africa millions of people are involved in organisations striving to improve their rights these include trade unions church groups community organisations and so on they are generally membership based democratic and almost all massively under resourced they promote everything from fair labour standards freedom of expression to organic farming to women health and need to be supported the west which owes huge debt to africa for building up its wealth over the past years of colonialism should create no strings attached fund that is rigorous in its selection process but autonomous of any government influence this money should go directly to the people on the ground who are making difference much more important than financial aid though is actually listening to these people giving them platform and voice and lobbying for their point of view in international forums mayibuye afrika

sure is pretty like the urls being defined at the top instead of having to monkey around with them in another file like rails another thing like about this is it isn unnecessarily broken down in rails the code section itself would be broken down into different sections due to rails model view controller mvc approach this always seemed pretty unnecessary to me as its often very debatable whether your code belongs in the controller or the model find actually will work in both of them does anyone know if there are any disadvantages to using two pronged approach code and view instead of mvc granted this is pretty small app but it is very intuitively done what templating engine is it using that the only part of it really don like

the paragraph on performance isn that good in the beginning he only talks about startup time not general performance then he claims that ie is faster at rendering simple and small pages which is definitely not an interesting issue because that where performance does not matter many of the other myths are not myths but rather inaccurate claim the answer is always not true only true there also just sources for the claims being refuted but no sources for the counter claims
return to this work again and again and again and again it is the ultimate self help book in my opinion
completely agree with you on this it the bad part about polyphasic sleep did equal sleep sessions almost without fail for year of college but that because it fit my schedule well
we run into this problem constantly it not easy think in startup you need more than one founder and your cofounder should be someone you ve known for while ideally years but at least months so if none of your friends will start company with you you have to make more friends judging from past startups there are three places where that happens at school google at work hotmail and in user groups lotus perhaps now there will start to be fourth open source projects the best bet seems to be school if were and wanted to start startup go to the best college could and once there recruit the best hacker could find probably someone older since most fellow freshmen would be leery of dropping out to start company

when read that took it as hyperbole that said the big complaint he has about perl is that the development mindset the language encourages leads to code that is difficult to maintain will not argue about how awesome cpan is but how many difficult maintenances does it take before the advantages are lost obviously there are only two cases where this is valid bad programmers through lack of time or just plain ineptitude or hard problems either way there is usually spot of code in any sizeable project that is an ugly mess

while agree that ideally there should be more than one founder totally understand this guy situation got my interest in technology while growing up in small technology focused town in socal constantly toy around with any new tech that could get my hands on and learn as much as possible regardless of what my capabilities were expected to be limited to at that age eventually though moved to small town on the east coast there went to small private school were had maybe one or two good science teachers but not much else eventually got used to the idea that learning anything new is my job doing well in school will be no excuse to be incompetent in your future career back in socal when dive deep into some technical challenge felt as though was part of close group that was racing to achieve something great in the places ve lived since then it seems as though the only person that interested at all at the university go to now can count the number of capable people on two fingers and thats pushing it seriously just no one cares no one sees themselves going beyond the traditional employment routes to achieve some amazing even if over ambitious goals my highly valuable advice to you is to just go for it be flexible in what your company provides and since you probably won hit it big until your at least in college don make the mistake that many of us have take at least little bit of time to chose school that will have many smart people around while not overloading you with work any other lone hackers out there that want to team up

the reason why the number of blondes will decrease is that the gene for blondeness is recessive it assumes that blondes will intermarry with non blondes as an example suppose percent of the people in the world were blonde with blonde genes and non blonde with no blonde genes of the genes are blonde if people marry at random there will be blondes non blondes with blonde gene and of people with no blonde gene if each set of parents had kids the number of blondes would have dropped fold there no reason for blondes to disappear entirely though as long as out of genes is for blondeness one would expect an average of at least blonde in population of billion

gt the language encourages leads to code that is difficult to gt maintain gt obviously there are only two cases where this is valid gt bad programmers through lack of time or just plain gt ineptitude or hard problems hope you were being sarcastic because that not only not right it isn even wrong language syntax alone can lead to hard to maintain code by necessity through forcing you to write code that is difficult to read dig into any of the old non freeform languages that used to be popular in the days of punch card input for examples language semantics can lead to even more insidious difficulties steve yegges complains about perl references in that rant of his and having fought with them myself can only agree with him references like pointers are inane they force you to think about how the computer physically manages your data structures when you could just be thinking about how to structure your data instead even language customs can lead to hard to maintain code ve never written or even read any code but nonetheless ve had to quietly suffer no end of rants about how horrible the stl is to work with and how you definitely shouldn even think about using something else in its stead and yada yada that not even the fault of proper and it still impacts maintainability of code language design has tremendous impact on code maintainability quite apart from programmer ability or problem difficulty if it didn we might as well all just write machine code or unlambda or brainfuck hlls were invented for reason
reddit is actually great example of the sort of site that he talking about reddit seems to be trying the google model of coming in as ultra lightweight and full of nothing but functionality hoping to build enough of userbase that they can flip it to buyer on the premise that they can turn those users into profit it won happen once you set the bar for site like this as zero ads zero cost your userbase comes to expect and demand it if reddit tries to switch invariably reddit ripoffs would appear and the community would swarm away it sad situation

for gene being recessive does not imply being weaker if there is no difference looking at the fitness of blondes and non blondes the distribution of genotypes will remain more or less constant as consequence the same holds for the distribution of the phenotypes the number of blondes ps there is also no single gene for blondeness guess so everything here is simplification
minimal you obviously don have an hdtv set not really sure what the point of the linked page is as it vastly downsizing hdtv how in the world does that demonstrate the quality if you want good comparison look at or image and upsample the dvd frame to that it ll be much much more evident there is huge quality difference between hdtv and dvd after watching even network television shows in hdtv csi and without trace being good ones going back to standard definition is like putting some blurry glasses on it really is remarkable
deal with companies every day who have no qualms about charging cents to send characters of data from one person to another or who have no problems charging for kb gif image or bad midi version of popular song or even up to for small java clone of tetris year old game yeah and that industry sucks if that what you want to happen to the web you re jerk luckily it won happen since people on the web won put up with nearly as much shit as mobile users
users shouldn blame the low visual quality of ntsc dvds on the dvd standard itself pal has only more pixels yet you re talking like they re night in day on the flip side pal sacrifices colour clarity talking about the pal wire standard and lowers the frequency to hz so it hardly panacea sorry ll take an ntsc set any day of the week furthermore when they make dvds they have fixed volume of space to fill so they set the compression ratio accordingly leading to some fast action scenes looking like sheeit or evidence of posterization pal having more pixels doesn magically mean there more capacity on the disc it simply means that they have to turn compression up even more to fit it on the disc just like the ntsc vs pal wire standard the resolution of pal on fixed bandwidth medium isn the win win you seem to think it is
which only proves that you are as ignorant as rep ron hood

wish more people would come to this realization acegopher it funny many traditional conservative positions small government opposition to publicly funded welfare are predicated in part on the assumption that people are fundamentally selfish and will work to gain power money etc at cost to other people this is different than the perspective of the republican party currently disclaimer not saying dems aren guilty just focusing on the gop for now the current republican stance seems to be that other people are self interested but that we gw his cronies senators governors etc are not and that the gop only has america best interests at heart
lets look at the real merits behind these laws gays would teach adoptee to be open and experimental to protect rights of others and to cherish people who different republicans would teach adoptee to god fearing and refer back often on book inspired by an invisible diety to protect the rights of only those who follow the same book and to fear those who are different which society would you like to live in

they had multimillion buyout offer from google already what don understand is why they didn take it don see how site like reddit could grow to be worth more than that when it easy to clone and doesn generate enough value to pay for
why not in the open court system why behind the bar of hidden tribunal aren we treading dangerously close to soviet russia where you must just simply trust the collective good will
what your source ve heard that there been buyout offer but heard it described as lowball with no amount
that kind of his point if web users won put up with as much shit as mobile users it not viable business price is way of gauging service actual value to people anyone will come visit random website because it doesn cost them anything but to make people actually pay for service requires that you deliver value in excess of what they re paying it way of keeping businesses honest and making sure they re actually delivering something useful rather than an odd nifty diversion

gt if there is no difference looking at the fitness of blondes and non blondes the distribution of genotypes will remain more or less constant but according to the original study the enviornment has changed in several ways there is no longer significant shortage of males bleached blondes are now on average and according to the study statistics preferable for mating over natural blondes gt for gene being recessive does not imply being weaker as far as genes go being recessive definitely does make it weaker how is my math wrong or just press the down arrow that works edit oh you meant that it doesn make the person less fit to reproduce got it
we don know what causes homosexuality but don think it reasonable yet to conclude that there certain gene that is related know at least one pair of identical twins where one is gay and the other is not however it is certainly not valid to equate homosexuality with feminism women professionals that would be like saying eventually there will be no more popes because the pope cannot have children
and you would have us believe that they were convicted murderers it doesn matter what they were you re supposed to have to prove it before you lock someone away for years and years and once you lock them up you re supposed to treat them humanely no obviously they have figured out way so that this is not de facto required but it is still antithetical to american mores and values think that alberto gonzales belongs in the international criminal court but actually let him have trial even though we all know what he done
feminism isn genetic it belief not primal urge while can see your point that feminist mother is likely to indoctrinate her daughters with similar ideals many children develop their beliefs as backlash against what they see around them rather than falling to the rhetoric presented to them it common to rebel against one parents ideals simply for the sake of rebelling so feminists are always likely to develop from families where the mother takes particularly subservient role

this is true but hardly surprising they re not going to come out and say we honestly couldn give shit about any of you we re just trying to put foward our political agenda and to earn ourselves place in the history books any party has to appear to care about the greater good on somewhat unrelated note think that both republicans and democrats are sufficiently right wing that they both work on the assumption that people are inherently selfish only the idealists on the far left credit people with any degree of integrity and we ve all seen where that got them

we do not tread anywhere close to soviet russia because there is no evidence we are regularly putting mass quantities of citizens into anything resembling what the gulag was or any citizens for that matter terrorists should be treated as less than properly badged enemy combatants they cannot possibly be allowed the same access and privilege to defense that suspect criminal citizens do it is important to recognize that dealing with terrorism is military matter and not of civilian nature to bring them before court the same way citizen could be is to give them full attorney client privilege and full unfettered access to the prosecution evidence when dealing with military combatants who do not play by the rules you simply cannot have system which allows the suspects to plot scheme and communicate with their organization unmonitored through the lawyer nor can you be revealing names and identities of informants in open court most of these informants and their evidence comes from intelligence organizations whose mere revelation can sometimes compromise their cover and efforts note the distinction between citizens and non citizens in trying civilian government can guarantee to reasonable extent the safety of witnesses government also has tools to deal with domestic organizations to alleviate the fear of the suspect communicating with their brothers in crime these safeguards do not exist with foreigners who have zero respect for international law and who have access to foreign military organizations if they are truly innocent fair military tribunal will see to their exoneration

being recessive doesn make gene weaker in the sense that it does nothing to lessen the likelihood of the person carrying it surviving or reproducing thus being recessive does not cause reduction of the gene presence in the genepool if gene lessens one chances of surviving or reproducing when it is expressed then would expect being recessive to make the gene stronger
omg that fuckin funny
gt it is important to recognize that dealing with terrorism is military matter and not of civilian nature are you simple was there military tribunal for timothy mcveigh that is completely arbitrary distinction if you can get politicians and everyone else really to stop calling things people terrorism terrorists for any reason whatever then your position could begin to make sense but that is not the case obviously terrorism can be either civilian or military gt note the distinction between citizens and non citizens in trying civilian government also has tools to deal with domestic organizations huh that sounds like the distinction between civilians and non civilians and foreign and domestic organizations what does that have to do with the difference between citizens and non citizens oh right people think it ok to deny the bill of rights to non citizens that is the only distinction you are actually making gt if they are truly innocent fair military tribunal will see to their exoneration and how can we make it fair

if people perceive my previous email as anti religious or anti gay apologize it wasn meant to be negative against either upon reading it again can see why it looks that way de modding myself again my bad support both people should be free to practice either thing am concerned with is when someone attempts to places their specific world views on everyone else for instance it is common knowledge some world religions have it written in their holy text against homosexuality usually sending those who practice homosexuality to the deepest of their hells now the original bill to banish adoptions for the gays seems to be heavily linked to this idea
guess the first step to religious persecution was the war on christmas
it would have been lot more effective it it had banned divorced people from adopting children most arguments against gay adoption run along religious and traditional family lines yet divorce is also sin according to the bible and shatters many more families than homosexuality by listing republicans in the bill it can be written off as cheap political attack by listing divorced people it might have made few people think
actually that what makes religious ideas so dangerous you re not allowed to question they call it dogma for reason for example thinking that native americans are desentants of jewish tribes is stupid but you can question it if you re on an lds trip

not saying there is no genetic influence my point was just that homosexuality could be caused by the interaction of multiple factors in which case it is much less likely to disappear from the population however just because there genetic influence does not mean that the gene will eventually die out due to lack of reproduction as you pointed out the prenatal hormonal theory could explain the biological origin of homosexuality however according to this theory homosexuality results from an interaction of genes with the environment in which case there would be many people with the homosexuality susceptibility gene who were not exposed to the particular hormones in the womb to make them express those genes therefore the genes will persist

it doesn make the genotype weaker it can make the phenotype weaker consider an isolated group of only blondes making up of the world population as they interbreed only with each other all their children are blonde for total of of the world population now consider what happens if they mingle with the rest of the world all of whom for the sake of argument have brown haired genes if you are one of these blonde people you have only chance of finding another blonde to mate with and having blonde kid the other of the world will automatically have brunettes thus only of the next generation is blonde then it in the next generations in the one after that and so on you can see why they predict extinction however that does not mean the gene has become extinct assuming equal fitness the absolute proportion of the gene in the population should remain the same instead of of the population having blonde genes would have one and you would get spontaneous blondes popping up when two carriers interbred since in people carries recessive blonde gene you expect an eventual frequency of in or about actually that would alter the numbers bit and make the pendulum swing back but the equilibrium should be about blonde population with another carrying recessive blonde gene phenotypically it died out somewhat but genotypically it identical

would agree that is one of the core principles of christianity very noble one truly respect that wouldn you agree that there other writing in the bible that contradict that core belief trying not to be offensive but to get point across in the bible story about sodom and gomorrah two cities smited by the lord usually cited when explaining why homosexuality is wrong with this story one can reason those who are gay will be smited by the lord it seems justifies mistreatments if the almighty is doing it why can we

so basically what you are saying is that it is no longer necessary for gay people to hide their gayness by having children with straight people because it is socally acceptable to be gay in some parts of the world even if that is the case and homosexuality is genetic don think that it would be bred out for two reasons lesbians can still have children with donated sperm know many lesbian couples who have had children this way gay men can and do donate sperm to sperm banks for both straight and gay women to use as matter of fact some of those lesbians that know that had children spcfically sought out sperm donor who was gay so no don think homosexuality will be bred out

gt whether there gay gene isn relevant if there any genetic basis for homosexuality and lack of oppression means they don have sham marriages that result in children then gay rights fewer gays not necessarily even if there is strong genetic factor involved many homosexuals are now having children of their own either gay men finding surrogate mothers or lesbians artificially inseminating themselves suspect that this trend is likely to increase

gt was there military tribunal for timothy mcveigh that is completely arbitrary distinction allow me make clear distinction in the example you provided with timothy mcveigh the individuals at guantanamo bay were captured on foreign soil in recognized theater of military conflict and were foreign agents timothy mcveigh status fulfilled none of these conditions gt that sounds like the distinction between civilians and non civilians and foreign and domestic organizations thank you for catching my civilian citizen mixup meant to assign the statement to non civilians non civilians captured in military operation should not receive the full breadth of judicial oversight that civilians do there is clearly necessary separation of powers where the executive branch when exercising its war powers cannot have every action possibly scrutinized and struck down by the judicial branch

why are you making the link between feminism priests and homosexuality feminists and priests nuns are products of cognitive choices perhaps their disposition is in someway influenced by genetics but ve never heard feminist priest or nun say didn choose to be feminist priest nun its who am think those three are higher level social effects then homosexuality just because they all don like to make babys doesn mean they all came about the same way agree with your logic on gay rights could equal fewer gays although what about test tube babies or surrogates but don think you can extend the arguement to other groups of people that choose to put themselves in positions where they will not reproduce

just some example categories but if we re going to be splitting the site up into sub reddits you might as well make it possible to post in multiple sections at once
it all economics some markets such as reddit like sites are flooded with free sites and are no longer viable business other markets such as online retail have healthy amount of competition so you don have to put up with shit but there can also be viable business then there the mobile phone ring tone market where cell phone megacorps have used copyright and closed delivery platforms to limit competition and get people to pay ridiculous amounts of money for images and ring tones
think this was brilliant they didn do anything stupid like break the law and didn intentionally harm anyone they were following the law just to show how ridiculous it is good stuff
would argue that finding great business partner is explained by the same economic principles as buying used car they re both lemon markets just like you don know what kind of car you re buying until you own it its very hard to know how good partner is until you re working with him or at least good friends with him ve experienced this myself in my efforts to find good hackers partners here at uva although ve gotten lot of interest from my facebook ads it has been very difficult to discern who has the skills passion necessary to dedicate to potential project this information asymmetry seems to be huge constraint on potential startups think of how many more partnerships would be possible if you were not restricted to those you knew intimately an interesting thought finding good business partner is lot like finding good life partner you really have to get to know him her over several months before you can have any concept as to whether the partnership will be successful sigh at least the dating market is more evolved
thinking that the best partners are those that have completely different but complementing tasks while still having good knowledge of how the other job works this way has many benefits each person can boast about his accomplishments neither can slack and make the other do everything oh hey maybe it is like dating just get employees on job to job basis no long term commitment less expensive in the long term too kidding kidding

gt ok so you were wrong when you said dealing with terrorism is military matter and not of civilian nature glad we could clear that up good catch should have been more clear and stated that was directing my attention to terrorism involving foreign actors because as you have indicated it is of different matter than when it occurs domestically and concede the point to you that while it is obvious the al qaeda detainees are suspected terrorists the same cannot be said for the taliban detainees there are only marginally better by being unlawful combatants however your nuance implies that there are only two possible treatments in the current prosecution of guantanamo detainees by the american government criminally with the full rights afforded to the accused by the constitution or as bona fide prisoners of war with the full rights accorded to them as the american government has agreed to in its treaties and through international law if that implication is correct then wholeheartedly disagree there is certainly class or even classes of combatants who are not behaving to the high bar international law demands for classification as prisoners of war but who are certainly non civilian militants international law is clear on this matter when you engage in warfare that specifically targets civilians or hides behind them as targets you have forfeited certain legal protections and privileges including status

find this to be mildly unlikely because of historical argument homosexuality was wildly popular to the point where it was equally normal to find males and females attractive if you were male but greece continued for probably about thousand years in this state and in fact grew to be reasonably sized empire at several points am under the impression that pressures of sexual selection on genetics generally take slightly shorter than that to take effect
correct me if wrong but didn washington cross the icy waters of the potomac something that doesn happen quite as often these days would europe mini ice age have affected the us as well or could we simply say it was natural cycle unaffected by by man or the lack thereof in this case

love this town and great site
you are operating under the same mentality as other commenters to the article have that there are only two options citizens under criminal courts and under geneva do you recognize third category of detained individuals who do not fit into either category if not then how do you explain the historic treatment of pirates brigands and spies also if you could please provide reference to something showing that citizens are being held as detainees in guantanamo would be most appreciative can seem to find anything credible on the topic
so it wiki
watch out for the marimba phenomenon http www joelonsoftware com items html
it completely against the law in some states it be illegal for obstructing traffic in other states it would be illegal use of the passing lanes delighted that someone would highlight the inanity and of our traffic laws but rather dismayed that they choose such reckless way to do it it looks like no one got hurt directly but they could have done real damage to someone stuck in that traffic jam they ll never know
methinks ham radio will never be mainstream enough to satisfy the majority of bloggers and am ham operator not to mention you need special equipment and how would blogging work that way do you mean like podcast or data using packet radio with all the wireless networking gear availble now would guess that lots indy wireless networks would pop up everywhere and many would link themselves together to form replacement network
yep pretty worried about that but hope made it clear that this is very early
it looks like wiki blog hybrid right now but these are smart guys don think they expect to make money off something that just yet another hosted wiki blog site
with new feature every day expect something specatular soon
don think aaron comments really count as big marketing effort up front the merger entry this links to has practically zero hype think the amount of early attention on infogami has been pretty healthy
there were many days when felt like my head was going to literally explode what like in scanners
my guess is that it will wiki fy the entire web stack despite appearing bit bare currently it did add on the ability to edit the site template right in the wiki which hadn seen in any others yet so maybe it ll do the same for url mapping data modelling and other aspects
hmm seems kinda lame especially with google pages having launched in the past couple days
yeah was underwhelmed too pbwiki already offers everything infogami does and more http pbwiki com for it to stand out from the wiki crowd infogami should have done something novel like don know subetha style collaborative editing page done in ajax and not even an rss feed on the development blog lame
put in request http infogami reddit com hopefully ll have rss feeds done tomorrow
that the key point of marimba phenomenon don launch too early

great things must be expected of infogami after all aaron swartz is the only guy introduced in the fogcreek intern movie with bell ringing in the background btw what is the markdown thing for an attempted joke
what to do hehe leave them alone it free country wont get in their way of life liberty or property and expect the same from them so long as their bad ideas dont get in the way of my work tolerate personaly don do the whole personal surrender to outside authority thing but other people can if they want some religious ideas are as dangerous as they are bad but the more you fight with them the more they infect the people who believe them so you work around it you listen you teach and you work real problems don get solved by prayer but by hard work and dedication of able minds there lot of good to do in this world cures to be found products to be made software to be written the religious can have whatever flavor of pat robertson their group requires he and his bad ideas are only going to slow them down give it some time it not like it big deal that everyone is atheist about thor zeus or mars anymore
in fact everything was so spot in that wondered if microsoft actually does that it been so long since ve bought any software product in box that that trend could have certainly sneaked in
disagree this video seems typical of cops around the world in my life experiences any time you debate cop they feel threatened and will act accordingly ve found it the rare cop who has it together to handle banter besides they re not trained to debate the merits of an argument they re trained to protect the public by upholding the law sometimes that protection thing is confused with status and law is restraint by which they re annoying bound don debate cops under any circumstance take it to your politicians

the pie fallacy can remember believing as child that if few rich people had all the money it left less for everyone else many people seem to continue to believe something like this well into adulthood this fallacy is usually there in the background when you hear someone talking about how percent of the population have percent of the wealth if you plan to start startup then whether you realize it or not you re planning to disprove the pie fallacy http www paulgraham com wealth html it sounds benevolent to say we ought to reduce economic inequality when you phrase it that way who can argue with you inequality has to be bad right it sounds good deal less benevolent to say we ought to reduce the rate at which new companies are founded and yet the one implies the other http www paulgraham com inequality html

not sure what it is you re disagree with never said that sort of behavior is uncommon just that it gives cops bad name as for debate it fine if they re unwilling to debate and quite few of the cops shown were professional about it the correct response is sorry we don have complaint forms can take your complaint direct you to the appropriate supervisor etc those cops only got couple seconds each on the video being confrontational with someone who obviously isn doing anything wrong and already has complaint about your department is totally unacceptable
infogami seems subtly different from wiki think it is more like backpack perhaps somewhere in between wiki and backpack with little work this would be perfect for creating and managing personal web sites mean web sites for typical users not web geeks not sure if markdown is simple enough for that market but it is good start

genetic drift http en wikipedia org wiki genetic_drift will do it gt given sufficiently long time however the mathematics of genetic drift cf random walk predict the allele will either die out or be present in of the population after which time there is no random variation in the associated gene in this regard genetic drift tends to sweep gene variants out of population over time in the absence of some opposing process it becomes statistically inevitable see also http www talkorigins org faqs genetic drift html edit this was in regard to the bottom paragraphs not the feasibility of the prediction

if the europeans don change the rules and start looking after the natives they will face extinction and it as simple as that fukuyama was accurate in that europe should have addressed this problem decades ago and has largely missed the boat he frowns upon the nationalist approach which includes isolationism protectionism and religious revival but it is the only viable option on the table europe and america wanted all the benefits of society where morality and ethnic awareness take back seat to economic prosperity and social experimentation and none of the downsides well the chickens have come home to roost now haven they with you though if somebody has better idea on how to reverse the impending death of western civilization let hear it even if the muslim presence in europe wasn an issue europe would still be headed for suicide the birth rate is well below replacement levels and hear that some nations require immigration by the millions each year just to keep their economies from shrinking italy and spain come to mind america is not far behind our prostitution of immigrant and migrant hispanics and refusal to procreate is only going to go so far before social unrest becomes an issue as it has in europe

microsoft sell more software than apple because they have an effective monopoly on desktop and office productivity software making them the de facto standard that people must interoperate with and then try as hard as they can to keep their protocols and interfaces secret to prevent anyone else from interoperating with them look at an area where they don have stranglehold already like web servers itunes type online stores etc and you ll see that apple and open source software with fraction of microsoft advetising budget or no advertising at all is regularly eating their lunch

gt made it sound like huge invention that would revolutionize the internet haven you heard that what web is but really think aaronsw has always had big head his comments are more or less along the lines of insert app here is the greatest thing out there gt unfortunately this amazing system is pretty much invisible to the outside world but it going to allow us to quickly build software that more advanced than anything else out there infogami gt python on the other hand has problems of its own the biggest is that it has dozens of web application frameworks but none of them are any good pythonists are well aware of the first part but apparently not of the second since when tell them that using my own library the universal response is don think python needs another web application framework yes python needs fewer web application frameworks but it also needs one that doesn suck he then continues on into how why his framework fixes all the problems web py anyway for some guys the arrogance works larry wall others not so much any number of internet programmers who thought they were something but still nobody has any clue who they are the main problem is don see clear audience for infogami the kind of people that visit reddit generally aren going to use it and your everyday joe isn ever going to hear about it
wildly unsubstantiated rumours of course but interesting stuff wouldn put it past them some analysis here http www dadmobile com trawler
imo we need more general programming subreddit before we get something like this
stories about which already said that don like them are obviously not recommendable

suspect that subreddits will eventually lead to tags so you would be able to tag url with cs programming and whatever else you want with reasonable mechanism for promoting and demoting urls with respect to subset of their tags there may not be need to keep the number of subreddits small in such scenario there would be no need to suggest subreddits at all
yes it could be argued it illegal to drive faster than the speed limit
see no real problem with the current crossposting of articles that pertain to more than one subreddit as is done now the key to this is not creating too many subreddits that would overlap to further jesusphreak idea if we were to make subreddit on programming it should cover material that is not already well covered by the main reddit perhapse an in depth functional programming reddit since those usually score low or python cookbook reddit
think it was very clever they should do it like times week then maybe it will make difference
would like that
could you elaborate why is it important to avoid overlap when promoting demoting browsing urls you would specify one or more tags
in london as well we re talking about ontario right
or live chat reddit since you replied to my comment in about seconds haha its important to avoid overlap because then submitter would end up posting everything to several subreddits and this would diminish the value of having subreddits in the first place they would all end up very similar
what do you know about rss
these are great
so how do you get that don influence each other part right in the real world kill off the financial press
so what if for example programming and cs subreddits tags have lots of overlap as long as you allow people to promote demote urls with respect to multiple tags then there should not be problem when browsing you could specify whatever tag you want
brilliant idea to jumpstart with existing reddit users now the question is if you can get enough small services to federate their userbases like adultkey amp such once again porn showed us the way
what the difference between crossposting to multiple usenet newsgroups and to multiple reddits as the number of users scales up suspect there will be no difference between the two at all cross posting will be considered spamming
key quality of reddit is that its interface is very simple there are more complex interfaces out there but the simplicity of two arrows makes reddit somewhat unique tags would add whole other level of work in setting organizing one favorites
fucking spam
reddit penalizes spam so cross posting or using multiple tags would be quite acceptable
exactly we don want to be deprived of interesting relavent links because the submitter was afraid to post to too many groups
what the diff between the two
yes tags would add new level of complexity but they might be better than some arbitrary selection of subreddits
just watched huge show on the history channel about the little ice age and oddly enough all of the theories it presented dealt more with the little ice age starting then th black plauge coming on ship from asia and the little ice age contributing to the high death rates of the plague there were three theories put forth for the start of the little ice age on the show none of them had it started due to the plague this link gives an overview of the show it was pretty good http store aetv com html product index jhtml id
when you spam reddit people will demote your urls thus making it less likely that your future url submissions will end up as recommendation for them this in turn reduces the chances that you can spread news in the future since fewer people will likely see your url this penalty for spamming applies to crossposting also so crossposting should not be problem
agreed reddit should just examine this and other methods carefully so as to avoid coming off as cheep clone of the other tagging sites out there
think now understand the difference between usenet groups and subreddits usenet groups didn have ranking system here if you post your story to irrelevant subreddits you will find yourself modded down in them one crucial capability we would need with these subreddits is duplication removal does reddit already do this if ve hidden reddit com info id do is sub reddit com info id hidden from me
just saying that deciding on all the groups to post to that is if their are many similar groups places heavier burden on the the submitter this burden is quite light with the current system
removed
my guess is yes more difficult problem is handling the reccomendations across subreddits though how would reddit best do this
the submitter can pick whatever tags he she wants others could later submit the same url with other tags and be rewarded for it
agree merging this thread with http request reddit com info id cdh df sorry about the crosstalk
but would this come too close to being delicous clone
word is over on scoble blog that the video actually came from microsoft
tags subreddits seem like stopgap solution if we had good recommendation engine we wouldn need tags or perhaps tags could be aids to the recommendation engine hmm
well you never know what del icio us will do it might be that both services will eventually converge to something similar but so what
but enjoy several non related fields soccer and functional programming for example don want people reccomendations from one influencing the reccomendations get in another for obvious reasons
gt ability to download mp you uploaded to ipod no eh can get the mp put on my ipod back off my ipod what do you mean if you re using some kind of digital restrictions mangment then you can complain
del icio us is already huge and has heavy financial backing do we really want to fight them at their own game
don understand if they re unrelated there unlikely to be overlap between them anyway right what meant was that tags could help recommendation engine instead of like delicious inbox where you have to specify what tags you care about you leave it up to the great algorithm in the sky and it can be arbitrarily smart about using all the information about post all the tags and all the comments and the identities of people who posted in deciding if you ll be interested
yes hmmm for large faced paced threads like this think it would be useful if reddit had bar on the right side that could list the most recent comments on the page you could just click the link and jump right to the comment good idea
good point the recomendation engine is in sore need of some improvements perhapse the arrows alone are not enough data for effective recomendation in the first place
yeah one better an interface like gmail where the most recent comments bubble to the top but attached to their threads context especially if modding things up down makes them read think this would mix nicely with the current ordering algorithm nice chat timg perhaps we should exchange cards at http www cs utexas edu akkartik back to the topic at hand
maxpages com was allowing users to build sites online in sure its currently very cheesy but for their time maxpages were magnitudes further ahead of the pack then infogami currently is time will tell
ah yes let me prepare my card ha thought you were my friend karthik from here for second after seeing that yes the google groups active older topics panel is just like what imagining now that think about it
yeah hadn seen that google groups panel before just like that except part of my point was that perhaps we don even need two panels we already have the main panel being sorted by date and mod points think adding read unread state and the ability to collapse parents would mix well with this
there is time and place for everything once every month there is time when woman experiences physical internal change feminine mystery that no man can ever fully comprehend but at this time in her cycle you notice emotional changes too symptoms of near psychosis that make you question her sanity and keeps the letter word close to your lips you know it her time of the month but the question is how to keep this seemingly temporarily bi polar woman in her place and how you can get through her pms without having to go mia
guess you didn read the linked article where swartz explains that basically none of the features are implemented yet right now it just an infrastructure
comment folding would be good haven seen that in many discussion boards either running with the google groups example for gg when you view topic you can only see maybe comments per page in the frames view this has the advantage in that only that many messages are marked as viewed which is especially useful in large thread that you have to take break from reading and come back to later aside from this problem with overmarking of comments as viewed think that this is good idea simple color change at the header of the comment would work this was mentioned in another thread somewhere around here think the reddit guys should go for it one more thing the minimum width on these comments needs to be increased just bit wait know

horrible fuckin title
where does wrongful arrest get decided not out in the highway that for sure my point is this when cop comes to your car or door and tells you you re doing something wrong that is prob not the right time to disagree with them not because they hold gun or anything but just because they re trained not to let us civilians change their minds this training is there for reason otherwise cops would be getting into arguments with lawyers all over our roads the cop follows his training and the judge later decides the law that the division of labour
if they wanted to make point they should have waited for police officer to come up behind them and then get in formation unable to speed up even tho he wanted to pass them until he turned on his lights all they did there was make life hell for lot of other people who also felt the speed limit was ridiculous if they wanted to make people call and complain there are better ways than antagonizing them but then it was probably more about this cool video than standing up for something if they might get in trouble
big head yes reinventing the wheel all over the place yes are these bad not entirely despite the old myths of insert latest programming fad making software completely reusable and flexible often times it is better just to start over from what ve seen aaron projects have demonstrated clear improvements over existing technology this is what pushes the improvement of even the dustiest code as for the big head stuff its not my style but he more or less backs it up maybe some of us should be more boastful when we deserve it
unfortunately you guys are both right infogami is just an in place csm for wiki blog sites guessing the pinnacle will be graphical drag and drop interface for modifying page layouts maybe we re missing something

apparently enough that people will pay for it more to the point it something that other people can duplicate easily because cell services have control of the network and so they can keep competition from driving the price down
my guess is that sun doesn want htx because numa systems built from htx slot interconnects will make their high end kit look bit overpriced by comparison
so they could acquire the founders of said site programmers who have track record of being able to deliver product that people will use given that google market cap is mil employee the two reddit founders would actually be worth somewhat less than the average google employee
nothing like patting yourself on the back eh

think to some degree starting startup requires big head the vast majority of startups fail believing yours won implies you think you re somehow better than most of the other people with startups on the other hand it requires being humble enough to notice when it becomes apparant that your original idea is flawed to take advice from other smart people and make the changes required for success

live in portland oregon there is group of bike riding nutjobs that will occassionally go en masse on the freeway traffic is stalled by it and there are never enough cops to hunt them all down when the police do respond have always wanted few of those rubber pellet grenades for exactly that kind of thing demonstrations are fine but make sure they target the people who are causing the problem not those who suffer from it
what perfect way to avoid writing my thesis
and if you slowed down just little while driving on the freeways you see some of those tiny markers indicating fatal accidents people year in america alone and the number is actually rising like it or not they were driving slow and safe and the response they got by fellow motorists was insanity its like the old saying speed kills but it gets you there faster
costly user defined function calls are side effect of some of the language design decisions yes it sucks yes it should be fixed but considering some of the other areas that have been optimized think the better trade offs were made
hrm seeing as those bike riding nutjobs are usually doing it memory of bikers killed because motorists didn share the road say they re pretty effective wouldn you senzei
this reminds me of the whole thing that was made up about the poor kuwaiti rape vicitim who testified before congress in the lead up to first iragi war when will we ever learn to ask questions
the ny times reports that the canadian health care system is impoding http cafehayek typepad com hayek the_death_of_th html this is country in which dogs can get hip replacement in under week and in which humans can wait two to three years but there is some good news for canadians needing medical services the country publicly financed health insurance system frequently described as the third rail of its political system and core value of its national identity is gradually breaking down private clinics are opening around the country by an estimated one week and private insurance companies are about to find gold mine
we ll see how this goes still want to see links from subreddits that enjoy programming in particular on the main reddit page will the recommended system or something like that soon allow this
my prior for news com com producing technically accurate article is very close to and with the evidence from this article my posterior is even closer to still there good argument for the existence of articles like this because lay people have to be introduced to the field somehow and though such articles seem shallow and even inaccurate in many cases people have to start their understanding somewhere it should just be stressed to people that the information gleaned from such articles should be taken with grain of salt also the argument of many people in statistics and machine learning is that baye rule is the correct solution to the problem of induction in my opinion jaynes http bayes wustl edu is the most articulate advocate of that position
ve never used lotus notes but this article on guardian unlimited http technology guardian co uk weekly story html makes me inclined to agree with you emphasis mine gt imagine program used by million people of whom about hate it sound unlikely yet that the perception one garners in trying to discover whether lotus notes ibm groupware application is as readers of technology blog suggested the world worst application the discussions at http tinyurl com and http tinyurl com gdk suggest that those who have used it are united to the average person notes displays all the user friendliness of cornered rat gt fast forward to today and notes has gained widespread takeup users in the uk include british airways toyota volkswagen standard life assurance and most major newspaper groups including guardian media group but further investigation shows that its proponents tend to be administrators and its detractors the end users ouch
ok read his amp but it gave me the impression that he just yet another pop journo making living from feeding people their own prejudices his premise is that groups can sometimes do certain things well it apparently only recently occurred to him and he sells this as new vision he freely interchanges wisdom smartness intelligence effectiveness problem solving and crystal ball gazing as if they were the same thing and then confuses collective decision making with collective he tells us that groups are good at finding solutions to problems that have right answer tell that to einstein and that they are bad at problems of skill such as flying plane or performing surgery strange then that these jobs happen to be best performed by groups just like many other skill based activities such as football and music he then says that the members of the group have to be independently minded or the decision making tends to fail as get out for the many examples where his proposal flies in the face of what actually happens so he not even arguing hive intelligence here using betting odds as an example of the higher efficiency of the crowd over the expert he seems unaware that those odds are set by experts with bookies beating punters every day yes groups have greater pool of knowledge than the individual but this is barely worth stating before read this guy stuff assumed that groups would probably make effective decisions although not ones he now pretty much convinced me that not even this is true

think the fact that someone is arguing the value of crazy frog over google because that what the market says shows the ideological and artificial nature of letting the market decide anything
the documents included legal memos from one jones day attorney to another regarding allegations by activists that diebold had used uncertified voting systems in alameda county elections beginning in so the guy stole attorney work product protected under privilege and he the whistle blower hero ignoring the content of the documents little more concerned that paralegal can steal confidential information relating to legal matter and some people here are ok with that
keep it simple too many subreddits will make it hard to know if an interesting web page belongs in the main reddit or another subreddit agree that this eventually leads to world of tagging instead of making lots of subreddits shouldn the recommended page be able to theoretically capture person interest liked something read on different comment thread about how the act of clicking link would correlate with interest in the subject and clicking the up down arrow suggests the quality of the article not the interest agreement level of the user it seems like most reddit users have lots of interests and don want to try and browse all of their favorite subreddits in order to make sure they are not missing anything good that what is so great about having single main reddit page and why check it every day several times
the canadian health care system is fine most of the people who whine about single payer programs are flacks for the us insurance industry or willingly ignorant there are many alternatives to the corporate rationing we have in the united states each one has it pros and cons to scare americans with lies about the state of canadian heath care is intellectually dishonest it time americans stopped treating health care like privilege

ve added an initial comment explaining the purpose of the crazy link that made point to itself since started doing this often this comment gets lost near the bottom of the comments section though this will cause the submitters to make really long titles whats everyone think
this article had no useful information and didn bear out any true cost other than the writer saying it was more expensive
why not just post link to the actual article
yes the oh so lively ontario version of london
if the titles of links are most of the time misleading so why you read them at all clicking links randomly could yield better results in this case if you on the other hand believe that the titles do improve the rate of interesting articles then why should filter be unable to learn from your clicking data an alternative to learning from clicks could be to regard articles as relevant if rated them regardless whether positive or negative if read an article and rate it probably find its topic interesting misleading title problem solved but then what if donwrate an article because it spam
using mod_gzip with apache is another option that probably results in smaller files

turbogears user and was actually little disappointed with this thought the code for these examples could have been simpler and smaller with the new release of turbogears this presentation doesn really give good impression of features that make this stuff easier in fact it looks very much like what you could just do with the previous release maybe was just expecting more magic from

interesting point but would say the difference is that nowadays people tend to be characterized as straight or gay whereas in ancient greece one was pushed more towards bisexuality which means that men with homosexual tendencies might still have children whereas would guess that if study were done nowadays men would be much more likely to classify themselves as straight and often have children or as gay and not

instead of the url the submitter will add the isbn reddit can link to the amazon page or something with an affiliate link to perhaps get some revenue
yep stupid article think we all realise it is bit harder to live an ethical lifestyle the point being the more we do it the easier it will be in the future if everyone drove that miles to shop then the shop would make money and be able to afford rent in better location duh articles like this are an excuse for living badly

the people in the left lane couldn overtake the people on the right of them cause they wouldve violated the speed limit they weren doing anything illegal

why the reddit founders they have lots of new and exciting features to implement

such great site so true some of those postings there
my sympathy for the suffering people yet fail to see moral or follow up to this story that some people have it better because of un earned privilege is truism in modern capitalist society but it was so in communist states in fascist states and much more so in pre capitalist times also do smell weak pun in writing iniquity when you mean inequ al ity
in other news web companies still trying to figure out how to grow money tree
groups subreddits are for people tags are for topics http reddit com blog subreddit fun html
negative as well ethical lifestyle is not the same as guilt free consumerism they re maybe orthogonal and possibly there actually negative correlation saintly people spend their time in better ways than looking for the right blend of coffee
call it cspapers reddit com then
it doesn matter if of them were totally professional it would be worth doing an expose even if these few cops were the only belligerent dickheads on the force it is downhill from there the other officers who work with them will be taught the worst possible attitudes if those guys are the only cops of their kind it is indicative of systemic problem that they have not already been identified and fired or better trained edit it appears from the video that when said few should have said two still think the point stands friend of mine quit the sfpd because of attitudes like those think of the kind of person who wouldn quit

the fast food argument is groundless garish glossy pizza adverts arrive at your door because pizza is something with which you make no long term commitment the entire goal of the flyer is to lie around the house long enough that someone orders one of the meal deals at that point they rely on the yummyness of the product to move further units how many people buy software this way okay maybe some do but like to think that the majority have their minds made up by the time they hit the retail store and thus apple can afford to make their packages beautiful rather than flashy

have the misfortune of having had to work with lotus notes for years since it was in release now its at way back then it was quite useful pre widespread internet and it had some features that were unique and worked well replication the notes rpc and so on but can honestly say it is the most frustrating stinking pile of unstable dogshit have ever had to work with most notes developers have never used anything else so they dont see what am getting at just to give one example there is no way in the development environment called designer in notes to search for string accross more than one agent havent look at yet there are dozens and dozens of other broken things dont even get me started believe me its the last thing we need on the linux desktop and certainly hope it wont lead microsoft here

sorry ll take an ntsc set any day of the week are you serious more lines is definitely significant especially when your widescreen ntsc movie is using only lines out of cinema is fps it more convenient to speed that up to fps pal than to interpolate or duplicate frames to reach fps ntsc you are raising an interesting issue with the compression ratio there have been single dvd and dual dvd releases of each of the three movies so the author should have mentioned which one he used in his comparison ll take dual dvd pal release any day of the week versus drm encumbered hd edition
extremely distressing news for the linux community to be associated in any way with this steaming pile the reddit post from the guardian http reddit com info id dju not long ago should provide context in case you didn see it note the passion

this info isn right the mini has an gig drive and superdrive dvd burner the cheaper mini having lesser drive cd rw dvd but no dvd burner btw they ve ditched the radeon chipset and gone with integrated intel graphics
you can see the images by clicking on the downsampled ones still not convinced that the comparison is relevant though maybe the dvd captures happen to be or frames interpolated hence lower quality maybe the mpeg codecs are very different some software decoders reduce the accuracy dynamically depending on cpu load
it worked perfectly for me when tested it and apparently other people leave your email address and ll email it to you make my judgements about piracy on case by case basis in this case think feynman would be smiling in the afterlife to see people all over the world reading stories about him being awesome also think the way in which this book changed my life compels me to make sure as many people read it as possible and linking to the amazon reference does not achieve that find your anti piracy spiel bit humorous considering how hard you tried to obtain the pdf

agree if infogami gets on digg and del icio us popular soon then that the end people who read those feeds will check it out will find out that it zero feature wiki will go away and not come back or pay attention when it gets mentioned in those places again and why should they it ll just be infogami now can do what xxx cpanel feature does or whatever who cares certainly no one outside of the demographic of people who read reddit digg del icio us popular which is why it will never get publicity beyond that and why initial publicity there is the kind you can least afford to waste maybe slashdot will hold off until infogami supports viewing site logs and it ll get some bounce from that lt cynic off gt

maybe we should address the assumption that anxiety and depression always need to be treated with drugs often there is reason someone is feeling depressed or anxious that has nothing to do with an abnormal biochemical imbalance and when you circumvent these reasons you are treating the symptom of the problem not the actual problem which find frightening anxiety and depression are not coincidental to our lives and are normal we should pay attention to them not blind ourselves to our own existence
find it odd that in few of the transcripts they accuse the tester as to having mental problems or issues would if they are trained to say that or if they have lot of nut balls that try and file complaints at any rate hope never have to file complaint against cop especially in florida
it mistake to publicly release something this preliminary this is especially true given the high level of anticipation and expectation in the reddit community also get rid of the apologetic quote on top of the site far from enhancing their credibility think it undermines it ideas are cheap implementation is everything you need to be able to show some magic even in early demos
