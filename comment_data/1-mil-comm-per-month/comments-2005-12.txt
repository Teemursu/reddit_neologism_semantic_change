look at vietnam and mexico exposes the myth of market liberalisation
the site states what can use it for meeting notes reports technical specs sign up sheets proposals and much more just like any other new breeed of sites that want us to store everything we have on the web and they even guarantee multiple levels of security and encryption etc but what prevents these web site operators fom accessing and or stealing meeting notes reports technical specs sign up sheets proposals and much more for competitive or personal gains am pretty sure that most of them are honest but what there to prevent me from setting up good useful site and stealing all your data call me paranoid am

on the bright side despite kidnapping and cruelly abandoning him it doesn sound like he was tortured
like lot of people can claim to know first hand about the harsh realities of war that why it matters lot to me that mccain is the one leading the fight against torture in washington he has military background he would not advocate something that would prevent us from defending ourselves and unfortunately for him he knows lot about torture specifically even the white house could not avoid noticing how bad it was for pr to have cheney who avoided service in vietnam advocating torture and mccain war hero speaking out against it so they ve switched to lying we do not torture is now the official line for some definition of torture that they know the hearer doesn share where have heard this before did not have sexual relations with that woman

you can rank the comments and demote the moronicism

interesting article on the use of open space in design
reddit got runner up citation in the peer production news category not bad for site that only been around for few months
this is wonderful just what needed
cool love good font
comments about time want to see what other people think about some articles
as aaronsw points out there big difference between reddit comments and slashdot comments reddit comments are ranked which means not only that the lame stuff gets pushed to the bottom where you can ignore it but that because the order can change users won be tempted into the kind of it is so it is not it is so kind of interchange that makes slashdot comments so tedious and of course there no frist post phenomenon because the graphically first post is the one voted the best not the first chronologically plus you can take real karma hit if you post something dumb that lot of people mod down that should make people think twice put all these together and think comments on reddit will end up being lot better than on slashdot
there nothing like simplicity and not following the crowd for one welcome our new comment spam overlords oh and by the way come up with great simple idea wait for degree of popularity and media attention add unnecessary features profit is this what you want
this would be interesting discussion
still looks like death trap to me
ok so curious why the rating
this story was already posted don you even check before submitting stuff http reddit com info id
wonder how many more years we ll see lists like this badly assembled by human editors instead of by voting it already feels old fashioned at least to reddit user
what it to you it not like you have to look at them on the main page
wonderful and it supports limited amount of markup hope that the discussions will be respectful and edifying it would be nice if the number of comments an entry had were displayed in the list view and if the comment entry box were bit larger or resizeable oh and does comment activity make something hotter personally thought about leaving the site because the interaction that karma offers is pretty cold certainly don like seeing next to my name and feel like the negative ratings on legitimate articles are going to discourage some people how are you guys rating articles tend to promote articles that find interesting leave alone things which are not of interest to me and only demote articles which are old or obviously spam
would like it better if could open and close the list of comments on an article without leaving the main page or atleast the highest rated comments

not sure what the point in the body of this article is the question in the title is somewhat interesting think that if we re talking about web companies none of them are going to become the next microsoft the whole point seems to be releasing simple applications often there isn suite that going to dominate the entire productivity market google with its reach and accumulated loyalty has the best chance of becoming the next microsoft
have you read slashdot lately there are no comments on the front page there either but their tone and idocy seeps through so even the real news stories are presented to th grade reading level and yes am snob like reddit emphasis on technical matters and programming but it not going to last long now guess it the price of popularity wonder how long it ll be before there some social networking options mckirkus has submitted links similar yours would you like to ask this person on date
don listen if you don want to have song stuck in your head all day though maybe tinfoil hat would prevent that

an interesting argument that the church was keeping intellectualism alive during the middle ages is surprising to some people many can only think of the church as hindering science as in the case of intelligent design and the condemnation of galileo also worth reading is jared diamond book guns germs and steel to which the article alludes in the beginning both works probably ignore contradictory evidence for the sake of clarity

of course that makes replies made by users in the nested view look completely out of context
will comments dissapear if ranked low enough can just see the pages with comments now
on few occasions ve voted down highly ranked junk science articles portraying correlation as causation http cr yp to postpropter html ve wanted to explain but of course couldn reddit now has more opportunity to become something like self aware community have also wondered sometimes why articles have high rank and wondered what others were thinking about it the web brings you the world and can think of anything better than people thinking about it writing about it and having dialog it engages the mind shares insights and people like talking
gt of course that makes replies made by users in the nested view look completely out of context think we ll add the ability to show context soon

ummm you re stupid head
first your claim that slashdot presents stories to fourth grade reading level is simply irrelevant as opposed to slashdot all reddit has no front page commentary whatsoever if you don want to see the idocy of all of the unwashed masses far beneath your pedestal just don click on comments second this site is quite clearly not intended as programming tech specific site it quite clearly not intended as an anything specific site if you love its degree of emphasis on programming and so forth it should be quite simple for you to implement similar site with specific emphasis reddit functionality is not complicated and as you are programming and tech snob far above our idocy you should have no trouble duplicating it

think the most intriguing part of mao story started post mortem every day hundreds of chinese line up in beijing to file past his waxy slightly bloated corpse know was one of themâ and itâ hard to preserve corpse and pay their respects despite killing millions of his fellow chinese with his programs he is still regarded by many with great deal of admiration the cult of mao is quite penetrating weighing in with the official party stanceâ on mao deng xiaoping called him seven parts right and three parts wrong kinda makes you wonder what it would take for someone to be ten parts wrong also it should also be noted that mao insisted on subordinates who acquiesced to his every request regularly falsifying production quantities orchestrating false demonstrations of modelâ work communes etc all elaborately manufactured to appease mao over the years he became so ignorant to the realities of chinaâ plight that much of the destruction he caused was not intentional but rather by product of his own insularity not that this excuses it but it may broaden the perspective from which we view it mao was also great lover of chinese opera but unbeknownst to him the production being put on for him was set on the stage of china
ve got to agree with the sentiment here ve been trying to find evidence of this for ages but remember reading years ago that large software company believe it was sun microsystems in the days before they bought star division did some research on office software they found that so called productivity software was the single biggest productivity killer in their organisation instead of developing clear concise messages staff spend hours worrying about fonts and clip art the result of this study was that the company banned the use of office software without express permission everyone had to use plain text mail for all communication does anyone else remember that study anyone have any links love to see it again as it is the missing lynch pin from my anti office software arguement pet topic of mine

yes the title link comment is subjective however what you and the hawks fail to see the war in iraq made us less safe if you dig under the facade the mainstream media presents you will see that the arab world hates us more than they ever did before the war we turned an event for which we could have gotten tremendous support worldwide even in the arab world into the most stupid debacle in the last years

women in the porn industry have had the upper hand in terms of amount paid compared to their male counterparts for some time it follows that the balance of power and the creative control would follow them thought experiment count how many multi millionaire male performers you can name can name one and have never heard mention of one now the female well can remember their names but remember reading about them and seeing referenes to them in various documentaries hbo had one called something like sex in the valley there are lots of them lastly in the days before the internet the porn was controlled by few powerful distributors who were yes male and sometimes affiliated with the mafia the net has removed the power over distribution and created level porn playing field some say this exact thing is occuring right now regarding non porn movies ifilm com is certainly trying it not clear anyone is listening though
gt yes the title link comment is subjective however what you and the hawks fail to see the war in iraq made us less safe if you dig under the facade the mainstream media presents you will see that the arab world hates us more than they ever did before the war we turned an event for which we could have gotten tremendous support worldwide even in the arab world into the most stupid debacle in the last years well not warhawk so that not where coming from this most stupid debacle in the last years that another one of those statements which isn really supported there have been so many ridiculous conflicts within the past years that its pretty difficult to say that this is the worst
name one ware the us was involved in in the last years that was dumber than this war
the image works for me on firefox and mozilla though don have plugin installed to handle the sound
tried it out for couple of hours had to turn if off because it was so annoying to see that little window popup and never saw one comment that was worth reading
you could argue this is the dumbest war the us has ever been involved in though some historians would point to some of the indian wars or the mexican war but this isn even the dumbest thing the us has done in the past years japanese internment during wwii anyone and we did have skirmish in the philippines about hundred years ago that wasn too bright
for conferences heard discussion of collaborative wiki being extremely valuable if large portion of the audience has wifi access they can follow along on wiki and make comments and such sounded neat
name one ware sic that the us was involved in in the last years that was dumber than this war uh think that would be world ware an entire generation of europe young men gassed and machinegunned out of history because one inbred hapsburg was assassinated in the balkans in der balkans who knew ja let go kill off every able bodied male between and in france and britain
if you think the assassination was the only thing that caused wwi you are seriously behind on things
ah interesting guess must ve missed the memo wwi was actually caused by competition to exploit colonial resources germany preemption of france as the major continental industrial power germany attempt to build competitor to the royal navy and the entropic degradation of bismarck spiderwork of treaties when the iron chancellor himself was no longer around to manage them now let ask an analogous question lt gt seriously lt gt what is the us doing in iraq submit that the answer is likely to be more complicated than chimpy mchitlerburton lied to us about weapons of mass distraction michael moore told me so or for that matter we done gawne inter eye rack spread dumawkruhsee an the gospel th heathen if wwi is entitled to lt gt serious lt gt causal examination why isn the iraq war so entitled answer attempting to write history while it still happening is called politics the pompous toad in this article has declared iraq stupid war fine what kind of evidence does he have to back up his reasoning how many soldiers memoirs has he read and deconstructed how many iraqi citizens has he interviewed how many members of the insurgency or is he basing his judgements on reports from the western media who have less information than the coalition military leadership and the iraqi media in the run up to parliamentary election even if you try to be objective under these circumstances you re still going to reach conclusions that support the views you already hold read foulcault and derrida if you don believe me and then if you have any kind of intellectual conscience knock point off this assinine submission so nobody has to see it again
with you there this business of being dumber than in years is the most foolish comparision in the last years
there nothing you can do with objects there nothing you can do with any turing complete language try picking up chicks with the turing complete language of your choice

having spent little not yet enough time evaluating the course ll have to admit that not entirely blown away by it this is probably the wrong forum for going into my reasons for saying that but thought highlight my one major hangup the course is too generic this is not really the designer fault since the course is aimed at all scientists generally however the scientists tend to work with mostly have biology background and contrary to the course designer claims about scientists in general they do not take to the rigour of programming easily just about the only way ve found of keeping their attention is by making the examples focused and relevant to their field of expertise that said might well incorporate some of the elements of this course into my own next year

should be noted that it multi protocol at that nice
the first part of your comment is quite interesting not sure who they are hiring but hiring actual linguists would make sense maybe not from programming standpoint but from an organize the worlds knowledge standpoint with all their powerful computing and brainpower would think they would have better and more prominent translation service still use altavista but would love to see google do some innovation in that field perhaps your comment struck me becuase like languages but think google probably is hiring linguists
what your missing is that comparative advantage can only be realized with free trade free trade is theory in this theory if goods had unfettered access between country and both countries would specialize in what they are good at the with its high standard of living and education is more apt at making technology and culture driven products for people in the to be farming does not make much sense becuase they have access to better education and have more capital people in africa have nothing they could use nature to farm and thats about all they can do so it would make sense for the africans to do the farming and the us to build the websites to sell the farm produce but the africans can not farm because if they grew the produce they could not sell it to anyone because the american stuff is already cheaper of course in the real world things are not that simple not everyone in the is rich or has access to good education and not everyone in africa is destitute but most are painted pretty simple picture with that theory furthermore the situation in africa is worse then this there is no infrastructure because all the governments are so corrupt bill gates could throw all the money in the world at the diseases but nobody over there is really getting innoculated most of the scientists getting special education are leaving africa it really is bad situation one that people should put more effort into being aware of not everything is as peachy as we like to think and after recent talk with some people involved over there myself have been trying to find out more if anyone wants to talk about this stuff they can shoot me an email at my username on reddit at gmail com

agree with you on the three elements that converge into the web phenomena this is why suggest lt webware gt as the term that essentializes what the web is lt web gt because it participative social and global phenomena online lt ware gt because it about software allowing you to do online and with other people the things you would do alone and in your local computer so lt webware gt introduces you to the new internet paradigm the availability of social and personal software online
why are gaming websites always so terribly designed
thats good idea but what happens if the spammers just remove the whatever from all of the email addresses in their database
police will no longer ask driver their whereabouts anymore their onboard car tetra network computer will instruct the officers which government cash generating fine to impose swipe the drivers id card to obtain bank details debt the fine from said drivers bank take digital photo of incident for court of appeal to take points the networked computer knows of an speeding incident where it happened time and the police are just collecting funds for their local beat in fact the police could be waiting at the client address when they get home bill in hand in the future complete listing of mobile phone calls shopping lists petrol costs emails sent utility bills council fines and community charges could be obtained via community police officers pdas on the beat knock on the door and swipe of the bank card please or you will be restricted under asbo from driving your car and we will know and what you did said brought and when all it will need next is terrorism act to impose state control and thought and hello nazi uk
this rationale was spelled out in memo written by john yoo white house attorney less than two weeks after the attacks of it dense read and terrifying piece of legal contortionism but it basically says that the president has unlimited powers to fight terrorism he can spy on anyone arrest anyone and kidnap anyone and ship him to another country merely on the suspicion that he might be terrorist and according to the memo this power lasts until there is no more terrorism in the world
yeah sad but true still hear lot of people following the official sun catalogue of patterns which really blame for this nightmare jee seems to have repaired lot of this but in sense the damage has been done sun should apologise for these patterns and move on
yepp plus the idea ain new at all know many people who have been using this approach for some years now also you don need gmail to sort your emails by address every decent email client on the planet will do that just as good lastly this approach is only useful if you are actually fully determined to sueing those companies arses otherwise it complete waste of time bottom line this article is rather useless
unlike reddit digg and del icio us there is no content to look at on this page
this is great at first thought it would be stupid obvious or trivial but clearly there aresome insights here that are interesting
sadly or thank god this is nothing specific to america in germany every couple of months you can spot headline somewhere saying something along the lines of of germans don know the name of their current president but know the name arnold schwarzenegger that basic flaw of any democracy most people are just uneducated or ignorant or don have time to learn or can be bothered knowing or remembering everything however they are not retarded or mentally disabled or even stupid and that why iq tests simply won work if you set the bar at an iq of or even most people will actually pass the test even those who don know the name of the current president and if you set the bar at then you end up with few hundred people voting on the future of millions which by itself ain bad you just can call that democracy anymore
classes that expose data instead of hiding it oh no seriously that isn problem at all some data is just data and the most useful way to deal with it is to treat it as data not intimately familiar with the interface you re talking about so can say whether this is right under the circumstances also object orientation is not universal problem solver when procedural code and raw data appear in object oriented systems figure out first whether it is the right solution if it is complain that the language does not support it better not that it does not fit the artificial mold of object orientation quit pretending that oo is everything oo is great for some things and not for others
every time think about computer languages have to think about people because that who the languages are really written for what if there global human blurb paradox is it possible for facts and ideas to exist beyond some computational horizion of our current biological hardware literally do unphantomable ideas exist and how can you express those ideas within formal system
my only problem with this approach is that time in which big bowl of spaghetti code gets created gets compress into few years it takes time to get something right why isn he taking this approach to writing arc
writing software fast doesn necessarily yield spaghetti code in fact the opposite seems more likely that the only way to get code written fast is to be constantly rewriting it to keep it as clean as possible that what did at least

measurement leverage and property rights letting him keep it is way of saying that property rights are respected only mention this because it makes it easier to understand why some industries act the way they do am lawyer for instance lawyers cannot patent or copyright their work which leads to two pathologies either the work is made public and everyone gets to use it without paying the creator or the work is confidential and many customers who would be willing to pay for it don get to because of the lawyer who knows the secret only has so much time in his day that why the best lawyers charge hr and any lawyer can get away charging with hr does anyone really think that the best of the best are only four times better than the guys who had to take the bar exam three times to pass it that doesn make much sense to me also know that if work as hard as computer programmer in start up ll get lot of billabe hours but my work will be filed with the sec where all the world can see amp copy it not much motivation for innovation is it

great article on why foreign savings continue to fuel domestic investment and the need to raise private business and personal savings rates from their all time lows
dupe reddit why oh why can you detect dupes somehow
had to post this in response to gmail spam feature that is currently hot on reddit this service is so much better the pcmag review is quite twisted but the comments on the site speak for themselves
wealth distribution is different issue from wealth creation the nerds will probably find they benefit by giving away some lunch money to the bullies not only in the form of free sofware which might not be able to use but also in the form of the medium of exchange their cash stable society lets the nerds work without the interruptions that upset them so much
you have to address that kind of argument to governments because now it national governments rather than local warlords that are in position to steal the nerds lunch money or decide to refrain
ewwwww

american here in uk circa and on the last trip there the proliferation of cctv cameras on streets and buildings in london and outlying areas was very noticeable any thoughts on how past socialism movements in the uk weakened the uk to the point where abuse of this scale is now acceptable that could be what previous commentor meant when he referred to hello nazi uk
so glad that they ve clarified this no preferential results and no graphical ads on google com excellent
it wasn posted here because we are all familiar with paul graham site and have probably found it ourselves already always ready to answer rhetorical question at your service
very very beautifully explained thought dna will always be mystery thing for me unless decided to study about it full time
part of the fun is lt gt not lt gt having instructions
entirely fair if the site is solely intended to be feed of the web thought though that reddit is also about rating well known bits of the web eg norvig programming in years essay and all of the other stuff of graham etc
it seems that arguments isomorphic to this come up all over the place google focus on customer benefit joel spolsky on having managers move the furniture so that coders can be maximally productive your hypothetical smart government on letting the very best hackers keep larger percentage of the profit from their all of these could be reduced to more general statement about the way to succeed today figure out who the important people are and do stuff they want perhaps
can assure you that the worst lawyers do not get hour friend of mine worked with few that made rather less than that per working day pre tax and on the other side trial lawyers who get paid out of settlements must surely do better than hr if they get big win that said what sort of thing would you want to get property rights on anyway contract language fundamentally that is the only thing that lawyers create that scales like software
sorry it sounded like bragging my point was that it has been available on that site from long time and paul apparently didn know that

victor davis hanson does an interesting job chewing out modern day academia for losing its edge on free ie the classical definition of liberal thinking luckily many computer science departments are immune from this type of thing
one nitpick we would have much preferred chance of million to chance of million even though theoretically the second is worth twice as much this reasoning holds for lottery say where all you have to do is scratch the numbers but in terms of something where you sink countless hours and mental energy there is certainly an opportunity cost as well in other words what else could you have done during that time and how much money would you have made to really calculate the relative values of the two options you have to factor in opportunity costs of course paul point stands and the article is as well written and to me at least motivational as well now if only had clever idea
reddit is what new online not rate the web so for my part will demote anything old like this article
interesting read wonder how well this whole do what users want not what you are good at interested in strategy applies to startups that develop high tech products sw development tools etc rather than use high tech products to develop for consumers web stores etc seriously doubt one can succeed in that area without any interest in and appreciation for technology one is working on
wouldn advocate doing stuff you re not at all interested in if there are several things you could do that users want do the one you ll like most just don lie to yourself about whether users want it for example the main reason viaweb ended up being server based was that we didn want to have to write windows apps but it was also win for users we weren just doing it to suit our own tastes

don think you were at all interested in web stores as domain would you work on one if there were no money involved you could keep yourself interested and motivated because you got to hack it using lisp tool in other words you were using your favorite tool while working on something that you weren truly interested in if you are working on product which itself is tool from domain that you are interested in things change the nasty part comes in the fact that the better the tool one can create the less likely it will be what majority of users want seems the only way out is to create the tool and to exploit it yourself

great essay it concisely sums up how the economic world works in way anyone could understand except for one side argument it seems to me the article claims that for an economy to be successful it must let their wealth generators keep what they make that without this component the talented will have no incentive to create that may be the reason capitalism has been so successful but are we sure our economy isn just local maximum is there really no other reason to create wealth you argue that without this incentive everyone output will be reduced to the mean as it is in big bureaucratic business but you also state that no one really like working this slow and that an engineer would work their ass off on sexy projects like fighter jets open source is another example that shows there has to be more incentives to person than just building wealth maybe big business can get as much out of their troops because the only incentive they can give is money what if they no longer needed to provide this what if they were forced to find something else to give their employees would they be able to motivate people better than they do now google has many top producers that no longer need personal wealth and yet they still seem to be innovating maybe capitalism works so well because it easy letting people keep what they create takes relatively little infrastructure but as the economy grows it seems to be getting harder we need more laws more financial institutions more cruft more wasted wealth building the infrastructure of central economy without corruption is hard risky problem but maybe at some point it will be cheaper than what we have now

yes think can be taught just like anything else we teach it at combinator the problem is just that most of the people teaching it at universities don have any first hand experience of it how well university can teach subject depends on whether the teachers are the leading practitioners of it so colleges are good at teaching physics and medicine beause the best physicists and doctors are professors they re somewhat less good at teaching programming because the best hackers don necessarily become professors and they re terrible at teaching literature or because good writers and startup founders actively avoid becoming professors
interesting to see how this site is going to develop
people are certainly motivated by more than money don need more and keep working the motivations know of are pleasure in the work fame benevolence and money think lot of the most tedious stuff will only be done for money for example keeping web server up and running that not going to make you famous it not fun and if you were motivated purely by benevolence you probably prefer to go to africa where you could literally save lives nearly all the economic infrastructure is like keeping web server up and running you could make case that improving the overall level of technology might save more lives in the long run but don think benevolence is the main reason people work on it
interesting site its sort of the wikipedia of factoids

what is it about academia that makes the writers and founders want to stay away the benefit to universities of having either around is so great that would think any obstacle would get smoothed out by trustees looking for the next google yahoo whatever and many parts of the academic life seem to be close fit with hacker lifestyle
the author conclusion that we ll be unable to influence the progression of internet communities through technology alone is contradicted by the contrast between various social sites for example the different posting mechanisms on slashdot reddit and joel spolsky forums encourage different behavior one could even try to prove that the functionality of the sites determines their respective audiences though don have any data on this subject if people use the internet to reinforce their pre existing views then it is only because people don actively seek to debunk what they believe the technology forces nothing upon them
while it may seem self evident that you create wealth by providing something people want many business people forget this fact some years ago turned to the dark side and got an mba from harvard business school in my classes learned lot about creating and capturing value essentially we re told that value equals the difference between willingness to pay and production cost the problem is that this equation reduces wealth to simple arithmetic and encourages you to treat product creation as simple case of lowering costs or increasing prices started several businesses that focused on slicing and dicing cashflows and incentives while they had some success at making money wasn really creating wealth was just coming up with other ways to slice up the pie ve seen the light since then but lot of other suits have not glad paul made this essay available to the general public maybe it will help other people come to the same realization
this doesn work
there is an interesting phenomenon occurring at reddit whereby the majority left leaning denizens of the sight are slowly alienating the minority right leaning ones like myself the only question have is why do care not sure why care if story about some idiotic italian magistrates gets voted up to the top of the hot list but do starting to feel like don fit in here maybe you should change the name to blueit
delicous sounding crab cakes
don agree with the last comment the academic life is quite structured and formulaic publish or perish tenure politics grant writing could go on it has been falsely romanticised by hollywood on more than one occasion think you can sow the seeds of startup while at university because that is where many great revolutionary ideas originate as result of the interactions between faculty and students but you cannot run company because your as professor are all consuming
several of those are perhaps they didn want search engines to index dead pages
the number of promotions this article is getting shows how much people love anything controversial even if the controversy is unfounded
gt if people use the internet to reinforce their pre existing views then it is only because people don actively seek to debunk what they believe the technology forces nothing upon them your proved his point exactly people don like to seek out stuff that will change their views so they go to online communities that fit their view and they only become further entrenched in it where as in real life you are often forced into situations where you must deal with people of different views and behaviors with the internet and technology you can go to these little islands of behavior and never see people who disagree with your mindset again thus it is technology which leads people to be like that

vonnegut writes they have had to throw away their educations even harvard or yale educations to become guessers if they didn do that there is no way their uninhibited guessing could go on and on and on an alternative perhaps harvard and yale aren discouraging guessing as much as we like to think why assume that all of these powerful well educated americans have thrown away what they ve learned maybe they re actually applying it
such poll is as much about spreading pubic opinion as it is about measuring it to run poll like this means the editorial staff of the publication is lending support to and legitimizing the impeachment effort whether or not you think bush should be impeached it understandable for traditional media source to be cautious in matters such as this

not to troll hope isn the rule of law something that the right cares about kidnapping is against the law no matter who does it right wouldn it be more appropriate to ask our allies the italians to arrest suspected terrorists in accordance with italian law instead of dragging them off to egypt is terrorism really such dire threat that the ending it justifies any means
definitely agree however reddit isn quite as bad as certain other sites we do see some good articles about economics sometimes and recently john mccarthy sustainability site was on the front page although that might be just lisp effect heh call me crazy but actually think there something about lisp that makes people libertarian and therefore right wing relative to the mainstream
industries should be allowed to do whatever they want to do bribe wreck the environment just little fix prices screw dumb customers put stop to competition and raid the treasury in case they go broke that free enterprise the poor have done something very wrong or they wouldn be poor so their children should pay the consequences the united states of america cannot be expected to look after its people the free market will do that the free market is an automatic system of justice is it bad sign that agree with all that except for the raid the treasury part

like the essay but would go further the ethic of measurement and leverage can be applied to other sorts of firms than tech startups the example of semco http observer guardian co uk business story html is incredible they were once struggling manufacturer of machinery and then in paul terms they gave everybody enormous leverage to the point of picking their own bosses and influencing their own salaries but they also published everyone contribution to profits from the firm all the way down to the individual not only did they get self motivated workers and amazing results but middle management withered away to nothing the smartest techies have intrinsic leverage since the company assets are located inside their heads so the primary problem at non tech firm like semco is inculcating the right democratic and entrepreneurial values
additionally if the citizenry did achieve this informed status and since politicians still do like to get elected and re elected they would have to vote in way to please this informed citizenry unless everytime the public elected politician this politician went ahead and ignored the will of this citizenry you would end up with plenty of incumbents only at this theoretical point where citizens suddenly become informed might there be mass replacement of congresspeople but the dynamic changes would stabilize as servants of the informed began to hold political offices use the congressional elections as an example where christian conservative constituents became more informed that their representatives were not serving their interests which some people may not share and power shifted right and there generally has not been huge shift since there is also the problem that people are selectively informed about different issues and values these issues differently this site reflects people informed enough to know what lisp is something most other people couldn care about if it was brought to their attention
how is bringing attention to this article alienating the minority right leaning denizens it seems noteworthy that number of warrants have been issued for cia agents in europe issuing warrants also makes their identies known and probably makes it so they can no longer freely operate as agents outside of the usa that big deal to people on the left and right modding this article up doesn mean you endorse such an action the only position you can safely derive is that people find it interesting noteworthy

sites such as reddit digg and slashdot do reflect certain tastes and that is consciously or not why people visit them compare that to your selection of daily newspaper and there are valid comparisons everybody knows to some extent what kind of editorial to expect from certain sources traditional media or otherwise think the interesting point of discussion is whether technology is exacerbating an existing social trend and with user content enrichmentâ being such an emphasised area of web development right now would think the feedback loop is strengthened even places like memeorandum that are completely automated still exhibit echo chamber characteristics some post recently mentioned that it even spawns the creation of new content off the back of hot topics to jockey into the limelight and onto memeo as far prophesies of doom go think people know what to expect from where and probably have more highly developed sense of taste that can tell instinctively where the lines of these loopsâ lie
libertarianism is not political position it is more an expression of arrested development children and teenagers always think that their feelings and what they want to do are the most important things in the world self sacrifice and notion of being part of greater society that come with growing up bit are incompatible with the basic thrusts of libertarianism as see it most people who call themselves libertarians seem to be unwittingly using it as figleaf for being fantastically shallow and selfish the closest political position to libertarianism is probably the anarchist one

think different things keep writers and founders away writers are kept away because they could not stand talking about literature in the way english professors do it founders are kept away because they don need the money and because if they were going to teach about startups the way to do it would be out in the field as angel investors not in some room full of people who ll never actually start companies

actually as lifelong atheist think it might be good idea to have an official state church in the usa single officially recognized state funded church denomination that was considered the default religion for anybody who didn choose to opt out of it and pick another would have to cater to everyone could not afford to discriminate or act too fundamentalist crazy it would have to be church for the whole people and therefore couldn make enemies of anybody really and because it be the largest religion by far it with its necessary tolerance would become the standard for other denominations to be judged by an association with the state would tame religion think or since this the usa we re talking about maybe it would destroy the state politics here have way of being bass ackwards lot of the time
what about consumerism as the new religion can see it now buying is the new tithe

the worst form of procrastination face is thinking without acting reading things on reddit reading programming language manuals and walking around my apartment with cup of coffee or beer after reading this essay don think the way to combat this type of procrastination is to stop thinking but rather to put limit on how long you let yourself think without acting you should know how to implement quickly in your field for programming that means actually writing code for writing that means getting words down on page in science it must be conducting an experiment no matter how shoddy programmers and artists are blessed because they have easy ways to sketch all fields have ways to sketch though someone looking to fix the healthcare system could create simulation or see how there plans would impact five different people that they know we all want to do great things and we should
you know like paul grahams stuff not one of these people who dislike him because he successful or because he popular interestingly he wrote an essay on being popular but it was talking about quite the opposite now he popular does that cause problems anyway ve decided to register with reddit and post something but only because avoiding doing this particular piece of work as ve said like pauls work but just get the feeling that its waning his earlier stuff was was real wow factor for me as it was exactly what been thinking and mirrored what we were doing what read now is ok but don send it to all my friends and print it to make my wife read it am the only one who feels like this
im stunned to think that people dont understand how unjust the death penalty is and how there is no risk too small to conviction that an innocent person may die
really would like to disagree with what you said but think its true starting one own business is the last thing on most people minds at my college atleast am from india it seems like the objective of four years of be is job via campus recruitment at some well known company or as step towards an mba from one of the iims or higher studies abroad no one really thought of starting company right after college when tell my friends that if can will start company right after college even though too have been campus placed at reputed firm most of the reactions are like but you will work for big co for sometime you know to gain experience won you or simply yeah right
worry about something like this happening but judging by traffic an imperfect measure know it doesn seem to be yet the most popular essays ongoing are how to start startup march great hackers july and what you ll wish you known january very recently ve been writing lot about the same topic startups because writing book about that so there has been less variety than usual in the past six months but ve now written most of what need to about this topic
actually totally agree with him after typing this even felt chills well one of those guys still fighting to create something interesting and know how hard it is to let go of errands all can say is that had no idea of what kind of work would need have no idea of what kind of work will still need but will keep going no matter what thankfully halfway through the feeling of having accomplished something interesting is great one but the everest is way higher when you are right there

thanks for the reply paul noticed that change from what we did and did right to what we re doing don even blog so maybe little unfair to post what did however it was an observation from my own that used to enthuse about your essays this particular one was interesting though but unlike the earlier ones think what was missing was the how to element take care
quines that are based on reading the file are classed as cheating
there another kind of time wasting errand the recurring errand what makes it special is that you can really be more productive by doing it sooner or more often take mowing the lawn you can mow five times harder and then not need to mow it for longer period the same goes with cleaning something else ve found that not watching tv has been huge time gain we chose not to have cable in our house if accidentally play computer game for hours instead of one it no big deal when we do watch tv we watch dvds of series that have been pre filtered by our friends
discussed paul graham work with friend recently he said that he worried that paul graham is so popular now that even if he wrote crap that some people would like it just because it was him that wrote it this is very real concern as ve seen it happen to others think it good that paul graham always has friends review his writing because they probably give more accurate measure of quality in his work than the overall group of readers personally found this latest article very interesting since suffer from the problem of procrastinating work on hard problems also thought ideas for startups which heard in person at startup school was great essay trying to use ideas from both of those essays to help me get started on something interesting

this essay is right on the mark can even count the number of times day feel pangs of guilt for not doing what should be doing and working hours week in fledgling two man startup those three types of procrastination are not the only ones find however like bugs in programming there can be compound procrastination too sometime find myself procrastinating from working on hard problem by reading reddit or slashdot but in reality the reason reading is so that don feel guilty about not doing chores and can have more time to do real work perhaps my extremes are special case however in my freshman year of high school when particularly stern teacher stated flatly that no essay would be accepted late unless someone was suffering from serious illness was bold enough to raise my hand and patiently wait to ask the question is procrastination serious illness still not sure if was really kidding

find that the least productivity damaging way to deal with errands is to put all of them off until some one errand can no longer wait and then do them all at once in other words apply greedy algorithm to the fewest interruptions problem sometimes if most of the errands are sufficiently mindless they become type productive block of time in themselves because while doing them can still mull over hard problems in the back of my mind
my experience is probably atypical but think startups came out of the class was in one dotcom and biometrics integrator it would be interesting to have an class that was graded solely on the basis of final project and which had required application for admission other than the fact that the students would still have other classes to do and that they would be drawn from single university it sounds similar to sfp modulo diff comb teacher this would seem to be step along the vector from normal angel investors to combinator you lower the cost of entry for the would be entrepreneurs and give up some control as you lower barriers to entry into anything you will tend to get worse average but better leadergroup actually that is not quite true when you lower lt gt uniform lt gt barriers to entry that is the case when nonuniform barriers to entry are lowered the average might go up too the university need not give the kids enough to live on they already have dorms etc further the universities need not get any of the company to make it worth their effort they could take of the company and give it to the instructors or something as part of the terms of the class and thus guarantee that this class had the pick of the instructors but they have no additional cost and hence no need to profit if the class was given over the summer semester then it would get really cheap for the colleges they have excess housing for the summer anyway so other than their cluelessness why don the very best colleges do their own in house combs bet olin shivers would do such class as would robert dewar at nyu and greenspun at mit

you hit the spot sketching is such good concept was in rut at work with something spent lot of time reading reddit and slashdot and paul graham was thinking about the problem the whole time but never actually doing something when finally just went to work everything kept falling into place the way thought would do it got replaced by something better over and over now after relatively short amount of time have something that works and it feels so good liked this essay and your comment because they put to words what went go through
amazed that people can still believe that killing people in order to prove that killing people is wrong is right to me it not even about justice or the risk for mistakes it about what should or should not be acceptable for the rest of us the good guys the part of society who don go committing serious crimes to do simply do not agree that killing is or should be acceptable other than in self defense no matter what the intended victim may have done even if they deserve to die that shouldn be enough to give us the right to kill if it does then who to say that what qualifies as deserving to die won start changing shape over time

ruby is remarkably slow language this isn really big problem because the rdbms will do most of the heavy lifting but you should be aware that making really responsive applications with rails is pretty much impossible just look at the speed of basecamp and backpackit it tad on the sluggish side rails is lot of fun to work with it consistent and pretty well documented but all the dynamic code really slows it down ve used rails for commercial purposes and will continue to do so because like working with rails so much
actually the case against doing at least some classes of errands is even stronger than in the essay you can pay or convince other people to do most errands for you have only ever operated washing machine dryer about times in the years that have lived away from home further if you are willing to put up with some social opprobrium you can cut giant swaths of errands out of your life

experiment form of recursive procrastination that is start hacking on something like instead to do paywork then get it done and know it working enough that with the remaining lot of actually work to get the last complete it nice stuff but it too late after already enjoyed it and it time to switch to something else and so on fortunatelly in this process something even if at stage is good enough to be used in the real world so from time to time actually able to produce still maybe lot of better stuff we all produce are in this but not ready box saw this pattern in number of other hackers
after reading some of the replies in this post get the feeling that some people are taking this article as an excuse to stop doing important things and instead focus on misguided things yeah skipping doing some random things here and there while you work on what you hope will be successful startup one day is great but what happens if that startup is colossal failure isn that putting all your eggs in one basket
lt gt just look at the speed of basecamp and backpackit it tad on the sluggish side lt gt since you mentioned it gave basecamp try it feels as fast as google which is pretty responsive to me can you give me an example of really responsive application
was surprised to discover whole new world of respect for courtney until that atrocious neal stephenson quote at the end the article has dated very well imo something that bothers me is that when everyone is complaining about the record label cut of cd nobody ever mentions the shop and distribution markups which are greater
don think work has to be bone crushingly insightful to be valuable it helps to have it written out so you can keep reading what you already know
heh think the people saying that paul graham is popular and famous might wanna compare him to the celebritys constantly blasted at us on the tv for while and ponder he entertain me and the reddit crowd seem to like him but nobody else has ever heard of him for heavens sake procrastination yeah well tried not mowing the lawn turns out the neighbours would rather complain while pushing thier own mower over it than they would knock on my door and ask me to mow it myself not that own mower or anything stupid bit of grass wanna pave it over with giant chessboard really but can afford it
yeah to reiterate that point had never heard of paul graham until started getting into reddit
it an ok piece but not new and it relies on central improbable assertion that for many most people macros are going to be really really hard in world filled with solutions like template metaprogramming and the java ejb mess think macros look relatively clean
is writing an essay on procastination really the hardest problem in paul graham field
surprisingly inspiring stuff feel much better over the fear of wasting time on the big things now think that holds me back but now think about it it never is wasted and it rarely fails at worst the problem will morph into something solvable or else perhaps it wasn meant to be solved anyway
on top of that you have given youself quality time to break the back of the hard problem so the errands aren so annoying now in fact they can be nice sort of break especially if it is manual such purchasing something visiting etc
not at all in my case the big scary important things are really what am paid to do and luckily want to do blow up the importance of the errands so feel like can get quick fix of producivity buzz
yeah didn think the essay addressed the perspiration versus inspiration part you do need to do the last often times guess the trick is to keep the momentum from the first
don know what to make of ocaml claims about having near performance some say it only for code that looks like code still interesting it french centered the way ruby is japanese centered apparently edit four months later much more interested in ocaml and think it might make good substitute for in many cases in that case if the code looks like sometimes or lots of times at least you can forget about memory management while still getting performance close to or better than
so how would you construct religion that covered averaged over from the basic ideas in abrahamic faiths to buddhisim to wicca to etc etc etc etc etc while you may have an interesting idea just fail to see any way of even hypothetically making it work unless completely misunderstood what you meant
it probably significantly less hard than finishing arc

use backpack lot it is great but it is not google speed at all but because of great design and clever use of ajax tricks it is more then usable am worried that the good work that rails does in the development side may not extend to complex nasty real world deployments mostly due to the fact that the rails crowd seems to want to do their own thing and not use other platforms tricks that people learned long time ago may be old an cynical but there seems an arrogance of youth around rails at the moment an attitude that they know best and most past technologies were done by idiots time will show this as incorrect at least partially

michael my gut feelings kinda agrees with you but don actually know that much about these issues do you have specific suggestions about deployment platforms tricks for more complicated environments
no not really part of the reason things like ee got into such mess was concept of partitions roles developers being just one part of the food chain in reality lot of the world is domainated by sysadmins and ee and its ilk was lot about giving deployment options back to them java itself does this by making the binaries cross platform so the platform can change at the sysadmins whim in some ways rails is back to the future in this regard think peter yared active grid is talking up the fact that linux is everywhere and therefor linux is the platform so maybe it is ultimately non issue but not in my world yet as for rails think there are few tools out there guess the trick is to automate it automate automate and then automate again ideally you will just run one command to deploy one to undo that deployment if it all goes wrong but it will take time to mature believe
how is he wrong that kinda doesn really say anything at all the author makes several points in his article

reduce which can be replaced with for loops and lambda which can be replaced by named functions well you could replace most things with less advanced features if you don mind pointless hard work in fact we could program using turing machines who needs sql when you could happily rearrange bits and get the same result this opinion about reduce shows one thing this guy is wrong about he not wrong about other stuff though
for me and number of people know paul graham is the reason have heard of reddit not the other way round think heard of him through slashdot couple of years back and have regularly checked his site for updates ever since imagine that reddit success in quickly creating wide reaching community is largely due to the links paul has put on his site
this is great article on self imposed constrains in web design
oh yeah ve been reading his essays since started trying to learn lisp while back he is nevertheless not famous oh yes
what the point in drinking alchohol if one wants to stay sober anyway it can hardly be the good taste of it or am missing something also he talks about eating potatoes and raw eggs and stuff but what really in them that prevents you from getting drunk the medical explaination
it boils down to two problems first is discipline you need it to switch from to procrastination second is wisdom you need it to distuingish between and jobs

the author hypothesis is that python is not growing towards lisp and that it shouldn the former is undoubtedly true the latter will always be up for debate no one can agree on the terms of the debate though so it will likely remain an unproductive argument prescod makes several unsubstantiated claims in particular that an object is better abstraction than function and that programmers do not like deeply nested expressions the former statement strikes me as meaningless some will program just as well with functions as others will with objects the latter observation hints at the strange element of lisp syntax that differentiates it from other programming languages deeply nested expressions gt most other languages don have as many parentheses most other languages do not use prefix syntax glancing over sheet of lisp code and sheet of python code what will strike you most is the difference in indentation the python code will have several more sections of statements at the same indentation level prescod claims that most programmers prefer this type of indentation of course he has no data to back up this claim suspect that most programmers do like python indentation more than they like lisp indentation the comparison is unfair however since most hackers start programming in language other than lisp

my respect for courtney love just went up several notches
it wouldn have to cover every possible idea just cater to every actual person who didn care enough to specifically opt out of it my background here is from growing up in country with pretty much that kind of state religion plus percent of the population were members of the church and almost everybody ignored it the church offended nobody and happily took in the vast majority of those people who actually wanted to be religious they defaulted into the state church which was mostly harmless since it didn want to and politically couldn afford to offend anybody the only people who opted out of the church were people who wanted to join nutball fringe sect of some kind or other and vanishingly small fraction of atheists even stauncher than there was no need to for anybody else in other words opting out of the state church could be used as handy signal of unreasonable fanaticism or some other kind of intellectual weirdness

oddly enough yes it one of them deliberately decided to focus on writing essays in it seems to me fairly hard problem to try to get to the bottom of questions lot of people have wondered about
don think switching from to procrastination is mainly question of discipline think it depends more on figuring out what sort of work you like and arranging your life possibly with some sacrifices so you get to spend more time doing it

you know whats procrastination sitting in front of your machine all day long doing nothing but reading all the hot articles on reddit
voting this down just because find it unacceptable to start reading opinion in the title of the link
does not work if you have websense
such low ratings does the reddit crowd not care to learn new things
sorry should either have been more clear or more probably omitted that entirely think that micro benchmarks like the accumulator generator are actually somewhat useful in that they show how naturally language does that one thing look at the python entry and see that it does not do closures well for whatever that is worth to me less trivial thing is that he equates novices with dufuses there is very big difference between the two and designing for the two groups is very different
solving np is important but only if we can do something useful with that solution what would we be able to do if we knew np break encryption algorithms schedule resources more effectively wouldn wait around for people to agree on what the most important problems are pick problem think of some solutions and get cracking my guess is that the solution to np will fall out of working on specific hard problem attack it from an angle
paul covers lot of ground in this essay good deal of economics and development theory and history great many minds have spent lot of time on these topics and think overall they haven found the answers to be as simple as paul makes them out to be am not one of these scholars so won make the definitive critique but can think of few points families need stability as well as economic growth paul formula provides no way to even try to find the right balance tremendous amount of wealth is created by government funded research think of all the medical research and the military funding of arpa and missile programs and transistors paul analysis has no good way to account for that there is tremendous amount of wealth being create by the free open source movement that cannot be accounted for by paul analysis the foss seems to be populated by socialist utopians from bygone era richard stallman is leftist of some kind and linus torvalds is from finland lt gt relatively lt gt socialistic country it is not really possible to prove why the industrial revolution happened where it did you can make reasoned arguments but that not the same thing we need to explain why ancient greek was able to create so much mathematics without any entrepreneurs in the age of nuclear weapons and genetic engineering we still need to be able to rein in some kinds of research no entrepreneur will do that unless one invents something change introduces instability and the danger of this is neither predictable nor controllable there is undeniable risk it isn that so much of what paul said was wrong is that there is so much else that needs to be explained and that none of it can be proven it must also be said that if it were not for the entrepreneurs not only would not have career but would probably not be alive not denying the positive side saying the analysis paul gives is just not enough it version not version

gt very interesting might be wrong however but it seems that many of his assertions about judeo christian seem to be only the ideas of christianity not judaism at all as far as can tell he only makes two assertions about judeo christian ideas and both stem from judaism and thus had foundation in christianity gt cain kills abel and we inherit the mark of cainâ and the myth of cain the belief that we are all somehow murderers at bottom this shows of the core concepts behind that story first of all the only person to inherit the mark of cain was cain himself and second of all the biblical story isn that we are all murderers at the bottom but rather sinners whether that sin be greed lust idolatry murder etc gt until the twentieth century judeo christianity tended to focus on the first one the serpent apple popularly if not theologically equated with the discovery of sexuality but as sexual taboos have lost their old forbidding force the mark of cainâ has become relatively more important in the judeo christian idea of original sinâ the same churches and synagogues that blessed just warsâ in former centuries have become strongholds of ideological pacifism think the only reason this is the case is not because theologically anything has changed but rather politically the catholic church isn as powerful any longer and waging wars isn in its best interest for the record am not catholic and its interesting that the author says what he does because until the th century the fruit it wasn the serpent nor was it an apple didn really have to do with sexuality but rather with loss of innocence the man and woman now were wise and instead of simply wanting to obey god they started worrying about the fact that they were naked etc the whole sexuality bit about the fruit has been romantization of it over the past century the article itself seems pretty valid it probably would ve helped his case to keep inaccurate statements about christianity out of it though

am successful entrepreneur and was exactly the kind of procrastinator paul graham talks about have an extremely sharp sense of what important in order to succeed at my goal and tend to only do that however this has caused me lot of problems postponed washing my chlotes and buying new ones until was almost in rags procrastinated on doing accounting so had to dissolve my first company because the accounting was disaster and had to start new one just for this reason don know if this is usual in your country but in mine it is procrastinated on cleaning my house used to be rat paradise the end result is the fact that my lifestyle sucked had lots of stress was always afraid something bad will happen because of my sharp focus on what important then decided to change my current approach is that even if have something important to do such as interviewing and hiring new developer some things such as accounting taking shower etc always have priority get these done as quickly and as efficiently as possible and then move on to what really important since took this decision my life is lot better wear clean chlotes and don live in fear that an accounting audit will come and fine me lot paul graham has point in his article however if applied verbatim his advice will lead to lot of stress and bad life
and then after you put off an errand until it can no longer wait on the last day something happens and you can do the errand so you don complete the errand on time which can have various consequences if know there will be penalties for example didn fill the paperwork in time so ll get fined and maybe also treated badly tend to procrastinate even more making the matter worse so lump them together but don wait until the last day

there are good cases to make for putting the tools to create syntactic abstractions into the hands of programmers however this guy fails and he fails miserably what enables him to pull his example off is call cc not macros you can implement generators just as gracefully in macroless language with call cc such as ruby in fact when first wrote generators implementation in scheme it didn even occur to me to use macros macros are great but they should almost never be considered until procedural abstraction has been determined inadequate
this has been good month in terms of justifying myself to my wife first nice article from atlantic on introversion now this essay on procrastination keep em coming guys we introverted procrastinators need some ammunition on our side for change

famous is rather hard thing to define as it relative to each person interests suspect almost everyone who interested in both lisp and startups knows who paul graham is while the average person does not by way of comparison know very little about pop and movie stars there was an amusing link on reddit recently about lindsay lohan and while ve heard the name before have no idea what she famous for guessing it singing or acting

very well written essay after reading some of the comments though am concerned that maybe didn take it as seriously as some of the others who have commented or maybe there was some inside angle that reading in vacuum doesn render this to me is one of the many reasons the article is well written multiple meanings to multiple people living in rome italy kind of out of the loop on some most of america popular fixes icons of the moment hence don know anything about paul graham but none of this takes away from the very plain very obvious fact that good and bad procrastination is extremely well written and if pg has the insight to choose his friends to proofread his essays as do for mine because they all happen to be smarter than am then all the better hats off to you mr graham kristina three layer cake

when working on hard problem and figure something out stop should just write the code but reward myself by taking break or having lunch or running an errand content that know how to solve the problem when it comes time to implement the solution it no longer an interesting problem so it becomes chore which is exactly what need when hit the next brick wall and so it proceeds the path between me and my goals is roller coaster and to do list is not good leveling algorithm

like to make points about paul essay just because someone is able to focus on some great project don see that in itself as having merit it depends on what the outcome of the project is adolf hitler was deloused at the expense of the state in and was effectively destitute at that time however he rose to great power following wwi there wasn lot of procrastination as he strove towards his big project goal in short there moral aspect to what we work on are you working on the most important problems in your field having spent many years in scientific research myself have to ask the question who decides what the important problems are thomas gold was right on the money for some problems that weren even on the radar screens of his peers of course he also had some spectacular misses but my point is that few institutions tolerate men like thomas gold many artists and include mathematicians scientists and business people here too successful or otherwise are so self absorbed with themselves find them both boring and fairly shitty people to work with or just to be around them personally see some merit in say someone who puts the needs of his or her children first in effect making them project nor do see it as inevitable that if you do so that you cannot also be successful in other areas of your life that said very much enjoyed paul essay as it put some of the main issues of procrastination into stark contast andrew sheppard

oh yeah he ruthlessly took advantage of poor defenceless get rich quick scheme

in your example the users of your counter procedure now need to know that in order to make counter they need to call make generator that an ugly exposure of implementation detail what happens when you re write counter using closures to preserve state well then maybe the person who wrote counter should create procedure like make counter which calls make generator for the user but then everyone who writes generator needs to write constructor procedure hmm how could we solve this problem macro perhaps
there are still some graham pages left to be posted on reddit
it not an ugly exposure of implementation detail any more than say all python methods receiving an rather than self parameter is in other words think it is completely valid design decision the scoping is out in the open don understand your second objection post some code if you want to make it clearer edit okay think see what your objection is now with my implementation make counter would be defined as define make counter make generator counter how exactly is this tedious or in dire need of macrology keep in mind that there conceptual distinction between the guts of generator and the constructor of generator unfortunately python muddies the waters because of how procedures magically become generators as soon as you use the yield statement think following its footsteps in this matter would be bad idea you could factor out the details into higher order function if you were so inclined define maker gen proc lambda args apply make generator cons gen proc args define make counter maker counter define make counter look ma no macros btw big macro fan just tired of people making weak arguments in their favor
my husband could have written that article himself if he had deemed it worthy of the time as the wife of developer start up guy and good procrastinator the one left to do the interruptive errands in our life it often means become the bad procrastinator working on keeping up with the kids laundry job etc instead of my thesis you really have to be extremely patient friend neighbor or spouse to one of these driven people let hope it pays off for all of us in the end
how often would you want to expose the implementation details of counter almost never so why do you want programmer who writes generator to almost always define constructor procedure in few hours created generator facility that feels at least as baked in as python that wouldn be possible without little macro magic is there better interface for generators are generators good idea is there better abstraction for solving these sorts of problems glad use language that allows other people to easily explore these questions
this is exactly the case for me as well even though drawn to the hardest problem in the group of things to do find that things work much better if use working on the hard problem as the reward for having cleared out the smaller ones that otherwise not fiinish then if things go well when finally get around to the interesting problem have nothing more interesting still to do than implement it once ve solved it
there was an article about the pill up earlier thought this made good complement to it
how often would you want to expose the implementation details of counter almost never so why do you want programmer who writes generator to almost always define constructor procedure as already said don think it not really an implementation detail any more than explicit self parameters is do you consider those an implementation detail as well in few hours created generator facility that feels at least as baked in as python have you considered that making them feel as baked in as python is not really appropriate that what my muddying the waters comment was trying to suggest here macro wrote that makes creation of bindings more python like do you think this is appropriate for scheme http www cryptopunk com misc def scm
find that often naturally use procrastination of the thing find hard to do as leverage to take on that thing find hard to do which suddenly somehow becomes easy and fun strange isn it
the upside however is potentially enormous says miller proponent of menstrual suppression you can wear skirt with no underwear
forgot to reply to this is there better interface for generators are generators good idea is there better abstraction for solving these sorts of problems glad use language that allows other people to easily explore these questions just wanted to say that agree with this however you have to exercise care when designing macros that are used together with existing language constructs hidden parameters and the like break the user expectation of scheme scoping mechanism and should only be done if the alternative is way too inconvenient if you are designing embedded dsls using macros the rules are totally different of course also even if you take the macro route it is considered good style to factor out as much as possible into functions to keep the macro definition minimal in your article you also mention that it kind of inconvenient to have to specify yield as parameter to define generator if you are going for the baked in feel you can get around this by using non hygienic macros syntax case macros which most good scheme systems support
what find interesting about graham essays is that he so often approaches what are conventionally considered business or humanistic problems and approaches them from the point of view of programmer who has fair amount of business and life experience the insights are almost always worth my reading folklorist who has begun to think and write about similar topics starting from the humanistic perspective the dearth of interesting work by humanists on technology is just surprising little okay lot embarrassed for the academy come to reddit from reading graham essays and thanks to slashdot for first turning me onto graham and glad clicked on the comment link because think lot of people have raised important qualifications to graham schema most of these qualifications point out that all those level operations still must get done the fallouts are individuals who do only and never tasks in fact defer those tasks to others this is possible in work environment where there is staff to handle those tasks which is an interesting conundrum given graham argument that staff hired to handle tasks often in fact interrupt those who work on the tasks and hired them in the first place in order to defer the tasks in home environment task deferment falls to partner whom you can only hope doesn have tasks of their own know lot of successful academics mostly men who have very very patient and forgiving and lot of other things wives that tend to all the tasks individuals who only focus on tasks while perhaps achieving some level of greatness and or recognition are often individuals who are out of balance they are to put it less politely than some of the commentators here have assholes again my experience in the academy gives me plenty of examples to call upon so while we may admire their achievements it often the case not always that we also recognize that they are miserable human beings and plenty of people choose more mediocre life but one of relative happiness however you want to define the latter term sometimes and tasks are integral to getting tasks done as several posters put it sometimes doing something else is way of working on the task you were supposed to be working on all along both the poet wallace stevens and the linguist edward sapir one an accountant and the other an insurance underwriter by occupation are reported to have gotten their best work done during long walks so taskers who were occupied by tasks who got their tasks done while doing tasks finally my comment beyond my summary above is that the comments read actually many of which were by their own admission done as or level procrastination actually made the composite essay better one which was one of tim berners lee desires for the web in the first place so my thanks to everyone for allowing me time and place to read and to think little bit this morning while gear up to do my own work
maybe an idiot certainly am lisp beginner who doesn know jack about continuations or call cc what have to ask given this state of ignorance is why generator needs continuations wouldn it be sufficent to create function taking number which returns function that increments and returns the number and isn this entirely possible and quite transparent using lexical closures like said terrible beginner at lisp but think there even an example like this in my textbook
in the counter example that would be sufficient yes in general generators are closely related to streams however once you have something more complicated such as define walk tree yield tree unless null tree walk tree yield tree left tree yield tree data tree walk tree yield tree right tree your approach becomes more complicated to use you end up having to write the code at the yield boundaries in continuation passing form
another nice way to procrastinate

have read quite few of paul graham essays and have also read his book hackers and painters have to say that agree with most of what he writes the problem with the procrastination essay is that it seems to assume that most of us live in world where we can choose what to do would love to work on the big problems in my field am not afraid to tackle difficult problems the way the world works today however it seems that only projects that have early returns are viable if you have lot of money and you can work on whatever you want without worrying about money then the essay is right on but in the real world if you want to work on project you have to get funding good luck getting funding for big project that promises results in or more years the ones giving you the money always want results every few months you are forced to work on small problems just to prove that you are making progress even in academia you have to work on small problems so that you can write lot of papers people seem to think that it better if someone has written small project papers than if he has written one large project paper it would be great if we could work on big projects but the way corporations and academia work today you cannot do that you are forced to work on small projects to get results quickly in order to satisfy the ones giving you the money

point taken if had to discern from the reviews which movie he hated more it would appear to be wolf creek by slight margin guess guilty of inferring that he thought tcm was over the line even though he didn actually say it not trying to argue any point just find it interesting to observe roger as he occasionally puts adds movie to that over the line category the movie chaos that samf pointed out is another example actually much better example than tcm ll probably rent wolf creek sometime in the future just to see if agree with roger have feeling will that the funny thing about movies made just to shock they ll have made buck off of me just because wanted to see how depraved it was even though knew going in probably would not have liked it for what it worth thought the tcm remake was pretty weak overall
thanks for the link wasn aware of that movie yours is better example of what we re talking about think
ejb is still mess hence the effort to clean it up in ejb might be too late but good luck to them

rest http docutils sourceforge net rst html no awwwww
no you re not the only one ve had somewhat of the same reaction still enjoy the essays but they aren compelling to me in the way that some of graham earlier essays on language design were maybe it just the subject matter not very interested in starting startup someone who was trying to do so might find the essays on that compelling
have always followed the idea that event based design is best when the application is input bound such as io or gui apps as apposed to cpu bound they do not appear to address this consideration noone ever said threads are bad for everything
think paul doesn get the whole truth here while web is clearly buzzword it makes sense to analyze what the new breed of web apps have in common and is better than before it is not just ajax democracy and be nice to users one thing is he misses the apis but think there is better way to describe the difference initially web was about getting something out there that the whole world can use there is one to many relationship between your site and its users economically the difference from old businesses is that your front desk cost now is easily available for anyone and its cost is pretty much constant as the users grow your front desk is your site web is about using the network effects in your site the more your site is used the more beneficial it is for its users your site is not just connection between you and your users it is many to many connection between your users it is lot like bringing network effects like the ones we know from instant messaging on new platform the web why is the web suitable for this because there are already acccumulated solid and general mechanisms that make the web work and you can plug in yours more easily if you use things like rss rest json etc it is also easier for others to plug in to you this is how mashups come into play this is lot like preexposed and generalized democracy component being nice to users is necessary in the context of democracy because in such environment minor usability enhancements have compound effect to the bottom line that why ajax is necessary now that extra effort to make the site little more useful is actually worth it you need to enable users to be effective in your democracy because this affects the bottom line you need to be easily reachable which accounts for apis bookmarklets backlink tracking etc but think democracy is misnomer political democracy is about voting and have the majority win minority doesn get what it wants it is quite different mechanism that works with the long tail everyone should get what is suitable for him most web applications are not quite there but clearly this is the trend it is an interesting thought experiment to imagine implementing long tail kind of democracy politically neal stephenson envisions world of small districts with radically different laws in snow crash but it is not necessary to divide the laws by land so that you must obey different laws depending on your location you may have rights obligations and access to public services depending on set of laws you choose to be yours an important citeria would be the taxes you have to pay there are numerious problems with this of course
actually think issue of this was featured in the movie sneakers

according to the authors results the difference in popularity between the programming languages aren very big think it is lot more likely that the author methodoloy googling for written in lt language gt rather than lt language gt programming detects very sample
the perl script makes this well worth it
the analysis of kong has been done many times by far better anthropologists than me the primal male the primitive out of his element technology vs nature etc what thought was interesting about this version doesnâ have so much to do with these themes or jacksonâ retelling of them but of what the movie says about what technology can and should do in moviemaking and story telling
why would marketing company send check which they intended never to be cashed with real bank information account routing number magnetic ink etc on it if the check didn have this convenience information on it would the guy bank really have gone to the trouble to find out the marketing company account number and not noticed anything awry understandably you can retire on but it is odd that the guy is asking for donations and selling dvd maybe this story will be appearing soon on snopes
indeed in our secular society where political badge wearing serves as substitute for spirituality fair tradeâ seems to have reached the same hallowed status as the anti apartheid movement achieved couple of decades ago rather unfortunate analogy in an article attempting to argue troll that fair trade is counter productive you can almost hear the writer choking on his port
of course coldfusion hasn been called cold fusion for years so that could bias the results somewhat imo edit indeed if you use coldfusion without the space it goes up places in any case the name of the language is cfml

you can substitute windows the archetecture the qwerty keyboard or anything else that both mainstream and suboptimal for java and this would still be true people go with what mainstream and are slow to change don think the fairly rapid move from to java contradicts this as java is pretty logical evolution of not paradigm shift
what absolute muddled nonsense oxfam actually boasts that fair trade farmers are now being paid three times more for their coffee beans than non fair trade farmersâ this is precisely the sort of glaring income inequality which thought progressives always opposed yet here they are boasting about it depends whose incomes you re comparing so by propping up unwanted production the fair traders are actually driving down prices even further which increases the economic damage to farmers and workers guaranteeing prices to your supplier in exchange for reliable output is not propping up unwanted production it is especially misguided for fair traders to underwrite inefficiencies and poor quality when the major low cost highly mechanised plantations of brazil and vietnam or the specialised high quality farms of central america can meet the worldâ coffee demands so much more effectively no paying premium for higher quality product and presume the author would limit his notion of quality to attack this point is the sort of choice consumers make all the time should we limit ourselves to the author misguided notion of effectiveness
more chatter by the ror cheerleaders nothing to see here
paul seems to be using reddit to host his comment system now so presumably there won be for long
the author apparently missed the entire point of the essay was great sysadmin isn something want in my obituary system administration isn one of the great problems in cs so why do it the point is to do great things not be great at doing something and most people won do that so we ll have steady supply of sysadmins
clever in theory stupid in practice

why don you try and refute some of his points instead
hm enter string it says results but only shows results and java lang string is not among them
amp the point of the essay wasn to say that focusing on great project is good thing to do instead he was explaining something about procrastination as it relates to working on great project it also didn say that someone who completes great project is good person or even successful one general theme of paul writing is great projects and how to succeed at working on one the question wasn saying that you should conform to what your peers think important questions are it meant more that if you believe that what you re working on is less important than something else you could be working on you should be working on the more important thing thomas gold probably thought what he was working on was one of the most important problems in his field even if his peers didn also paul essay is more focused inward at how you can improve your own progress on great projects not that you should try to convince others to do the same
yeah right this is currently the playback feature of google video isn available in your country

man based on the comments ve read above mine think this must be the most content rich web discussion forum ve ever encountered what is the reddit secret why so many more smart participants than say slashdot anyway just like to add that ve been reading paul essays for years now and they ve almost all been uniformly great can even remember where first encountered him sent him an mail few months ago and he answered it even though sure he gets hundreds of mails per day ve been trying to think up second mail topic that might be interesting enough to garner another reply but haven yet those of you talking about exceptions to his putting off errands message are perhaps missing relevant experience to understand what he talking about someone said he had to put off tasks such as interviewing programmers for example to do level errands pretty sure that not what paul is talking about there are some types of work that are almost infinitely hard you can only work on such problems in long uninterrupted stretches of time and only when properly inspired certain types of computer programming are that hard for me if found myself in mood to tackle one of those hard problems then yeah would absolutely put off laundry changing the oil in my car paying the bills or anything else to put the work behind me if your field doesn require that sort of work from you guess envy you little bit because it really draining if so you are perhaps not someone that paul essay applies to if you guys like paul graham you re also liable to like john mccarthy the inventor of lisp recently ran across this story he wrote which found very enlightening the robot and the baby http www formal stanford edu jmc robotandbaby html truly excellent in all technical aspects but it also demonstrates that understanding human beings is perhaps not mccarthy strong suit heh
think that doing this becoming an indy programmer and making living through this is much better than writing open source software the big advantage is that you free yourself of the need of job you probably work as hard as before but at least you don have an idiotic boss and you work your own hours
surely anyone who is interested in this kind of thing would have already read this article is reddit becoming some kind of search engine
well chu according to at least people this was worth reading and promoting anyway the funny thing about his site is think it fits the concept well it is extremely useable and is simple much like reddit listening to users will get you the likes of digg which while not the ugliest website ever is not nearly as intuitive as reddit nor is it very original it just looks like bad mozilla clone which isn suprising considering that the designers of the mozilla site did digg there was time when digg was lot simpler and more useable but they went for beauty over simplicity and consequently lost both attributes
there really only one reason to deposit check into your back account this calls out to me as bsp blatant self promotion he pitches his book and services many times he described himself how obsessed he was the wsj article he knew what it would bring him good story but don be fooled he attempted fraud and decided that more money was to be made with pr for his business and probably also that he knew in court that he be guilty of fraud
in iraq and afghanistan the united states military has more than answered the challenge given it by routing the opposing armies apparently this is only partially true given that the taliban still control parts of afghanistan and the ongoing chaos in iraq

it even funny that someone cares to post blog about how java presumably won go anywhere soon it not something to presume it something obvious java is pretty strong in the web development field and it will remain so if you care to choose the right tools it joy and miles ahead of rails say this not as java fanboy but as someone with something more than visions of massive migration from ee to rails
exactly my original programs and the lisp and scheme translations are all available on our site and you can redo the benchmark yourself to verify the results apparently the results are significantly different on intel hardware anyone interested in other criticisms of my work reddit is lisp site after all might like to look at thomas fischbacher objections also check out juho snellman optimised lisp implementation that uses macro to help with unboxing greatly improving performance under sbcl cheers jon harrop
from my view the article over emphasizes the making part of wealth creation and under emphasizes the selling it two part process you make the stuff and you sell it then the wealth flows it not enough just to have users you need to actually sell your product alternatively you can aim to be bought out by larger firm in which case you re working in partnership with the larger firm and they re handling the all important selling part you re supplying ready made burgers to mcdonalds who are paying you cents burger and charging to the public whoever handles the sales component of the wealth creation typically recoups of the reward control the customer interface and you call the shots
ok what did do wrong the google link isn making anything any clearer
yes performance is clearly quite an objective measure and verbosity is clearly quite an inherently subjective measure originally used only loc but after much objection from the lisp and scheme communities also tried chars words tokens and so on basically this does not change the results and in particular the ordering of the languages remains the same ll put the other graphs up at some point cheers jon harrop

paul graham is clearly writing with target audience of people who want to start companies that use superior technology and agility through small headcount not system administrators so agree with brendan that said paul did seem to be heavily inspired by william golding as hobby_ perhaps shall have to mention that in the thread where paul essay was originally posted pdf http www com reading williamgolding pdf
there no mention here of why women might not want to lose their monthly period of thousands of years of cultural and spiritual signifigance of what might be lost if the feminine spirit breaks her connection to the moon just hey neato idea for the modern woman on the go
the modalities of procrastination came as no shock to me figured that out long ago what resonated with me was the part about interruptions very recently quit fairly decent job of years because my idiot boss never grokked the idea no matter how many times he claimed to understand there relationship between phoning me times day and asking why his secure financial system isn ready yet for while tried working in the wee hours of the morning and answering his stupid phone calls all day like my life back so quit now frankly it ll never get done not my problem any more envy people that can get paid to work without having to concentrate for hours or have long complicated setups and teardowns if ony working in petshop paid programming rates
the article and some of its comments go over the top in their praise of physical books but have to admit that share lot of their feelings and yes admit it new book sniffer the complete calvin and hobbes is probably being the most recent nice book that ve run across really like the binding and the simplicity of the covers and like the not quite white artist paper it printed on it really awesome book set of books rather otoh one of the great pleasures of electronic books is that you can have so many if rub my hands in glee after finding good book also rub my hands in glee when stumbing onto an archive of hundreds of thousands of books that can download at leisure and you can search the text of electronic books which is nice prefer an electronic dictionary to physical one though do have both
enjoyed it

that first one pretty crazy nice
in europe it is not that uncommon for woman to skip period from time to time by just continuing their contraceptive intake in europe contraceptive pills are provided in pill packs and you stop taking them for days rather than using placebo which from the article appears to be the case in the us so it is relatively easy to just go on to the next pack likewise users of the oestrogen only so called mini pill usually take these days cycle and have reduced or no period as result
paul if you re still reading this comment page interested to know how much this essay was influenced by william golding as hobby_ see lot of similarities in the three types of procrastination you describe and the three types of thinking mr golding describes if this is your first time reading it enjoy pdf http www com reading williamgolding pdf

gt literacy experts and educators say they are stunned by the results of recent adult literacy assessment which shows that the reading proficiency of college graduates has declined in the past decade with no obvious explanation no explanation skill comes with practice seems pretty simple both of my housemates have read approximately book in the past year maybe the deeper cause is that more students are attending university so you get increasingly wider range of students so you get more who don like to read which brings down the average an even deeper cause would include the words postliterate society
used to say my son and daughter are sampling music downloads but still buy music cds until realized they were only buying about as many cds as the used to buy before it became so easy to download songs the is good for the music industry is really myth unless the industry wakes up and does the itunes kinda thing

reddit like seeing articles like this current events non tech what like to know now is really the true picture of things illarionov seems like bright guy but perhaps bit too abrasive and too hard headed to work well with the slightly over corrupted government he probably pissed people off to the point where they just stopped listening to him regardless of whether he was right or wrong here another older interesting article about him http www businessweek com magazine content htm and his wikipedia entry http en wikipedia org wiki

did some back of the napkin figures and saw that compared to sampling of some of the books on my shelf the author expects to charge about percent premium for his book like now says in his her comment that percent charge to forego things like proof reader and copy editor if take percent off to reflect the value proofreading and copyediting provide not to mention factchecking and technical review our hypothetical author is coming somewhere closer to in the hole per book

one thing ve noticed is that the bulk of reddit content is usually it related or at least culturally related while digg is more generalized in its content perhaps this is product of time my point is that it seems to me that the fact that the who uses the site has greater influence on usability than how the site is used sidenote agree this is an august article are we in the gray area of social bookmarking and user driven news site

why is paul graham always so fixated on languages as long as you know basic concepts and are smart learning new language is easy of course it does take time to become highly proficient in language but excluding people because of their lack of experience with language doesn make any sense what makes even less sense is choosing the language for your projects based on what kind of candidates you will get by using that language

glad that is good for the music industry is myth nothing would please me more than watching the music industry implode do you think that britney spears and nickleback are so popular because they are just so good the death of the cd is good thing suddenly music can be distributed without any physical constraints and the market doesn rely on pushing superstars everywhere to everybody that means viable avenues for creative freedom and innovation of course the music industry wants to idolize cds it is much easier to monopolize physical product screw cds ll never buy another cd

in the beginning digg was pretty much all tech related links and whenever someone posted anything else you get flurry of this is tech news site type comments as the userbase grows and you get more diverse demographic using the site it becomes less elite and expands into other areas rarely see complaints about non tech news anymore the site has just become little more mainstream and diverse
the headline all by itself pretty much tells the story simple yet pointed insight fortunately wiser people than have already said that to be part of the internet discussion you can ask for money or for logging in just to read something poor nytimes

glad to see someone thought my post was worth reading although it was written months ago yes my blog post has plenty of bad writting and errors part of the reason write blogs is to help with my writting skills and you can see that need it but when publishing book could easily contract out that work and save myself lots of money and it wouldn be anything near the pdxmph suggests both proofreaders and tech reviewers are about each if you only sold books that per book for each service which is nowhere near the of book since the time wrote this post ve been contacted by couple authors that self published and not one has lost money granted none of these books sold anywhere near thousand copies but most tech books barely sell more then copies they all made more then what the major publishers where willing to give them as an advance which most authors know that is all they will ever see
here my reaction yukk william golding am an excellent thinker but everybody around me sucks if he really feels that way he should be applying his alleged excellent thinking abilities to positive optimistic topics rather than negative pessimistic ones such as this
wasn trying to say the proofreading and copyediting cost percent of the endeavor was discussing the notion that rather than being willing to pay percent premium for self published book strictly comparing page counts and prices which know isn exactly scientific be more inclined to deduct percent from the going price of book comparable in scope and content by wrox or reilly if had reason to believe that book wasn the recipient of professional editorial services speaking as sometime development editor with major publishing house all in favor of more stringent editorial process managed by people who are able to say no to self indulgent and cocky authors ve seldom had an adversarial relationship with an author but ve had few run ins that taught me the value of someone with real distance from the work and some control over cutting the checks having hand in the process speaking as published author preferred going with the publishing house because it let me put the book down when was done with it collect my check and move on to my next project with no accounting marketing or other worries

of course an author as writer would have biased opinion towards laying all the responsibility onto the reader there is also responsibility by the author to make sure the presentation of his or her ideas are distinguishable from their own beliefs many authors lack the clarity to do so cursory reading from wapo and the new york times can provide abundant examples of this to sum it up this coin has two sides
cds are just medium when they are truly deprecated idolization will become digitized monopoly of ephemeral product can happen depending on how good at marketing you are and with the money these guys have they can make it happen anti is just delay tactic while they figure out what to do with it whether there is an explicit plan or not
this is mentioned in the article coutinho as it happens also helped develop depo provera controversial injectable contraceptive that suppresses woman period for three months at time and is believed to cause serious complications in some women including significant loss of bone density women losing calcium is not fun
know what everything in that article was right on the money in fact he gave out all the answers to actually making money on the internet if someone was to adopt and integrate all of his suggestions and do it in way that consumers enjoyed and apprecaited without the feeling that they just got screwed then even would find way to pay to subscribe so sick of all these dumb who don realise that with the internet and the technology we have today the biggest change that is needed is the mindset for everyone involved and ing sorry we consumers don wanna spend the price for something when the person who actually put all the creative effort into the product gets the tinyiest slice of the profits don wanna give most of the profit to some fatass loser producer or some nerdy pimple ridden dude at the sales counter because both of them know less about the product trying to buy than do and besides that if theirs problem with my product and try to return it their the holes who won fix my problem or replace my item if go and buy something direct from the person who made it they get most of the profit they know all about the product so will be able to answer all of my questions and if have problem with the product they will take care of it for me and won have to beg and plead this creates consumer confidence and would return to buy stuff from them even if didn really need it and anyone who only see the bottom dollar and can see the bigger picture and you if don beleive that the consumers happiness is the most important factor in this whole process
didn read the article admit it am liberal and have problem with the source it is such fanatically liberal site that it does more harm then good it can be trusted because it spends more time inflamming opinion then asserting fact that said will say the same thing of certain news pundits on fox these news outlets put on heavy helping of opinion to try and attract as many like minded people as possible this is not informative it is inflamatory always reference jon stewart when he went on crossfire you people are hurting america

not fan of best buy by any means but have to agree with jedberg it seems that if there was real emergency because nature was calling the intellectual could have just asked the cashier to get him verified and out the door quickly but instead the author deliberately escalated the situation maybe its just me but haven been to an electronics store lately that did not check your receipt on the way out unless it was mom and pop operation in good part of town these kinds of situations can easily get out of hand if it kept escalating leading to damage injured persons or worse if somebody involved had gun the best buy guy followed the author out to his car big mistake both sides in the dispute were escalating recipe for disaster don try this at any shady camera shops in manhattan
meh whether you re being an ass or not the law on the consumer side oddly enough if you pay for membership at store like at sam club or costco they can make must stop at door for receipt inspection condition of membership that about it store anyone can shop at can stop you at the door to check your receipt they can ask you to stop but they can actually physically stop you agree completely with the author position if pay for something done have no need for security cronies following me demanding prove ve paid for it guilty until innocent doesn fly with me prove stole something from you had been in similar position the moment brute force or the threat of such was used to physically stop me from leaving have offered single warning to move away from me and clear my vehicle path inviting them to record my license plate but warning that car weighs lot more than human then if they refused have called the police myself and pushed as hard as could to have charges filed against everyone involved if this really happened the way the author describes the security minions at the store had already made so many mistakes in their handling of the situation that even if he had stolen the stuff they have had major trouble getting charges to stick it fine to follow the guy out to his car to ask him to return to the store everything that happened afterwards isn using your body to prevent person from entering their car to leave is form of detainment unlawful at that using your body to block the vehicle departure is similarly detainment the author really should have involved the police as soon as he saw the situation escalating too have shopped at stores that want to inspect my receipt at the exit ve thanked them for their interest and walked past them without presenting my papers every single time we do not yet live in society where we re guilty until we prove we re not and refuse to submit to little power trips like that incidentally you can still return something to store that marks receipts they inspect at the door even without the little inspection mark this probably sounds nasty but here the bottom line shoplifting and theft at stores like this is not my problem am not part of the problem and am not going to be willing participant in your solution if your inventory system is so broken that you really do have to count stuff sold as it goes out the door upgrade your inventory system if you have rampant shoplifting problem take effective steps to make identification and prosecution of thieves easier you discourage theft by making it unprofitable and personally destructive to the thieves not by inconveniencing and annoying your customers hassling people at the door is almost never successful and usually at least annoys people and in this case it was much worse and when you try it with someone who actually knows their rights you get incidents like this while those goons were chasing after paying customer countless others walked out the front doors without glance from the security guy who supposed to be pouncing people at the door for their receipts you can show whether that let another thief out the door but the customer the goons chased down turned right back around and whipped out that receipt not for proof of purchase but for want refund now purposes the store lost sale because of its behavior after it made the sale and the customer was out the door that pretty sad
you say this probably sounds nasty but here the bottom line shoplifting and theft at stores like this is not my problem am not part of the problem and am not going to be willing participant in your solution but thats like saying to the security guy at the airport security isn my problem not part of the problem so just going to mosey on through and take my seat you might be right and you re living by your principles but you could be dead too think staying alive is the wisest option unless you re really willing to take responsibility for the consequences of your actions ok so maybe thats little bit dramatic and over the top but you have to ask yourself is this really worth getting into an argument over am willing to pay the consequeces how far will go if they step it up notch in many situations the wrong answer to that question will result in even bigger problems even if you re right stand up for the things you believe in but choose your battles wisely

the articly is everything but fanatic it simple points out that news sources today often tell their readers viewers what they want to hear through small changes of words instead of being truly unbiased considering the number of deaths in the iraq war and the almost non existant reporting about the circumstances of those deaths am inclined to agree with the article

use vi too people are always surprised at this since lisp guy used to use emacs in college and the reason switched is similar to tim when got to grad school and tried to use to save file the froze the screen instead so pending figuring out what else was different downshifted to vi and ve used it ever since sometimes think using vi may have saved me from getting carpal tunnel syndrome don think all that chording is good for your wrists has anyone ever tried comparing rates of carpal tunnel problems in emacs vs vi users

agree that shoplifting is bad thing it needs to be stopped and it makes the baby jesus cry but if this happened to me and had to take leak like the author did also walk out ve done the same at sam club though simple no thanks unless you re saying criminal was sufficient and the security guy didn follow me to my car

think that gay marriage should be legal and don have problem with it hey more freedom for everyone say blatant disclaimer but just some notes for discussion think that hanging around people who are openly gay makes people more likely to act gay people tend to act like their peers understand there is strong political motivation against statements like that but sexuality is such social and physiologically complex thing more complex than simple yes no physical trait it seems somehow demeaning and at best dishonest to claim otherwise think we can all reasonably agree that social behavior is influenced by our social interactions that sounds obvious to me simply acceptable behavior is more expressed plus sexuality doesn seem to be clean straight gay division so think that more homosexual friendly society would give borderline people more options that is instead of only being willing to have straight relationships they would be free to have homosexual ones too how is that unreasonable marrying dog or child or car is absurd but this still opens some interesting why not questions for me at least comp sci guy not law guy if marriage is whatever consenting adults agree to why not polygamy why not an year old and year old legal but frowned on why not year free trial clause or marriage subscription that must be renewed every days why not interesting stuff
very nice essay one point of further consideration is that the advice in the essay probably does not apply to children children are generally right to explore many things and not worry too much about whether they are solving the hardest problems that exist or not any problem that helps them learn even one other people have already solved will do so the child playing video games instead of working on solving public good problems in economics or even just learning calculus probably isn doing anything wrong one parallel is that adults too shouldn worry overly about solving the hardest problems that exist as long as they are learning and making progress working on the hardest problems person can is all we can ever ask of him think it worth considering what other parallels there are and how to unify the theories of how children and adults should look at hard problems and procrastination elliot temple http www curi us

in the forum and blogging world it would be beneficial if more tools supported convenient and efficient automatic spell checking the fact that no major browser has incorporated native textarea spell checking thus far is travesty any of them could have killer feature if they simply added word like squiggly underlining of suspect words with easy alternative corrections as it is many tools have nothing at all and the few that do often host ridiculously unintuitive hacked in partial solution that the great thing about safari it does this automatically through os ve been trying to use firefox for its superior javascript support but miss this feature so much going to end up switching back another thought don think this makes me more literate or better speller since tend to memorize fewer words and just let word google or mac os correct me certainly though it results in less errors when otherwise be too lazy to check

thoughtful and enjoyable there is one issue that is sticking point for me the text reads when talk to people who ve managed to make themselves work on big things find that all blow off errands and all feel guilty about it don think they should feel guilty this is quite possible but think there may be complex internalized strife where they are able to chanel the guilt and into the project for instance person may feel guilty about not performing an errand and to further substantiate avoidance of that errand come up with critical questions that may be flung at their work an attempt to make the work as watertight as possible against rebukes for not having performed other tasks sort of answering these questions then takes the person to the next level of development one that might not have been achieved without the negative energy that is channeled into constructive and sometimes obsessive analysis of ones work

no that not what he saying from each according to his abilities implies that you should should work as hard as you can creating things of value for society that exactly the sort of work ethic that russell argues against what russell is saying this if there exists moral obligation to do work it is to fill the needs of ourselves and others however since the advent of industrialism the needs and desires of society are far less than the amount of value that we create by doing work thus there is no feasible moral obligation to work as hard as is socially accepted furthermore russell argues overworking ourselves at unpleasant tasks causes unuseful misery so if we all worked less at our jobs we be happier and have more time and energy for enjoying ourselves this implies that if morality is focused on increasing the happiness of society and decreasing its misery then we have moral obligation to work less

my school recently switched to java cs curriculum from very thankful that made it before the switch because hate to be one of those kids who learns java and then has to take an operating systems course which as joel mentioned is just not possible without working knowledge of
agree with brendankohler can stand how joel seems to insist upon high gpas and elite schools is he running an investment bank or software development shop shouldn he be looking for creative people that can brainstorm new products can see how high gpa and an elite school can fit that mold this criteria seems to fit too many kids who are killing themselves to please their parents and professors they don seem to be creative people who can take mature technology and use it in new way think joel is not being able to see the different perspectives that are needed in producing good product he is concentrating too much on one dimension of his candidates btw think smalltalk is the best language for teaching software development it provides good foundation in oo principles and is very easy to learn
waaaayyy back in when took operating systems we didn even have we used apl which at the time was the interpretive language ibm was using to write all of their oss objects bah functions feh display terminals ptooi
it java here as well but haskell in the second semester germany and nothing well cmos logic in the third very funny to get an introduction to pointers with javas arrays
personally would go with scheme asm smalltalk and maybe haskell that way you grok exps macros hardware objects and types lazy eval if had to eliminate one language from that it would be smalltalk because scheme could do the objects but think it is entirely reasonable to teach languages in the course of year curriculum read somewhere that there is cs course somewhere in which the students do an assignment every few weeks each time in different language anyone know where that is taught as an aside omit perl python ruby because they tend to be rapid uptake languages and they are fairly popular anyway better to expose the kids to something they might not see otherwise unless you are trying to teach vocational degree in which case java is probably good call as is cobol
part of the problem here might be the fact that you already have been exposed to some of his other works many ideas and concepts even his style of writing which initially seemed compelling are now old news although think that is part of the problem for me some of his articles are starting to feel rushed my most prominent example is how to fund startup which felt more like an encyclopedia entry than the entertaining discourse to which am accustomed

think the most interesting point in the essay is that joel wants to hire people from eg duke but is worried about doing so because it is hard to tell the duke students who don understand recursion because they have only coded in java from the duke students who just aren smart enough to recurse this is supposed to be part of what college is for but since the cs depts are dropping the ball there is niche open for sort of devry for cool languages and techniques where you can prove competence in scheme haskell asm etc instead of with java the placement rates post graduation for such an institution would probably be excellent assuming anyone passed guess it would have to be set up like certification or something similar because the size of the student body would not justify school scale operation perhaps local language organizations like lispnyc and bothton would be the proper vehicle
iowa state university while fine place in many ways teaches java to cs freshmen in such boringly basic way that joel words on taking multiple choice quizzicles on the difference between polymorphism and overloading rang very true if you want good introductory programming class at isu try ee it teaches programming for ee freshmen and it well done if had my way the cs introductory class would use sicp and water it down as much as necessary instead of this silly java monkey factory class they feed the cs students
find this article bit frustrating at least agree with him on the values of teaching pointers and functional languages but trivializing software engineering concepts and dismissing them to be nothing more than memory games that bit reckless correct me if wrong but it sounds like he complaining about how there lack of challenge in the obstacles used to train the code commandos that he deems fit for hiring hr drones what about the drones earlier in the assembly line who are at the mercy of academic opinion question do arrow down if think this shouldn go on the hot page or if think the article is crappy
paul graham essay reminded me of perry essay as well list of other light essays including one like called plea for the horizontally organized by john perry is at http www csli stanford edu john light html
was reminded of this essay when read paul graham essay on good procrastination http paulgraham com procrastination html
yes amnesty international are being targeted as anti foreigner and racist
same can be said about assembly code courses always thought that having deep understanding of now outdated cpu architectures puts solid floor under all your understanding is still high level language after all think you need to go deeper for university course pointers are an abstraction and functional courses are good but when went we did the functional stuff first which was near impossible would have preferred it the other way around but perhaps the idea was to scare people
this is kind of reworking of some of joels old articles but he has thrown in recursion now think that says something about the rise of functional languages of late in terms of mainstream awareness don think he has mentioned it before
funny and sad after norman schwarzkopf pointed out cheney stupidity how did the guy stay in public life
very interesting article however don agree with their method of measuring peace by simply measuring the number of armed conflicts gt by there were percent fewer conflicts than gt in the deadliest conflicts those with gt or more battle deaths fell by some percent that fine but that doesn tell me jack about the overall number of deaths and casualties what worse conflicts with deaths each or conflicts with deaths each what worse minor terrorist attacks say anthrax letters or single terrorist attack with deaths and is single world war with tens of millions dead better than local wars with deaths each really dunno and actually doing such cold math with human lives is kinda scary and distasteful so that not my point my point is that would prefer that we measured peace not by measuring the number of conflicts you can be killed in but rather by measuring your overall chance to avoid being involved into any conflict during your lifetime plus your average chance of surviving conflict once you do get involved into one

whatever happened to hard work no doubt why are people hiring high gpas to build low hanging fruit like bug trackers what happened to tackling hard work seriously the point of the newer fabber languages it to get the language out of the way of doing the hard work as in not adding to it it odd that he used low level language like and mixed it with very high level language like lisp which is full of those abstractions that joel used to not like but has somehow changed his tune in the last few months the title of this article should have been ok guys started actually reading what paul graham had to say even included him in book of mine had him over for dinner and no longer going to talk smack about functional programming languages predict more scheme lisp articles from joel

that is commonly believed but not accurate is fairly bad assembler as can be testified by anyone who has compiled basicly any functional language to it is fairly hard to support multiple value return continuations are bit of bear and fast function call interfaces such as those used by ocaml are not possible at least not portably for something to be an assembler you would want to be able to get at the stack which you cannot do directly in java is even worse as an assembler and it gets used as an assembler sometimes dearly hope that it does not become the de facto standard assembly the way has it limits implementors in much the same way that semantically poor languages limit the programmer and limiting the implementors hurts all of us as to low level teaching languages perhaps it would be useful to have teaching architecture like mmix or the apple ii or the amiga all of them are probably understandable by single person and they are all lot simpler than most current chips well maybe not risc ones but surely
that is an excellent point it funny how functional programming is in the air now lots of surprising people have commented on how it is win or just dropped references to it wonder which functional language community will pick up on the appropriateness of the moment and run with it maybe haskell haskell has simon peyton jones at msft and autrijus tang and ton of the smartest perl guys the phenomenon of being in the air is itself very interesting see it bit in essays http opal cabochon com stevey blog rants why you should blog html and once in fiction in the fountainhead pg or js should write an essay on things being in the air how to smell it first etc

enjoyed the essay it reminded me of passage in the book am currently reading the midnight disease http books google com books the midnight disease the book contains whole section on procrastination pp and the passage remembered is on page attempts to improve time management fail because the procrastinator generally knows exactly when he should be doing what but simply cannot bring himself to do it it struck me that this passage and graham essay point to the underlying problem with most procrastination in my mind at least of being overwhelmed having the thoughts vacuumed out of one head by the problem and rarely is the problem not knowing what needs to be done personally however find to do lists helpful in both remembering which problems currently have to work on while admit often these include errands they include the occasional big problem big idea and the attempted solution or implementation of the problem idea inevitably gets worked out outlined in series of to do lists perhaps my definition of to do list is bit off though really in some cases it is more of an outline nonetheless the midnight disease is good book and definitely different sort of manual for writers think ll return to reading it now instead of posting muddle headed comments
no definitely ruby instead of python ruby has real lambdas for the functional stuff and continuations for the scheme fans let the language wars begin think lisp and smalltalk should be taught at some point early on because these are the classics then point out that between the invention of lisp which is getting to be about years old now and smalltalk which is what about years old now til now there really hasn been much in terms of new programming paradigms invented really think what we re seeing in lot of cases is that the schools have become java schools lot of schools haven been teaching the classics for quite some time now because they ve essentially become vocational schools

the hot page is meant to reflect what is hot and it up to the readers to decide what goes there if an article reappears after few weeks and is voted up then think that it is best to let it be clearly it is new interesting to enough people to make it hot stuff and it doesn hurt those who have seen it before to simply ignore it in my opinion flagging articles as duplicates serves only to draw acclaim to the original poster for finding it first this seems to me an idea which would focus rather too much on rewarding posters rather than simply getting on with the job of indexing interesting links as see it some articles sites are simply good enough that they deserve to be re posted every so often happen to agree with the consensus within the comments that this is not one of them but that beside the point

in this article joel isn putting forward an opinion on whether or not lisp well scheme actually is good language for practical purposes he saying that it good test of overall mental prowess hence it not really at all odd that he used both and scheme as examples both are challenging in their own way and can be used to root out non mediocre programmers

so we have two concepts curriculum content and ways for differentiating between good and bad programmers in the context of an interview next we ve got focus on pointers and recursion with love for and disdain for java ok legit or not understand here where need help how is recursion off limits in java if recursion is concept that many people just never really fully comprehend can we solve part of the differentiation problem by asking java only programmer to implement recursive function in an interview the absence of pointers get the absence of recursion don not being snide just trying to figure out if even know what dont know

recursion is crippled in java because java does not do tail call optimization if you wrote some java that did this pardon my lack of correct java syntax length list int acc if isempty true return acc else return length next acc you would eat an number of stack frames proportional to the length of the list if it is circular list you would run out of stack does anyone know what java does in this case in scheme you would use constant amount of stack because it is trivially provable that the return value of the function is just going to be passed up the stack anyway so no new stack frames are allocated the same one just gets recycled you can do this even if you have multiple functions calling one another because recursion is so crippled in java relative to scheme no one uses it in java compared to the situation in scheme it like lambda in python it there but so borked that it is rarely used think this is not an implementation issue but rather spec issue ie java is specified not to do tail call optimization any language lawyers in the house know the answer on that
it easy to start working on something because it convenient but you should always be questioning yourself about it is there something more important you can work on why don you do that instead such questions are hard to face up to eventually if you follow this rule you ll have to ask yourself why you re not working on the most important problem in the world but each little step makes you more productive contrast hamming it not the consequence that makes problem important it is that you have reasonable attack http www paulgraham com hamming html
shit reddit ate my code how do you post code snippets
in general agree know thing or two about recursion but hardly anything about pointers self taught programmer of seven years but realize these deficiencies and so read books like writing great code by the inventor of high level assembler and database in depth by date and thereby hope differentiate myself from most of todays cs grads if you program in java you had damn well better understand pointers or rather you had better understand java references which are safer than style pointers but which still have the same potential for problems with referential transparency and weird side effect mazes this is important in almost all languages you can only truly escape it if you use purely functional language like haskell and then only if you don use the special syntax for imitating side effects with state transition monads but program in java and there are some weedout concepts interfaces being the one that first springs to mind once heard interfaces called architecture enablers and maybe that is the difference between java and the previous languages that were taught in cs courses you think that interfaces are difficult concept to grasp they just reflect the common oo practice of making similar objects support the same methods for certain purposes they re not even the best way of doing it why doesn java allow you to specify that some variable must implement multiple interfaces haskell type classes which are very similar to interfaces allow this so it can be too difficult to type check and the syntax wouldn be too hard to understand not having to worry about pointers allows one to more quickly get to the point of being able to architect solution guess what sicp which uses scheme as teaching language doesn get to anything even vaguely pointer like until chapter and there are only chapters there are plenty of other languages which have less pointer crap to worry about than java and are easier to learn too so students can get into the difficult concepts faster instead of dinking around with the syntax of for loop your ignorance is showing and you don seem to realize it please learn scheme and ml it should be an eye opening experience for you just be sure you hire java programmers who grok interfaces and for heavens sake stay away from php coders any java programmer who doesn even understand such simple concept as interfaces shouldn be hired agree however fail to see the problem with php coders if someone knows only php of course they should probably be avoided but php is decent language for certain things it also terrifically easy to learn if you already know some other languages in the family picked up enough php in few minutes to write simple database and email script and not genius
he not saying that java is bad because it can do recursion he saying that young people given choice of language to implement problem will choose java because that what they know because lots of colleges are teaching everything in java and it lot easier to skate by without really learning how to be good programmer because java never requires you to use difficult concepts like pointers or recursion and the schools that teach with java generally fail to find other ways to either weed out the people who can handle it or actually teach them to be really good programmers this might mean that joel has to deal with more resumes from mediocre programmers but don think he is saying that he can judge someone in an interview in fact he doesn even say that he is personally having to wade through more bad programmers or that people shouldn use java when they interview with him it just the jumping off point where he observes that more people are more familiar with java than they used to be why this is and what he thinks it means
this is intresting idea
really great one
but it sure did provide nice revenue for organized crime and jobs for police
let me let you in on dirty little secret at mit the same place where we teach scheme and to freshmen we teach java for the upper level software engineering course heavens why because for many of the principles of software engineering data hiding code reuse taking advantage of standard libraries in particular unit testing it is most appropriate know that there are those of you in the back of the classroom who snicker when you hear the phrase software engineering you enjoy your functional language and have great disdain for java bet that those of you who hold that viewpoint don work on many software projects that are too large for you to have written yourself or on large bodies of legacy code where half of the original authors of the codebase are now at another company so you can no longer ask them what their code does when you start to find yourself in this situation it more helpful to do defensive programming than daredevil programming reference shouldn be changed or method shouldn be overridden then declare it final in java so the new guy who is working on the codebase can override it you can do that in lisp because that not lisp philosophy data and code are so nothing is really hidden if you cdr enough times finally there are many ways to think abstractly certainly pointers and recursion aren the only ones good interviewer should be able to discern candidate abilities without taking sides on his or her language preferences
good interviewer should be able to discern candidate abilities without taking sides on his or her language preferences agreed believe you must pick the best language for task and not force task to particular language the latter would be disastrous furthermore at an interview am most interested in how people think and not whether they have the right or wrong answer to question pose
have you tried doing whois on the domain name and perhaps finding direct email address that way its worth shot
you might be good guy to ask this then what exactly is software engineering if it data hiding code reuse and unit testing then don see how that is qualitatively different than developing at repl in any language that supports functions and closures closures hide data functions reuse code and repl allows you to test bits of code at time is it just more of the above as far as java being the best language for software engineering that is an interesting statement know of bunch of very large systems written in too many to list and some in lot of windows for one and some in various lisps axiom macsyma genera emacs but the only loc thing can think of in java is eclipse or maybe java itself is there some other big java codebase and what features of java do you think make it good for have been told that the package system is very nice but never why that is so
it can even translate the most basic sentences correctly try translating yesterday went to the movies into language of your choice the only translation can identify as correct is the french one but then again as far as understand this is merely supposed to be an ajax proof of concept rather than an actual translator
when program in lisp language noted for making widespread use of recursion normally do not write tail recursive functions this is true to lesser extent even in haskell most tail recursive functions are instances of broader patterns which have already been identified and abstracted out so just use the abstractions the place where recursion really shines even in languages which have all the common patterns abstracted out is in manipulation of tree data structures this sort of code usually doesn lend itself easily to tail call optimization but it usually also doesn create too many stack frames say that the real reasons people don use recursion as much in java are these there widespread uneasiness about using recursion because it commonly seen as very slow and prone to stack overflows this doesn have to be true and in many languages it isn but in java there is some cost to recursion but this isn reason to avoid recursion in general since the speed penalty is usually negligible lots of people just don get recursion it is with considerable scorn that note this since recursion seems so easy recursion is often taught as scary thing beware my students and have your wits about you for today we re going to learn about dark and scary thing called recursion it slower than iterative versions and it often hard to understand feeeeeeeaaaar

number in particular points out what condescending dovchebag this guy is
think he meant successful in the sense defined in the hundred year language that language would influence many successors lisp and algol are very successful languages in this manner in that algol ish syntax has dominated pretty much all of the mainstream languages for long time and lisp semantics have been ported over tiny piece at time to other languages java did not have much technical innovation so it will not get the type of success that lisp did nor will it have algol type success because it syntax is not all that new instead it has cobol type success it is used by tons of programmers to write tons of code make of that what you will but it is not the sort of success that graham is talking about

personally would define software engineering as managing large software systems and by large mean too big for an individual person to be completely familiar with didn try to claim that java is the language for software engineering arguing that it has properties that make large codebases easier to manage hence better vehicle for teaching software engineering yes functions reuse code and every language has some idea of function subroutine method what have you but think that the standard library that comes with java has much more to offer than what you get with other languages you ll notice that it is quite consistent in terms of naming conventions and other things which is impressive for library of its size this is code reuse on larger scale than we see in other languages another property that helps with managing large codebases is namespaces without namespaces it is difficult to produce large codebase and be certain that there won be naming collisions if you need to make it work with another large codebase suppose your software company acquires another one for example again this isn problem that you and your buddies face when hacking together talking about something on larger scale than that concede that the repl is huge tool which is why use the drjava plugin for eclipse when use java hate the name but it allows me to execute java statements and try things out without creating throwaway class with main method shamelessplug if you re javascript hacker then you may want to check out my chickenfoot extension for firefox which offers something of repl for javascript plus lot more shamelessplug the tools for refactoring in java have become very good as said use eclipse which is also important when it comes to managing large codebases in most languages if you want to rename variable in your code then you run perl minus pie to rename it everywhere cross your fingers and hope that you didn break anything with tools like eclipse you can do that renaming such that you know that you haven changed the behavior of your program renaming variable may be weak example extracting methods interfaces are more compelling refactorings that eclipse can do but it not as clear what the analogue is in some other languages which is why used the renaming example this is not to say that such refactoring tools could not exist in other languages in particular functional programming languages but haven seen them yet because java is bit of control freak to the dismay of real hackers creating such tools is easier to do for java there is certainly fair bit of research going on to make analogous tools in other languages but until they come to fruition think that teaching java with eclipse is better way to teach software engineering was ta for for three semesters at mit and started the movement from emacs to eclipse since eclipse made it so easy to run unit tests and interact with cvs which think are also important practices for software developer thought it was clearly the way to go as you can imagine some students faculty thought otherwise but that whole different discussion for the record no student or faculty member was forced to use eclipse in students have always been free to use whatever tools they want you can bet that we had and will continue to have die hards who insist on using emacs and checking in their code from the command line ve forgotten the kb flag enough times to convince me that it isn the way to go but that just my opinion
well said
lame whoever voted for this go away to digg please
couldn help but think of doug engelbart and how he asked himself how can my career maximize my contribution to mankind think that falls right in line with hamming question and it something think about quite bit of course like some of the other posters suffer from not having enough spare time
now naturalized us citizen can attest to ins arrogance first hand ruthless insensitive unhelpful high handed primetime something is done about ins pity ins victims have no voice in us
great reply thanks as to technical points just about every package system has namespaces python perl and common lisp all do so think just about every language community has figured out that they are good idea heck even scheme is adding package system for rs is java different somehow as to your experience in the are the students allowed to use other languages or merely other dev environments do you know when and why they switched from to java
like how the article equates alcohol prohibition to insider trading and says that should be allowed too the whole article is about how despite reducing alcohol consumption it created more problems than it solved to judge it we must look at all the effects but in the intro the author implies that nothing should be economically prohibited so much for weighing costs and benefits
tolerated in the sense they don seem to be actively aggressively clamped down on out of according to more than few source some sort of fear from the academic study cite above public policy in sweden often lenient on such culturallyâ motivated crimes has come under new round of criticism widespread condemnation of the murder occurred although it has not obscured the tendency among nationalists to downplay such crimes is honor killing part of kurdish culture or is it religious islamic phenomenon there are now sizeable kurdish communities in europe and north america especially in germany britain france and sweden while these states have readily declared the kurdistan workers party pkk to be terrorist or criminal organization some have not criminalized male terrorism against women the policy of respect for cultural differences is often paved with good intentions however we have learned from two centuries of democratic development that group identityâ and culture should not be the basis for the exercise of state power how can one have any respect for any culture that endorses violence against women in fact such respect subverts its goal it ends up in racism rather than anti racism are you seriously saying you don see how such link might inform my position if you have some references that could help me see things differently they be much appreciated
this article is written like would think opening neighborhood coffee shop would be great idea but really wouldn so the guy just sounds like moron to me
doesn mean the threads aren native just look at stackless
sure that is but the fact that there was remote root out there for ie for of is not surprising knew it was bad but not that bad
definitely an interesting and refreshing approach ve always liked the fact that dhh considers rails opinionated software and realizes that he can please everyone he creates what he wants and thus avoids bloat and unecessary complexity
gt is it religious islamic phenomenon according to wikipedia honour killing is forbidden by sharia and may have roman and european origins gt germany britain france and sweden while these states have readily declared the kurdistan workers party pkk to be terrorist or criminal organization some have not criminalized male terrorism against women while these countries have their own legal systems think that you ll find that they all prohibit terrorism gt tolerated in the sense they don seem to be actively aggressively clamped down on out of according to more than few source some sort of fear it looks like you are confusing op ed with the criminal justice system
you get more of an idea of the museum in the virtual tour at http www collphyphil org virt_tour museum htm page has conjoined twins http www collphyphil org virt_tour museum_ htm
seriously doubt you judge institutions solely on policy sure hope you are correct that such crimes are aggressively being prosecuted and that cultural leaders are acting to prevent further harm from coming to these women
why do big companies keep threatening little guys who write positive things about them
well this is really neat app the content of it is not perfect ie the actual translation quality but the mechanism of on the fly translation is cool thing english to french was horrible

so spent minutes of watching guy say yes to get to the funny part of guy cussing what are we agree go back to digg
neat trick but my first impression is that would rapidly find it annoying when trying to click through lot of images on site
uh so you show the image and then your users click back because that what they re used to and then they ve left your page brilliant

this stuff is good to know just in case
think it is important to mention that one of the most important benefits of procrastination is that you can sometimes gets someone else to do the errands for you if you procrastinate long enough this results in your being able to do the big stuffâ while someone else spouse or family member squanders their life doing the small stuff
yeah very unbiased gearing up for
excellent concept
democracy it sounds more like communism and the web its the manifest soon tobe explode in the face of thier belivers cant see why the big players will not perssue to to be monpolist in this game google is sharping it claws and soon we all gonna feel it
yes why post articles that are over months old this isn news anyway the situation now is that after couple of high profile examples such as this journalists now apply for visas did ve got one took about minutes once got through the queue at the us embassy cost think but it lasts for the lifetime of my passport years have no sympathy for these people virtually every country in the world has special visa rules for foreign journalists if you re going in under tourist visa then don tell immigration that you re journalist hardly rocket science
an awesome collection reminds me of the classic pattern language towns buildings construction book by alexander et al

even scheme you say nifty guess that only leaves javascript without packages or namespaces which big pain with respect to all the ajax stuff going on recently in terms of existing package namespace systems can speak to all of the languages you list but right now looking at the java api http java sun com se docs api index html and trying to compare it to the equivalent python api to see how its packages are organized but not sure whether the python library reference http docs python org lib lib html is what looking for if this is the right site then python packages sure appear more disorganized than java classes in java packages can also have data members that can be only accessed by other classes in the same package not sure if the languages you list add that ability as part of their package system finally no students must code in java for grading student code is difficult enough as it is can imagine what it would be like if we let students write in any language such variety would be nightmare for our automated test suite and the other tools we use to help with grading which are written in python incidentally don know what you mean by but believe that the last language that was used for was clu which is language that was invented at mit it was one of the first if not the first languages to focus on data abstraction and told it had nice iterators and exception handling so suppose this was good choice for back in the day my best guess as to why they switched to java in the late believe is that it looked like java was going somewhere and clu wasn which certainly turned out to be true because of the switch students have been able to make some fantastic final projects since they can leverage third party libraries written in java such as opengl which is lot more fun than doing project without such libraries also think it important that there is at least one course in the cs curriculum that exposes students to tools that people use in the real world cvs eclipse as opposed to tools that were made for and by mit edwin the scheme editor
hey mofo be good netizen and stop pimping your own site

from the article but take look around the crowd at racing track does an uncannily good job of forecasting the outcome better in fact than just about any single bettor can do horses that go off at to odds win quarter of the time horses that go off at to win seventh of the time and so on does the author realize that the odds are set by the bookees and the bettors are losing that doesn support his argument at all
wow he really seems to miss the point that stroustrop has never intended as purely object oriented language and wouldn espouse what he saying the everything must be an object madness came mostly when all the smalltalk zealots latched onto java as fix for which is supposed to be oop procedural assembly if you need it plus functional if you like templates his criticism is right on target vis vis singletons buy why lambaste stroustrop for someone else crime
was thinking more that in judaism sex isn the original sin

chu just can quite get my head around your comment gt according to wikipedia honour killing is forbidden by sharia and may have roman and european origins your re begging the question here obviously the ban isn very effective at least in pakistan and who cares about the western origins of honor killing never mind that you must have to go back years when the practice is so abhorrent to westerners now the question remains unaddressed what could possibly motivate hundreds of men to slaughter their dishonored daughters like this
hmmm wonder what you re alluding to for one voting this down
please his main bone of contention seems to be that singletons are stupid because he used to do stupid things with them used them for things they shouldn have been used for then he discovered static methods which made him realize that he was using singletons stupidly excuse me which made him realize that singletons are stupid wow what superb programmer with such well thought position

really thought sergey went to university of maryland and didn omid kordestani go to san jose state what about alan eustace didn he get his phd from the university of south florida my point is that limiting yourself only to certain types of candidates from certain elite schools is shooting yourself in the foot too many attributes that make up successful person are not measurable joel seems to ignore that fact does joel think that college admission board is able to determine the full life potential of seventeen year old person one other thing how many women work for joel only saw pictures of men that participated on that aardvark project went to all male private schools and for one appreciate at the very least the calming influence on the male ego when woman is present during meeting especially during code review session
gt your re begging the question here well wikipedia is gt obviously the ban isn very effective so obviously these people are not that influenced by islam gt and who cares about the western origins of honor killing never mind that you must have to go back years the point is that honour killings have been widespread in many societies throughout history it not an islamic or arab thing gt the question remains unaddressed what could possibly motivate hundreds of men to slaughter their dishonored daughters like this it good question we know it not islam and we know that it has happened in many societies do you have theory
when are people going to get over the whole am an angry dad distrust my daughters so much that must intimidate others to force her to behave thing was never funny was never clever few times was given little talks by the fathers of girlfriends while in high school lived in nebraska so those all meant they showed me their gun collection at some point during the gettting to know you talk if was to the point that was dating their daughters and thus subject to the introductory chat chances are had already had sex with their daughter really it just gave me incentive to convince them to have sex with me on their parent bed still few years from having kids of my own and many more before have child old enough to date but hope am not so big dick to make it point to intimidate with threats of physical violence any boy my daughter might date and that why feel john ritter got exactly what he deserved
this is how the left needs to approach political elections as marketing to different segmnets using correct media for each
all it needed was some poop jokes and monkey
consumers buy crap that is of absolutely no practical use to them and is sometimes even harmful to them every day this is ridiculous statement while it is strictly speaking true certainly at least one consumer buys something useless every day it is misleading because almost all transactions are beneficial to both parties otherwise they wouldn be made just because think someone else doesn really need something doesn mean it true the idea that people can take care of themselves is central part of certain mythology this same mythology also leads people to think how could people possibly vote for right wing party they simply must be brainwashed there is no other explanation wake up people there actually are conservatives in the world who believe in their philosophy
this is great reference to keep handy for all those times you hear someone name the aclu as part of the secular war on christianity defending the right to sing awesome god at talent show or the right to preach on street corner in vegas are not exactly consistent with conspiracy to destroy christianity it would be nice if some of the entries had somre more details or at least link to the specific case though
relax it funny
have never been fan of dell quality but of late it seems to have taken turn for the worse they wouldn need to do support on the cheap if they had reasonable products stop buying dell people please think of the children
yeah for things like web apps really like the opinionated approach only really one way to do things suffer from analysis paralysis when faced with too many choices in in domain like database backed web apps all the hard problems should have been solved in the past by someone more thoughtful then me so appreciate the fact that am forced to think and work there way its not an approach that is applicable to all areas of application development just web apps in my opinion
look at the author creditials looks like pure propaganda to me do you really believe everything you read without question and without consideration for context if you really want to verify the truth check out global human rights watch website not saying that these figures are wrong per se but considering points and suspect this article was printed at this time to boost confidence in your government if amount of people were murdered last year and less than was murdered this year does it therefore follow that murder is ok guess we can all feel good about the world in that case carry on
am an angry dad distrust my daughters so much they don distrust their daughters they distrust you the difference is vital
ugh it dynamically scoped haven worked with dynamic scoping much but don envy people trying to serious work in it edit yeah yeah the compiled version is lexically scoped should have read the next line don think it is good approach though
it good question we know it not islam and we know that it has happened in many societies do you have theory uh could it be that some men are psycho control freaks and any excuse will do
how dare you not obey my every demand and refuse to worship the ground walk on you do not do these things ask of you therefore the flying spagetti monster requires kill you
this is kind of old funny but old do we really need to post everything that was passed around in by chain letters
the pharmicutical industry is corrupt beyond belief just google big pharma for more info than you could read in lifetimes
there seems to be problem right now
the difference between the left and the right is that the right actually respects the left as an adversary and that is why they win
yes there are legitimate skeptics of strongly typed oo languages like graham now comes their legion of php using teenagers who just wanted reason to feel superior to people who ve at least actually read gof
from the docs gt the main differences between lush and clush are as follows gt gt clush uses lexical scoping while lush uses dynamic variable binding if you don know the difference don worry so it is lexically scoped if you re using compiled lush otherwise it dynamically scoped
this is great reference to keep handy for all those times you hear someone name the aclu as part of the secular war on christianity yeah if you want to amuse others with your gullibility in buying these examples of cynically calculated exceptions to the rule the aclu is reprehensible
ve noticed that real sysadmins bitch about dells considerably less than your average cis student because of this am inclined to think that people choose dell to complain about not because they have more problems than competitors at the same price points but because they are the most popular and are therefore an obvious target
the fur flying between microsoft and ibm lotus execs over who groupware is better advantage you if you want to know where each group hides its best research and how the other side debunks it
it may be old but it was discussed for an hour or more on jerry springer air america talk show recently some folks took it seriously especially from the south
yes and it looks like they had good reason not to trust you
again relax it funny sheesh
