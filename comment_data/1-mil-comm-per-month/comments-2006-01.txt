this is exactly the same behavior as the very early lisp dialects they had dynamic scoping in the interpreter and lexical scoping in the interpreter wonder if they knew about the history or not
because this one is different and like it better here your sign

looking forward to the reaction from the id crowd if this succeeds

my interpretation of the article was more that the singleton pattern is used as crutch by many programmers to be able to claim that they understand object oriented programming and design patterns this is something have seen many times myself when interviewing people and also in lot of code where the singleton pattern is as the article describes very often used in places where it is completely unnecessary it not that the singleton pattern is stupid per se but that it has become the most obvious symbol of how people misunderstand and misuse design patterns in general
lush could be wonderful but it not used it for an actual application several months ago it is almost completely undocumented was very sad when found this out it really has lot of potential

when you work at home it important to set boundaries for other people and creatures you should probably have door that closes and you definitely need the will to use it agree that others may be more likely to make demands on the home worker time but it up to the home worker to train them the examples in the article are lame because it seems like the home workers haven done this what with the guy driving his neighbour to the airport he should ask her for her work number on random day the next week he should phone her at work and ask her to pick him up some groceries click understanding
another great hack for getting around the magnetic force field and this is one of those tricking yourself hacks is to tell yourself ok going to work on this for minutes can do anything for minutes gather what you need set timer for minutes and begin chances are when the timer goes off you ll have overcome the force field engaged with the project and be ready to keep working if not schedule another minute session for later another way of breaking down the task

wouldn better name for the article have been programmers considered stupid instead then have no idea what kind of people he trying to attract to work for amazon perhaps it dumb programmers who acknowledge that they re dumb and don use powerful tools because of it and singleton are elegant and powerful when used well anyone worth hiring will rightly get pissed off by this essay
wow there lot of cool stuff linked from that page heavy on the css though
it common sense dickhead also do you see any rules anywhere does that mean there are none
perhaps you should read the article or take logic class there is no explanation there the statement gt russians on the other hand do everything to stay sober while drinking as much alcohol as possible then it goes on to say how they do it my question stands
there are alcoholic drinks that are good tasting there are certain wines that drink more of if they had alcohol
everything written in this article is true and then some note that it mostly applies to those with wives and children the key to effectively working at home seems to be combination of two things highly disciplined worker and an isolated usable work area think the latter is the most important and even applies to the office if you can work for sensible periods of time without interruptions your effectiveness drops to nil

the reason the music industry is loosing money is because they focus to much on disposable music they find the front men or women to sing get some music made by people who know only how to make music that is the sound of the moment everyone knows their role band member just do what their told to then this shit gets heavily marketed and people buy it but buying audience is small and this stuff only gets brought while it is in fashion compare that to music that gets to where it is through talent and passion when hear marketed band singer singing about say loss it just can reach me because it not true and is sung without meaning compared that to real band where it the singers real experience music like this can continue to sell for decades and by all generations if the music industry want there sales to go up they should go to the clubs and do talent spotting like they used to and not by people who think what will sell but who think what sounds good and more to the point what feels good

yep it prostitution victimless crime if ever there was one jesus was able to forgive them you should too yes it touching story because of his disabilities and yes if it was about somebody with other problems it would probably be just as touching and not just in the literal sense btw if you don want to hear those intimate details then why did you click the link perhaps the next story will be about your experience with prostitute and how it opened your eyes and your heart look forward to it

think that people who work at home have more control over their environment like higgsboson says you need to train the people sharing the same house as you have you tried doing that to your boss or co workers at work it won work unless you can fire them still would rather be interrupted by my child than my boss coming in every minutes to share his next idiot idea you can also control the noise level around you at the office share the floor with loud people and ringing phones much rather be at home listening to my stereo another thing would like yes don work from home yet is the ability to manage my own time if have something important to do no problem work hours as long as get paid to do so but if can do anything because waiting for others rather be able to go and do my laundry than sit around twiddling thumbs while others take smoke breaks and waste away time

with all the discussion on lisp and the parallel to java say introduce them both in the same application here is an application on using abcl and the standard java libraries could also suggest using jython
thought this article was complete rubbish didn get the feeling the guy knows the first thing about programming and he only provided extremely vague refutations of what paul graham had to say nothing concrete nothing specific the main point the author focuses on is the superficial differences between painting and programming one of them is manipulating electronic bits and the other is putting oil on canvas with stick and animal hair from that he concludes the two things are totally and utterly different from each other clearly this guy is not real programmer or probably even good programmer for that matter am sure that many or even most programmers are not artists but that isn who paul graham writes about he writes about the great programmers the ones who write code that reads like poetry or unfolds like great art there are also plenty of programmers who can make you cry just by looking at their code but that different kind of programmer entirely personally thought this article was stupid and filled with the kind of nonsence that he accused paul graham of perpetrating he complains that paul graham eric raymond and dave winer write about things they see in themselves and call that greatness apparently this author writes about the shortcomings and failures he projects from himself onto other people moron
guess that you missed his main points true java kids can do all kinds of things however learning pointers and recursion makes one better much better programmer without looking into pointer and lisp recursion java only kids do not know what they have missed that the point it pitty that many people don get it
an amusingly ironic response when the aclu stands up for something you disagree with they re showing their true colors but when they stand up for something you agree with those are just cleverly designed pr events to further the conspiracy but the one being gullible
you know what could sit here and argue with you but it would be bad investment of my time here what going to do instead going to remind you that every word in that article was typed using freaking mouthstick by man who cannot move anything below his neck so who the fuck cares if he paid money for sex moreover you do see things in black and white and just because you say you don doesn mean it true it all talk no walk the only argument you have against prostitution is stds which obviously doesn apply in this case thus you have no logical argument against prostitution in this case thus your objection stems from black and white binary low level thinking and thus in conclusion therefore ergo accordingly are wanker_ good day
you really should it lot of fun
oh right like the time he raised man who had been dead for days come on you may have your theories but this article tries to say jesus as almost certainly cannabis user and an early proponent of the medicinal properties of the drug according to study of scriptural texts published this month if you actually studied the scriptural texts have no clue how you come up with these theories even if you look at it from secular point of view again don care how much your drench dead body with cannabis it sure as hell ain coming back to life either the stories are made up or they are real an explanation like cannabis really doesn cut it as matter of fact the only reference of annointing oils in the new testament was when prostitute put them on christ feet many of the instances of healing in the nt were spontaneous and mention nothing about any oils for example woman who has menstrual problem touches christ and is healed christ turns around and asks who touched him because felt power go out from me there is no mention that christ turned around and put oils on the woman she was the one who touched him imagine this will get promoted purely due to how much people like to read controversial stuff no matter how far it is from the truth wish the scholars involved in this study did better job of reading the texts

it seems that mr goings has spent the last years of his life at eating donuts and staring at table settings at his local greasy spoon the pictures give me feeling of bleak loneliness besides if you re going to spend years copying photographs with paintbrush couldn you at least learn to take better photographs
the author paintings are very beautiful paul graham lisp books are great but just because artists and scientists create things does not mean that art is like science which is the author point good programmers are computer scientists so would argue that programming is or most likely should be science emotions are to art what logic is to science emotions and logic contradict big time what have written here has nothing to do with art because it is all logical
joel spolsky bores me pleased to find that someone else agrees find his stuff crap lot of the time and frankly his company and software isn that great
no because he not saying programmers are stupid or even that programmers that use the singleton are stupid he saying that there are substantial number of programmers who think they know good object oriented design practice just because they know what the singleton pattern is even though they often don understand when it should be used and more importantly when it should not be used completely agree that the singleton pattern is elegant and powerful when used well but the cases where it is used well are rare in comparison to the number of people who use it blindly without really understanding the underlying concepts
well personally would like feature on reddit where if joel spolsky is mentioned in any article that just don see it the guy bores me so so much
got the impression that painting is nothing like hacking because one gets you laid and the other doesn now let hear it from paul graham are you just gonna sit there and take that
get the feeling that lot of people who diss js have never seen the field from the side of hiring people with tight budgets aka the real world as an employer you have significant challenges in getting the people you want especially if you re small company big companies can get whoever they want by simple virtue of the law of big numbers when you can afford to make mistake upon hiring you want to be able to find that ideal candidate for startup which is where js experience derives what you re working on is probably so far left field that whatever practical experience your candidate has they re going to need to learn crap load at your place before they re useful for that particular situation the thing you want above all else is the ability to learn which good working knowledge of things like pointers and cs theory is good indicator of again this is all predicated on small firm doing something unusual
it is said that good mathematician sees analogies between things great mathematician sees analogies between analogies there is something creative and imaginative which is the mark of all that is great in their trade the guy point of view of painting is so low that he concludes that picasso was worrying about the same things as he is
like the point about assembly language just one example
education in hard concepts is not as important as education in relevant concepts
argh killed my last comment accidentally as practicing engineer find the knowledge gained when used log tables in high school of great importance use approximations based on logs very often in my work do they teach the use of log tables anymore if not then should complain about the calculator kids who can understand it when say the signal is db lower or don understand the concept of the log amp
drinking has way of catching up to you suppose
it is possible that the thrust of paul graham argument was not that hackers are like painters in any literal sense but that it is inaccurate to look at programmers as engineers in the blueprints and slide rule sense painting is merely handy analogy the fact that graham is interested in painting not entirely untalented as well and knows something of its history maybe not everything certainly gives him enough authority to say hey these things are not so different have no problem believing that there is overlap between paul graham painting mode and paul graham hacking mode and am glad for the insights he offers regarding the creative process in general it can be bit annoying when people from the hard sciences start talking about the art of their practice in my experience this usually results from confusion between beauty elegance and art at large the last years have served as pretty strong argument that beauty art and its no wonder that some people would find it difficult to consider merge sort or even viaweb in the same light as guernica however by the same token artists have habit of intentionally mysticizing their work judging from the superficial beauty and elegance of the author work would say his process all bohemian orgies aside has lot more in common with engineering than he would like to admit
and by talent you mean extraordinary amounts of free time they sure there is somethign fascinating about photorealism but is there really nothing better to spend your time on
this guy is whining because no one reads his blog boo hoo ll try to help that trend continue
great blog article funny and true
or you could just disable autorun permanently or just not buy copy protected cds at all which is probably much better
we re programmers programmers are in their hearts architects joel spolsky think this is much more matching analogy being programming creative activity of course some analogy exists with painters too but there is deep difference as architects have to be creative under lot of constraints from the gravity force to space this is also true for programmers but think it not the same for painters unless they choose to paint in very specific way sometimes it said that the real creative moment of an architect is not while he is designing something but when he builds his own architectural system to design something is then the application of such system still creative activity but not the most important part it seems like that it true for programming too you are creative when you try to solve given specific problem with the tools you have but your best effort is when you try to build these tools in generic way in your head when you find new systems to describe problems as this appears to be to me at least not as true as it is for programming and architecture if applied to painting this is somewhat not very objective maybe proof that painting and programming isn the best match for an analogy

think the point was not java vs lisp or something like it it was about how its difficult to test someone cs concepts using java for example whole array of complex and tricky style string manipulation stuff like strncmp and strcpy cant be asked to someone who thinks java lang utils string are only way to manipulate strings
guess there would be some photograph on the page if any of it was real but seeing only drawings think it just funny speculation about what be done
yeah losing money think the internet will be very important in rectifying the annoying music situation this is because the internet allows everyone to be involved it removes barriers to finding new music think it will be more and more embraced by artists resulting in an overall rise in the accessibility of quality music don say that it will raise the quality of music because believe there is already whole lot of high quality stuff out there it just is not being exposed think the trend is already starting it will just gain momentum as more people realize they can cheaply publish to the web more will this results in huge amount of stuff being available the great thing about the internet is that quality things always rise to the top through word of mouth

and are not entirely true afaik reduce the number of local variables to make sure each can have it own register this was the case long time ago but compilers can figure out register dependencies sufficiently that trying to work for this tip is simply going to convolute your code pass anything over bytes by reference this is usually true but keep in mind that each access to variable passed by reference will incur pointer dereference there is tradeoff not hard and fast rule
end of internet predicted film at
study at the delft university of technology the netherlands the whole works is taught here in the cs department lot of java sure but there course on assembler caml and prolog are covered as are the basics of lisp and is used in major computer graphics project with slew of pointers to boot and yet of all students who get their degree here can program worth damn over half is raving lunatic for their own language usually suggesting insert any language here is the only language you ever need to learn and that all other languages by virtue of not being insert any language here suck is obviously clear sign you don get it and the rest run for cover the moment you dare speak the words programming or in short spolsky full of it by empirical proof it not what you teach it how you do it
some of these are misguided to say the least like adjusting structure sizes to powers of two or avoiding local variables besides that they don mention the most common low level optimisation mistakes people do not writing cache friendly code and thinking memory allocation is cheap also any article on optimisation that doesn begin with profile first shouldn be trusted
the best way to optimize any code is to profile profile profile and then think about what the profiling data says try to find better data structure in order to pre calculate whatever can be and to minimize data structure traversals try to memoize variables and expression values to minimize re running code and re evaluating subexpressions then think about algorithms in case you can find more efficient way of doing whatever you re still doing only after that should you consider cache friendliness and memory locality

ve thought about replying to this article it loaded with mistakes but merely refuting something mistaken doesn generally produce an interesting essay so the joke would be on me if spent time on that instead of exploring some genuinely interesting question then instead of merely calling me names this guy would have wasted week of my life
ve also compared programmmers to architects in other essays there are some ways programmers are more like painters though for example programs like paintings are all design whereas buildings are designed by architects and then handed over to builders to build so you see lot more rapid prototyping and refactoring in hacking and painting than architecture an architect has much less ability to change things once construction starts

when first came to america found the whole doggy bag culture very unseemly and would never have dared asking to take the left over scraps home now after living combined years in canada and america would snub my nose at the blatant waste of not taking doggy bag am not sure if this can be attributed to change in culture age or the fact that portions here are so much larger than in europe suspect it has to do with all three with heavy slant on the latter

am on the watch list too or rather the name paul graham is that cause you re dangerous subversive we ve all been warned about people like you paul the most unusual case ever heard of is the case of the name dave nelson being mysteriously red flagged in the now defunct capps ii data mining system afaik nobody ever figured out why that was and even the developers of the system didn know or at least didn admit to knowing what found eerie about it was that dave and nelson as in rockefeller were the nicknames for the wtc twin towers

that exactly what the article addresses though most of the comments here are just re iterating what js says as if they hadn read or understood this article which points out the logical fallacy that joel has fallen into it says that while joel is accusing the java kids of being blub programmers joel himself is blub programmer when looked at from different perspective it variation on the paul graham argument as it is saying that you can move the apex of the programming power scale dependent on the requirements and environment of the day like joel essays and no java fan but do find his emphasis on stuff like pointers bit strange for company developing web apps surely high level approach with emphasis on architecture and rad are more important it why we are seeing the rise of frameworks like rails

agree with the article pointers and recursion seem to be randomly picked there are much harder programming concepts like coroutines and continuations and they are useful in the real world for certain tasks but you can see that if you don already understand the concepts think the problem with teaching them is the limited real world examples that are usually demonstrated think event driven programming versus the old console style ui is good showcase for coroutines and continuations can be demonstrated building on coroutines in the context of web development has anybody written this tutorial

well sorry but for me cs courses are about making the programmer life easy and not about making the life of the recruiter easy if can tell bright person from not so bright one that means just crap at hiring it does not mean universities are crap at teaching moreover in his essay js keeps complaining about crappy recruiters who use grep to evaluate rã sumã and hire crappy programmers as result this one really bothers me for two reasons if hiring crappy programmers is as simple as using grep then why doesn joel just use grep himself to sort them out hiring brilliant programmers must be hard orelse everyone will be able to hire them and joel will lose his competitive advantage really think joel is becoming bit crotchety as he himself admits remember how back in the everyone complained about how the universities treat cs as abstract science and do not teach you jack about actual programming working for real company in the real world now as universities start teaching people the stuff they ll most probably need to actually pay they bills now that they start or continue teaching programming languages that are actually used in the industry now those very same people start telling us how much better the old days were mon face it the need for scheme applications is not exactly rising sure get your point learning scheme or lisp or sml will make you better programmer in any language including java but that like saying that studying physics will make you better driver it surely will but most pizza delivering companies simply don require their drivers to hold ph in physics so why waste your time studying physics if you could get the job anyway tellya what understanding the theory of relativity will make you an even better programmer but does that mean that anyone who doesn understand the theory of relativity is crappy programmer sigh my biggest problem with joel however is his whining about gt cs graduates who are simply not smart enough to work gt as programmers on anything more sophisticated than gt yet another java accounting application sorry joel but such arrogance makes me sick last time checked you were working on nothing more sophisticated than yet another asp bugtracking application frankly you are not in position to dis anyone yes understand that your bugtracking software is the cat whiskers and you certainly need brilliant people to make it work for left handed avocado farmers with polish keyboards but again writing accounting software that works for left handed avocado farmers with polish keyboards is just as hard and requires just as brilliant programmers and again if hiring brilliant people becomes easy then you ll have to compete against those grep using recruiters that will make your life worse not better

for all those repressed idiots whos comments seem to have kindly been deleted here are two points you think prostitution is evil per se if this is religious notion here is little fact judah of the bible hired what he thought was prostitute he is according to the same bible the projenitor of the kings of israel prostitution is forbidden by jewish law but is permitted to non jews even the jewish forefathers are treated as non jews before moses delivered the goods you having sex with disabled person is degrading to woman and is only done for money fwy bertrand russell mother had mercy sex with disabled person with his father consent do not think it was done for money
so good information
minus the added commentary anyone believing in god should follow these as well and as for this comment the ten commandments have been with us for more than two millennia yet murder cruelty thievery racism ethnic hatred and religious strife is just as much if not more part of our everyday lives as it ever was no matter what we replace them with we will always find more of the same because we are human
that pretty much the idea of athiesm isn it we as human beings must acknowledge and accept the flaws of human nature and should be responsible for our own actions regardless of the religious culture with which we are presented

more than defense this article needs reality check no one know here in northern italy gets that much vacation my wife parents both work in state jobs and certainly get lot of vacation probably month all things considered but not the month and half that these statistics suggest and then we come to the other reality not many people my age have the sorts of jobs that let you get even that month of vacation at most you might get month of unpaid leave in august when everything shuts down this is the flip side of italy social model it very hard to fire people once they are entrenched with full fledged contracts so employers do what they can to avoid hiring people that way the result being is that you get some sort of half baked position that neither here nor there often without some of the benefits like the month of vacation something else that interesting that these stats dont really show is that large portion of italy takes their vacations in the same month august when much of northern italy shuts down view that as being more harmful to productivity than long vacations because even those who want to work can and don relish the idea of giving up crowded busy cities to go to crowded busy pricey beach towns myself
love feynman stories he such character
the brazilian one is quite correct if you re properly registrated employee you have days of paid vacations per year surprised about how short are the us vacations

gt simply refuse to allow my personal morality to be predicated on the promise of heaven or the threat of hell thats how you prode animals not humans that shows pretty major of chritianity my personal morality has nothing to do with the promise or heaven or the threat of hell it has to do with obeying living god which is much wiser than myself and has never let me down ve yet to see command of christ that doesn make sense it is through my own personal experience that not following the law has only led to hardship for me it seems to me that many of the commands of the bible are good for living better life glad he had the sense to command me to love my neighbor as myself because that in itself sums up any command you could ever make also wasn aware that animals were prodded with promises of heaven and threats of hell mean when tell my dog to do something and he won listen don say if you don do this you are going to doggie hell infact don know anyone that does that that kind of weird gt religion as nonsensical as christianity and please be bit more tactful with your words understand why some people are atheists but to say that christianity is nonsensical because of some misgivings you may have is pretty hard headed will agree some christians live very nonsensical brand of christianity but not all do the the general assumption that being christian means that your brain is somehow disabled irks me quite bit

there is no doubt that person can be good or evil and anything in between regardless of creed or lack thereof the goal of the athiest is simply to question the basic foundations of religion clearly the bible and its various interpretations are full of inconsistencies and it makes no sense to base further assumptions on source which cannot withstand rigorous analysis in the first place if historical context cannot be trusted in determining truth it must be that religious belief comes from faith alone and if it is faith that gives us this strong attachment what prevents us from simply choosing different religion or different set of beliefs to the athiest this is exactly the relevation since we are free to believe in whatever we choose why not believe in ourselves
one of the point of js article imho is that univertsities seem more interested in giving students the knowledge requested from software companies than teaching the basics like pointers and recursion in italy we recently had reform in universities that goes exactly in this direction create graduates quickly and with the knowledge requested by the market these seems to be the only judgement methods for good university having strong basics let programmer adapt and learn new things easily and in programming where things change so quickly find it invaluable

gt clearly the bible and its various interpretations are full of inconsistencies and it makes no sense to base further assumptions on source which cannot withstand rigorous analysis in the first place actually the only reason christian is because did some serious study on christianity refused to have blind faith christ said to love god with all your mind heart and body obviously that implies more than just blind emotional faith that being said ve yet to find anyone who can find true inconstency with the bible every inconsistentcy or contradiction ve ever seen brought forth against the bible is either not reading the text in context or not understanding the audience it was written to love it if you would show me one gt if historical context cannot be trusted in determining truth it must be that religious belief comes from faith alone and the bible has shown time and time again that it is an accurate historical record an example sir william ramsay was respected archaelogist who lived at the end of the th century he was an atheist who ascribed to the theory that the book of acts was product of made up stories produced in the rd century using the bible as source text he set out around the mediterranean intend on disproving it in the process of trying to show that the biblical stories were made up he found that the bible was remarkably accurate historical text he suprised everyone when he returned home and wrote his book st paul the traveller and roman citizen in which he stated great historians are the rarest of writers regard luke among the historians of the first rank gt since we are free to believe in whatever we choose why not believe in ourselves did hitler not believe in himself did jeffrey dahmer not believe in himself if we have no ultimate authority on what is right or wrong what business do you have telling the murderer that he is doing wrong perhaps he is only doing what he believes right see hitler think there is bit of on what exactly faith is faith doesn necessarily imply one without evidence you place faith trust in your friends or certain people because they have shown you that they are reliable faith is placed on court decisions not because there is absolute proof that something has happened but rather because the evidence is too great to ignore the same goes for the christian you don have to put blinders on to believe in god infact god wants you to seek him out and look for the evidence that he is there it is the only reason am christian have seen historically and in my own life time and time again evidences of god just like many of you were not born atheists or raised as an atheist was not born christian

well to begin with the translation they are using is the king james version which is not very accurate the kjv was based off of manuscripts from the th century ad and later where as modern translations come from texts dating as far back as the rd and th centuries understanding of ancient biblical hebrew and greek has also obviously increased since when the kjv was written as well for example one of the verses they cite deuteronomy in the kjv reads that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth which the lord thy god giveth thee for ever where as in the niv it reads keep his decrees and commands which am giving you today so that it may go well with you and your children after you and that you may live long in the land the lord your god gives you for all time now obviously these people aren going to live forever and thus be able to live in the land forever but it is symbolic representation of god covenant with israel deuteronomy is not referring to the earth as planet but rather as the land the israelites knew this rendering also fits in the context of the verse where moses is speaking to the israelites about their future in the land of canaan anyway their first example is an excellent example of not looking at the verses in context with the rest of the bible yes the current earth will be destroyed but verses such as isaiah speak of new heavens and new earth actually they reference this one so while the current version of the earth will not always be around earth itself will and that what the verses provided are getting at another example they provide which is is dancing sin is great example of taking the verses out of context for example they reference exodus which says and it came to pass as soon as he came nigh unto the camp that he saw the calf and the dancing and moses anger waxed hot and moses said unto aaron what did this people unto thee that thou hast brought so great sin upon them they actually italicize dancing as if it is the sin of the israelites but in the context of the entire passage that is obviously not the case the act of dancing wasn sinful it was the act of worshipping the golden calf which was sinful actually very suprised they even tried to call this an inconsistency because its really stretching it to call it one the same goes with the other verses they referenced to try and show that the bible says dancing is sin could keep going with these examples but think have provided enough to show some of the major problems with these so called inconsistencies one thing that should be known about ecclesiastes is it by nature is very contradictory book solomon the author praises different actions and desires and in the very next sentence will speak of how worthless they are basically alluding to the fact on how great things are at first but how they quickly lose their luster that why by the end of the book you see him make succinct summary now all has been heard here is the conclusion of the matter fear god and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man but again most of these alleged contradictions would not even be pointed out if critics would take the time to read many of the passages in context instead of isolating sentences and trying to make them read what they aren mean the bible actually says there is no god but if you read the entire verse in context it reads the fool says there is no god obviously you can see the problem with chosing one verse out of collection of books and trying to interpret the verse just by itself

don understand what exactly is this court case about does anyone know gt signor cascioli maintains that early christian writers confused jesus with john of gamala an anti roman jewish insurgent in st century palestine right because its common for thousands of people to just completely get people confused why exactly would even the jewish rabbis mention christ albeit negatively in the talmud if he didn exist that in itself should be the first proof that whatever claims are being made is bunk as there are several extra biblical sources that mention christ the talmud being only one of them its debatable as to whether christ really was who he said he was but to go as far as to say that not only he didn exist but the gospel accounts are based off of completely misidentifying person is ludicrous

gt did hitler not believe in himself did jeffrey dahmer not believe in himself if we have no ultimate authority on what is right or wrong what business do you have telling the murderer that he is doing wrong perhaps he is only doing what he believes right see hitler not christian but what business do you have telling the murderer that what he is doing is wrong thought god was the judge guess you as christian know better are obviously better person then me and hitler because believe in myself can not hold moral code right that seems to be your arguement you are so wrapped up in defending your faith you forget that faith is an individual thing have you ever heard the saying the road to hell is paved with good intentions most people who are evil do them because they think they are doing right athiest see hitler or not see crusades slavery isreal pakistan in the end its not the religion that is important it is the people
when you are sailing and just starting to get little speed there is wide angle around where the wind is coming called the no go zone simply because if you face it you will go nowhere fast after you pick up speed that angle shrinks because your momentum nullifies fringe effects of the wind acting upon you so you can tighten up your angle and face little more into the wind but never completely into it so his analogy is that the wind is the big problem and the more you get to work on the problem the more velocity you pick up the more directly you can face it even if you never can face it directly
it is easier here just to mark up down the comments you agree disagree with but yes believe that people should comment more rather than rate when possible we have more interesting discussion here sometimes though it better just to mark the remarks about bush lisp and paul graham down that you don agree with and move along as for the comments on this particular story don agree with most of them honestly think this guy paintings are fantastic could never paint like that also get the sense there this feeling that he been wasting his time somehow huh
he didn make negative remarks something that anyone can do he took part in that much more exclusive activity denouncing which is available only to the rabidly fanatical
this is news it was on digg months ago
well it on reddit now
this would explain the robe sandals and long hair
indead
denouncing really can refer to an entire range of things wonder where you get the idea that its only available to the radibly fanatical denouncing could be anything from his works are incorrect to he burning in hell mean really it could go from one extreme to another quick look up on the literal definition not that it really matters to condemn openly as being evil or reprehensible see synonyms at criticize to accuse formally to give formal announcement of the ending of treaty robbie aren you comdemning openly those who are rabidly fanatical should we take you to court for that oddly enough in doing the same thing you are condemning are you now radidly fanatical person also do not literally mean what just said but your snap judgement on the situation when the article isn very specific is little off the whole trial seems more than little bizarre priest denounces this could mean myriad of things man who is denouncing the person of jesus christ so now the man takes the priest to court and is sueing him and on top of that the judge wants the priest to prove jesus christ exists like said the whole thing sounds ridiculous and bizarre and for the record not roman catholic if anyone feels like trying to use that against me
always found we should just apply the laws of robotics to humanity and live by that
gt not christian but what business do you have telling the murderer that what he is doing is wrong thought god was the judge really not sure what you are trying to say yes believe god is the judge gt guess you as christian know better are obviously better person then me and hitler why the snide remarks where did even imply that in anything ve written gt because believe in myself can not hold moral code right that seems to be your arguement you are so wrapped up in defending your faith you forget that faith is an individual thing first of all what exactly does believing in yourself mean and again if faith is an individual thing then we have no right to condemn murderers rapists racists really anything we condemn today if its all personal thing who is to say what is right and wrong gt have you ever heard the saying the road to hell is paved with good intentions most people who are evil do them because they think they are doing right athiest see hitler or not see crusades slavery isreal pakistan in the end its not the religion that is important it is the people yeah that pretty much what was saying

disagree their debt load is certainly high for manufacturing company but not so bad considering that it is as you noted more of financial company which is understandable since financing is where again like you said so don quite understand why you want them to focus on making cars which you note that they re bad at instead of loans which you admit that they re good at and finally your analogy is flawed the dow is not supposed to represent all companies from when they re added ad infinitum it adjusts based on changing circumstances and be that america transition from manufacturing to an information financial economy is quite transition look at the original dow there only one company from that list that still in the dow and it ge perfect exemplar of the manufacturing to banking transformation

this article strikes me as being so painfully wrong right pointers are hard but guess what memory management isn programming punching holes in cards isn programming the article is essentially saying that we need to separate the men from the boys by having them concentrate on irrelevant details fair enough if that makes sense to you but please don pretend these details have anything to do with the process of writing computer programs in my modest experience the opposite is true have someone spend decade managing memory and counting bits then put them in an environment when they don have any such distractions when function that adds and reads let add and they will reliably produce bullshit because they have forgotten how to actually write programs having spent so much time worring about whatever irrelevancies were imposed on them by their language of choice might be good choice to teach for other reasons like it provokes understanding of efficiency or machine architecture which are valuable insights but not because it is worthwhile to concentrate on because it is more difficult junk junk junk

gmcg chrichton has an md from harvard medical school which in my book qualifies at least as scientific background it seemed to me that all of his examples were footnoted so not really sure why you say he was uninformed
it is pretty common for people to believe stupid things mutually inconsistent things and impossible things so don see priori why getting the identity of some guy who lived thousand years ago wrong is all that much of stretch particularly given that the single source that tells us the most about him is as understand it mishmash of nth generation translations of oral histories with some things thrown in that require rather nonstandard understanding of several branches of science that said the case really is pretty wierd here is somewhat coherent translation from italian of filing by luigi cascioli it from site that bears his name so grain of salt may be in order http www luigicascioli it processo_eng php and here is purported translation of luigi initial letter of complaint http www christianism com html notes note html it seems that the article really does explain about all there is to the case righi says that jesus existed cascioli thinks not and sued him under something that sounds like an anti propaganda law maybe it is something left over from wwii believe that germany has some laws that forbid certain forms of expression as propaganda or something perhaps that is where this law comes from as side note calling christ divinity debatable is bit of stretch it is demonstrably believable for at least some people but it is not really something on which there can be much of any true debate
rather extensive treatment on this phenomenon can be found in freakonomics by the way

this speech mostly deals with society capacity for acting based on fear rather than information we should take crichton message as warning and nothing more no matter the issue the questions remain the same what do we know what can we do with what we know hopefully crichton writings provoke people to ask these questions about global warming despite his polemics sure that even he would be pleased if people took it upon themselves to learn about the science behind the headlines
when criticize the chrichton essay as uninformed do not mean that think that the author is stupid or short graduate degree do mean that the structure of his argument is such that it appears to refute and or falsify theories related to global warming while cleverly refusing to provide any information at all absurd generalizatoins approaching an undeclared general theory of warnings are pointed to for evidence that climate change warnings are baseless for example one interesting feature is the tendency to reversals benefit becomes hazard and then becomes benefit again butter is good then bad then good again saccharine is good then bad then good why not generalize from our experiences with asbestos and lead to reach the opposite conclusion there is no meat to the argument where is the counter evidence it sounds like it coming kept waiting for it but the closest we get is news that the saccharine hullabaloo came to nothing no new evidence and silly invalid form of argument that is what mean by uninformed
cascioli says that there are not other records of christ other than the biblical account very easy proof of that being false is that christ is mentioned in the talmud the fact that christ was mentioned in other nonbiblical sources really is not debatable the bible has shown time and time again to be an accurate account of history people debated that the hittites ever existed they were mentioned in the bible lo and behold their civilization was discovered around the end of the th century people debated if pilate ever existed cornerstone that says potius pilate procurator of the jews has been found in ancient caeseara phillippi as stated in another post sir william ramsay was an atheist who set out using the book of acts as his guidebook at disprove it and show that it was product of rd century myths he began excavating in the mediterranean and suprised everyone when he came back and made the comment in his book consider luke historian of the first rank if christ did not exist the jewish rabbis they had more reason that anyone to say that he didn exist would not have mentioned them in the talmud instead of denying that he existed they attribute his actions to being bastard child being sorceror etc josephus mentions christ altough the lengths to which he does are albeit debatable tacitus roman historian mentions christ by ad nero was already blaming things on new religious group the christians which implies that the religion necessarily began earlier john and other writers claimed to be first hand witnesses of christ and then went out and preached this gospel for absolutely no gain and were stoned crucified and mocked for this gospel if you know for fact that something is lie how often is it that man is willing to die for that lie could mention many evidences but the simple truth is if christ did not exist tall the jewish rabbis who again would love to deny that he existed anyway would not have bothered writing about him in the talmud why would you make negative statements about man who never existed so again if christ was indeed just misidentified person then not only did the christians do the misidentifying but the leading jewish religious leaders did as well and can assure you the jews would not be confusing their heretics and john of gamala quick google on his name reveals bunch of fiction books with him as leader character there are no scholarly sources that mention him if anything it would seem that he was the one who did not exist something else wanted to add for the disciples to completely fabricate the story of jesus makes absolutely no sense at all they added detailst that would have severly restricted the popularity of the religion for example the gospel accounts attribute divinity to jesus man this was completely contrary to the jewish idea of god as an invisible all powerful force infact the jews were so opposed to setting limits to god that they wouldn even write his name for the disciples to fabricate the story of christ as actually being god would have been pretty much suicidal way to start their religion in the eyes of the jews in addition christ would not have been popular god in the eyes of the romans who did not have positive view of the jews and who had powerful gods such as jupiter this story of jewish god dying on the cross embarassing himself by being naked and defecating on himself would not have been attractive to any romans and something that would not have been attractive to either roman or jew was the account by each gospel that the first person to reach christ grave and to discover he was missing was woman this would be seen as making woman witness ie highly accountable and was not something that happened in either society there are many more examples of things like these but in short christianity is the exact opposite of the type of religion you just make up there are so many unnecessary and seemingly negative details in the gospel accounts that its just laughable to suppose that the man of jesus was myth it spread in spite of itself not because of itself again you can debate the divinity of christ all day but to act like he didn even exist is just ludicrous
happened to find what the case is about from cascioli own site according to article of the italian penal code there is an abuse of popular credulity when someone by means of fraud deceives great number of people in this particular case the ministers of religion of the catholic church like righi in the present case by committing historical falsity therefore presenting invented facts as if true and actually occurred but useful to religious doctrine they deceive all the people that come into contact with the teachings of such religion by inducing them to believe in that religion not on the basis of purely theological reasoning totally legitimate and admissible but on the basis of deceptive representation of the facts was thinking it would be interesting if cascioli had to prove that john of gamala existed as well because otherwise isn he doing the same thing he is sueing someone for if john of gamala did not exist

am in quality and productivity in my area of concern is not considered by others as choice but must have no choice but to muster the energy from somewhere to meet those demands but like everyone else allso procrastinate have developed over period of time habit so to speak whereby have allready measured my capability of meeting the before date of the deadline whether it is my own or for the company that work for in other words allow myself to procrastinate for period of time before the whistle blows this can be measured in days to weeks however this is probably my downfall in terms of productivity because there should be balance simplistic example if you eat to much you get sick as with drinking as my companion allways says too much of anything is not good however love to procrastinate do alot of creative thinking in this area actually at the end of the day don think that anyone in work for money senario has any choice but to be productive money is what make the world tick on more serious note comment that read stated that one must tackle problem by identifying and breaking up the area of concern so as to be able to understand it better and therefore to enable positive productivity this is definitely good approach the above and all the other suggestions are great ideas but who feels like doing them this is too much for one day think ll go and watch some tv

great article am very interested in search and have also been watching the social networking aspect of many sites including this one pleased that yahoo has woken up to it as competition for google can only help all of us
think there is much deeper and possibly darker reason for choosing postgressql that hasn been disclosed as yet indeed think that web py is cunning attempt to capture all python programmers into his evil clutches before pushing them all to programming in lisp once he has their minds obviously just my own thoughts here

have you read the mentions of jesus in the talmud large grain of salt is needed to assume that any of them refer to the biblical jeses it seems to me that the religion invented jesus not the other way around
were you planning it or were you just lucky
first off they are using the words incorrectly they are not actually talking about file system but rather directory structure the directory structure is really naming convention that has particular purpose to uniquely identify files any system that does not have at least an implicit directory structure will have data loss because two different files that are the same in the namespace will not be distinguishable
wow what numbskull
it is not evil
my version http www dot com weblog archives
again the jesus that was invented assuming he was would have been the most illogical thing created he would not be appealing to the romans or the jews and the idea that the religion invented jesus goes against the culture of the societies in which christianity spread at the time the truth is most of you probably don doubt that buddha or muhammad existed but when it comes to christ it all of sudden becomes very debatable issue the website you have provided offers very little evidence to what you are claiming sure it offers the words of scholars but could list just as many scholars to you that believe that christ did exist something that should make you question how valid that site is is very few of the men listed are historians people such as voltaire are listed who had an absolute rabid hatred of christianity voltaire was so hypocritical as to condemn christians for crimes they committed against others and rightly so and then rejoiced when churches were destroyed and christians were murdered during the french revolution yeah your site lists people like ralph waldo emerson but as great of writer he was he is certainly not someone you go to for historical matters there are very few real historians that doubt that christ existed if they doubt anything it is whether or not he was divine

neither of those sites say how they actually collect said data which seems to be the hardest part of such survey frankly simply because how they collect the data is not well displayed on either page makes me doubt how useful it is

patent absurdity isn that almost redundant today patent alone automatically implies absurd
we need only look at scientology in the last few decennia to see how absurd and illogical religions can flourish most scholars writing about jesus have been religious themselves and many non religious historians would rather avoid the issue for fear of threading on religious toes the webpage offered provides little evidence because the author is reviewing some of the writers who have written about the myth of jesus over the past years don think his goal with that webpage was to convert believers into skeptics

it an interesting article but like many of the people who have commented here disagree with much of what he says two things stand out in particular first don think most people live in fear think most people live in cocoon of blissful ignorance perpetuated by media government and experts who always try to make it sound like everything is in control and that there isn much to worry about they sound like crichton in this lecture second disagree with his of complex systems that can only be managed not controlled this is the rationale we always get for why globalism for example is unstoppable it complex system so we need to manage it because we can control it in other words we can control our own destiny because it too complicated we need to sit back and manage things not try to change things according to crichton

from the faq one thing to keep in mind is that retrievr doesn do object face text recognition of any kind so if you re drawing an outline sketch of chair it almost certainly won get you one back except your index only contains images of chairs the same holds for corporate logos icons amp it helps to think of it as matching the most pronounced shapes and slabs of colors why do you think they don give you finer pen the most compelling results for me have been when just used two or three colours with extremely simple arrangements ie blue background with red blob in bottom left corner can wait for them to add more images

but there is monumental difference between driving and driving after drinking think cars are insanely dangerous anyway they should all be made of plastic and go no more than miles an hour thats plenty to take the kids to school and pick up the shopping and once people can do long distance journeys in their cars public transport will take up the slack get cheaper more effecient more regular and pleasanter the problem is people feel there is an inalienable human right to operate extremely dangerous machinery in the name of convenience and will fight tooth and nail to protect it

michael crichton should shut his mouth and stick to writing bad books what really struck me about his lecture is the similarity between many of the examples he gives and what he is doing himself playing off of uninformed hype to enrich empower oneself despite the footnotes he is either uninformed or liar his whole idea of complex and linear systems is incorrect two examples he gives of linear systems rocket and cannonball are in fact non linear linear systems are proportional if the input is changed the output changes by proportional ammount and additive the output in response to the sum of two inputs is exactly the sum of the outputs in response to the inputs individually ojects moving in gravitational field do not meet these requirements even if you ignore friction dip into high school physics pull out the basic equations for kinetic and potential energy and consider the relationship between initial velocity and height reached by the cannonball if you can see the non linearity there perhaps you should go buy one of crichton books enough beating dead horse what he is really talking about seems to be non deterministic systems which aren as unpredictable as he wants if it weren possible to predict to some degree of accuracy the behavior of non deterministic systems we could achieve nothing he seems to demand total predictability which is real jack thing to do right along the lines of the creationists id ers he contends that complex systems can only be managed management requires some ability to expect result from cetain action which is prediction so by his argument since complex systems can be predicted and management requires prediction management of complex systems is impossible does he even think this stuff through although to be fair his idea of management and predictions are probably different he also seems to be engaging in some intellectual dishonesty by showing the headline and first few words of the independent future of the earth article and implying that the article is an example of people playing on fear from the way it starts wager that the article is actually along the lines of his argument not an actual fear mongering piece can verify since the independent wants pound to purchase the article another thing doctors especially md are not scientists automaticaly they are technicians who apply the findings of science some doctors are scientists they do research the rest are like mechanics they try to figure out problem and fix it at gross level not experiment to find explanations for the problem oversimplifying here there is some cross over between general practice medicine and the practice of science the same can be said of mechanics however having an md phd or an ase certification doesn mean you know crap about an unrelated field could go on all night
it has already been demonstrated that terrorist advertising doesn work those who drive drunk will think this will never happen to me anyway

so someone beautiful becoming hideous after car accident is stronger argument then someone dying hmmm
served in an army and it is not obvious to me
has it really can you point me to the study that demonstrates this always thought that advertising of this nature was very effective similar ones relating to smoking have put me off cigarettes
it easy to point out that advertising like this doesn work of the time sure people will see this and still drink and drive but it lot harder to track how many see it and either swear off drinking and driving keep friends from doing so or even just drive drunk less frequently also say it isn so much that becoming hideous is stronger argument than dying as much as it is that the shock value of the message sticks with the viewer more strongly for me have been exposed to death so much in the media that seeing another pretty or average or ugly face who has died barely gets my attention sad to say this on the other hand is the raw reality of what can come of the foolishness that is driving drunk presented in way can ignore

dying happens to everyone before that you ll have some good and some miserable time and the poursuit of happyness stuff is about trying to get more of the former than of the latter killing someone is stopping the show turning her life into permanent physical and psychological intense suffering turning her into impotent being that causes horror to everyone especially her beloved ones without hope for any significant improvement ever is letting it go only for worse know it not pc to say that not every life ought to be lived but would you argue that removing bad times from one life while keeping all of the good ones isn good thing in her case that would have been simple to achieve let her die on that day as she ll probably never any significant good time anymore moreover death being something unavoidable in the long term we came to be more or less used to it and we can sort of cope with the idea quite fortunately we aren used to what happened to her we re still fresh to this kind of horror and we better realize its terrible nature so yes think that what happened to her is far worse than death that it is normal that it causes much more horror than the death of say her carmates and that it is much stronger argument than someone dying
from the page linked to there is link to the pdf of the report the list was gleaned from it states what is the corruption perceptions index the ti corruption perceptions index cpi ranks countries in terms of the degree to which corruption is perceived to exist among public officials and politicians it is composite index drawing on data in expert surveys carried out by variety of reputable institutions it reflects the views of business people and analysts from around the world including experts who are locals in the countries evaluated on the site linked to they already describe in detail how difficult it is to gather information on corruption under question can the costs of corruption be quantified the short answer is no some experts use regression analyses and other empirical methods in order to try to put dollar figure on the cost of corruption it is virtually impossible though since payments of bribes are not publicly recorded no one knows exactly how much money is being invested in corrupt officials annually and bribes do not take only monetary form favours services presents and so on are just as common at most one can research the correlation between the level of corruption and say democratisation economic development or environmental degradation the social costs of corruption are even less quantifiable no one knows how much the loss of an energetic entrepreneur or an acclaimed scientist costs country moreover any estimated social costs in dollars would be inadequate to the task of measuring the human tragedy behind resignation illiteracy or inadequate medical care general scepticism vis vis any attempt at quantifying the costs of corruption is thus warranted the following example illustrates the dilemma of pressing the issue into facts and figures power plant is being built somewhere in the world at cost of us million it could be argued that were it not for corruption the cost could have been as low as us million the financial damage to the public would then be us million in practice quite often projects are planned simply so that those involved can make huge private profits assuming that the power plant was superfluous the financial damage would have to be assessed at us million yet no major construction project leaves the environment untouched the results may be increased pollution lowering of land prices resettlement of local residents an increased debt burden for the country etc this calculation probably closest to reality is immensely complex on global scale it seems almost impossible but even if one were able to calculate the environmental damage the increase of the debt burden and other factors how would one measure the erosion of public confidence and the deterioration of government legitimacy which are the direct result of corruption in my perception you ve taken defensive stance against this data since it triggered your bogometer however the site linked to fully described the potential for bogus data and stresses the difficulty you re concerned about whether the actual list is useful or not it certainly got me to read their site to see how they came up with the data and now find myself understanding corruption bit more that kinda useful to me

we re still animals with survival instinct often so strong that we couldn find the force to terminate ourselves althought there no hope for anything worth it in our future wishing one were dead is one thing finding the mental force to act accordingly to your will and reason rather than obey your instincts is another which is often not bad thing many people will at time or another in their lives wrongly estimate that they re doomed and they re saved by their programmed cowardise toward suicide besides in the case discussed here when you re impotent almost limbless and permanently high with the strongest painkillers medicine can provide there are technical barriers to commiting suicide

don think it is at all affective to those who would be likely to drink amp drive in my younger days anyone knew who would of driven drunk didn think it would happen to me and it didn so their thoughts were reinforced on the other hand when they knew drunk driving police checkstops were on the road it definitely changed behaviour and caused them to be more responsible
wonder how long it will take before will forget this image that poor girl no words can convey the agony she must experience every minute for the rest of her life can anyone imagine the incredible guilt the drunk driver has to live with as result of his one moment of stupidity if had caused such damage to someone else would either have to kill myself or build up some seriously weird psychological defense and go crazy in the process barely qualify as social sipper but yes this would make me fight harder to stop someone else from driving after drinking that poor girl

funny stuff
it not an argument just an example how drunk was the driver in question what were the circumstances of the incident moreover what percentage of accidents are due to alcohol honestly due the current figures are reputedly very loose striking drunk cause one was talking on one cell phone counts as an alcohol related injury or death yes this was truly terrible incident terrible incidents happen all the time arms are removed in threshing machines men die in industrial accidents and so forth the question is what is reasonable and prudent way to reduce the frequency of terrible incidents here in colorado the limit is not imho reasonable or prudent limit sure anyone with bac has too much probably is pretty bad as well but like madd wish to drop it to
no that can be joke

most drunk drivers do not cause any accident executing them would be much larger tragedy than the less frequent damage they cause the title is good evidence of the sense of theatre of the poster or their lack of judgement or both most car accidents do not involve alcohol my understanding is that excessive speed is implicated more often other issues are inattention stereos phones fatigue inexperience poor judgement other drugs etc if this is an argument against drinking and driving then it is an equally strong argument against driving at all people make mistakes with cars those mistakes sometimes have high costs acceptance of cars involves acceptance of risk if the risk of occasionally drinking and driving is unacceptable then risks of driving is too don drink drive do occasionally exceed the posted speed limit not stop completely at stop signs listen to music briefly answer the phone etc it personal choice not moral absolute should not be executed and neither should any other person

think this article headline goes too far sure they want popcorn sales but having bad plot means fewer people returning to the movies fewer recommendations to go to the movies which is not worth it for the small amount of extra popcorn money plus tickets nowadays are between and of that is per person more than you re going to get for popcorn think the writer of this article is just looking to stir up trouble

nice article here where stand yes out of should the national security agency or cia have the ability to monitor domestic phone calls or mails without obtaining judicial approval yes should the government have the ability to hold an american citizen without charge indefinitely without access to lawyer if he is believed to be part of terrorist cell no not indefinitely can you imagine situation in which the government would be justified in waterboarding an american citizen no are there american journalists who should be investigated for possible treason should sedition laws be re introduced no should the cia be able to legally assassinate people in countries with which the is not at war yes should anti terrorism cops be given every single law enforcement tool available in non terrorist cases yes should law enforcement be able to seize the property of suspected though not charged american terrorist and then sell it no should the military be tasked with enforcing domestic crime no should there be national card and should it be made available to law enforcement on demand no should higher percentage of national security related activities and documents be made classified and kept from the eyes of the congress the courts and the public no
definitely one of the most early submissions on reddit
think this is pretty effective even the most cautious of us might be tempted to drive home after say couple of glasses of wine with meal if they don feel an alcohol buzz feeling confident that their reaction times remain unaffected shocking material like this just makes the whole issue seem bit more serious rather than just something which happens to other people sure there will always be people who just don care all that much but for those of us who would like to think of ourselves as reasonable think it will encourage that extra bit of caution

although can see that the dialogue going on here is all over the map on whether the site is effective or not with typical web simplification of the issues to the point of silliness for example what is effective with an year old occasional drinker may not be for year old alcoholic there doesn seem to be as much dialogue about the title it was posted under execute drunk drivers on the spot okay so someone does this once under intense peer pressure at age underage drinker so we kill them on the spot this is knee jerk stupidity lost one of my best friends to repeat drunk driver and never made any comment about her life being taken neither did his parents but lets take this one step farther so what about people who drive dangerously because they have cell phone in one hand coffee in the other and are changing lanes what about people who speed because they are late to miss the school bus what about people who speed to get to doctors appointment far more people are killed by speeders than by drunks far more people are killed because of driver distraction caused by cell phones than by drunks all for heavy ads because do think they will reach subset of the drunk driving population and for stiff penalties how about you kill someone in an accident you lose your license for life but kill the person that just compounds the tragedy even drunk drivers have kids and redeeming features and sorry guess that doesn fit with the posters simplistic vision of humanity and quest for vengeance for something he has probably never personally experienced loss of someone to stupid idiot drunk out of their mind

this google hack is cool not only because it is interesting to see the first picture taken out of the box or after reset but also because lot of those things link to indexes of pictures which the public probably isn meant to see
maybe it possible to write crawler that gets many first shots there is an exif header inside that tells you the date time this is raw guess of the date the camera was purchased in the exif there is also the camera model having this two info you can trace graphs with lines of different color for different camera models and see the commercial success of different cameras release date peaks should be interesting to see but too lazy and busy to try

hmm even after doing this the resulting routines are not reentrant hence not really apppropriate for use in library but then again the standard library shares this characteristic can help but think that this is much easier in language with instance variables or closures don get me wrong big fan of just thinking that if you want to program in you should program in and if you want to escape limitations you re better off using different language rather than jumping through hoops an interesting exercise nonetheless

boy glad don have that job right now not in the habit of defending ubermegacorps but have to say this quote is ridiculous wal mart must not only explain how this could possibly happen but owes all of america especially african americans an apology for what was either racist joke or just incredibly bad judgment said chris kofinis spokesman for wake up wal mart campaign group run by the united food and commercial workers union ok ll admit that anything possible but racist joke are we supposed to believe that group of white supremacist or at least incredibly tasteless and insensitive programmers lurking within wal mart it department deliberately skewed the recommendation system to produce this particular combination say this falls under the category of extraordinary claims and what does bad judgement have to do with it the only judgement at work is that of an automated system working in problem domain that was clearly beyond its abilities besides which they already did explain and did apologize profusely so let save the outrage for where it really belongs please give the guys some credit for recognizing the problem and dealing with it quickly
right now this is rumor wait for the actual announcement before you decide whether this is evil or if it even drm at all
didn the dot com bubble last something like years from to so saying you predicted it but you were just years early means you would ve missed most of the boom had you acted accordingly however do think that housing prices are due for correction can only see two beneficiaries of the current housing boom real estate agents mortage brokers and local governments that base property taxes on percentage of property value so what if my house has gone up in value by in the last four years if sold my house still need someplace to live so either have to buy another house which has also gone up at least by the same percentage meaning that really can capture the gain or have to rent and because housing prices have gone up so have rents landlords need to cover those mortage payments the article claims that rents haven gone up but certainly they have in some areas pricing low income people out of the rental market in areas where rents haven gone up it might make sense to go for option sell and rent until the bubble pops because you could perhaps capture some of the gain so what real benefit have gotten as homeowner by rising real estate prices pay more in property taxes now and other people around me who rent are paying more in rent meaning they have less money to spend on other things it the real estate agents who have played big role in talking up this market bring on the correction lower prices will be good for those who don yet own homes and they won hurt those of us who have been in our homes for several years it going to hurt for those who have bought in the last couple of years though they ll have to consider it an expensive lesson in buying high and selling low

well this is us specific so can judge too well but one thing of the analysis seemed strange to me and that when he said that the normal situation is that rent is higher than mortgage payment that not and has never been the situation where live spain and it strikes me as weird arrangement when you re renting you re paying every month and don get anything at the end why would you pay more for less if were to choose whether to rent or mortgage and mortgaging were cheaper what would be the advantage of renting that would justify me paying more just don get this
best line of the article was set up yes you were and you got caught dipshit
there nothing to refute since you didn describe what you mean by we all fail whatever maximises your companies expected value or optimal for society suspect there may be beg the question fallacy involved where agreeing with your idea of greedy decisions being optimal and disagreeing is failure
um rent is always higher than the mortage payment the difference is profit to the landowner if the landlord payment to the bank his mortgage payment was lower than the tenant rent the landlord would make no profit and would therefore have no incentive to rent the building the author is saying that during housing market crash the rent prices fall below what the landlord pays for his mortgage payment and the landlord ends up owing more to the bank than the he gets in rent from the tenant most people rent instead of buy because they don have enough money for downpayment for mortgage maybe this is just language

as stated somewhere else reckon it isn politically correct statement among others it goes against christian dogma but eh couple of fine chaps like galileo did so not ashamed to be in such company don know her and projecting some of my personnal views on her that exactly the purpose of her mediatization maybe she disgusted with life maybe she spends her lifetime dreaming she was dead on that day maybe she feels definitely lost for sane social interaction for bearing and rising kids surely her life is permanent physical suffering probably does she rightly bet that this suffering will only end with her death maybe she sees little purpose in her surviving and has little hope to find such purpose in the future or maybe she thinks that what she endures is god will that it has an inneffable meaning that demonstrating her outstanding courage is of crucial importance maybe she loves her medicalised life with it suffering horrors etc just as job did on his manure heap have as little or as much ground to claim the former as you have to claim the latter certainly wouldn hold the same speach had she personnaly taken part in the discussion but here she only substrate on which we grow discussion or more general interest so we don have to care too much about betraying her philosophical stand had she one however strongly disagree with your claim that she has endured horrific pain and agony in order to live ve been living with an intensive care doctor and ve got no illusion about who fights for survival doctors do whatever it takes to keep people technically alive with little to no consideration for the kind of life it might be they give no opportunity to the patient to choose between life and death would add that many doctors do it as zur macht_ move http en wikipedia org wiki nietzsche which is awfully ungodly if you look at it from religious standpoint and cursed such prominent figures as moses bottom line is if you didn make conscious choice then there is no courage involved nothing indicates that she ever had an opportunity to make choice and my experience with physicians makes me strongly believe that she never had one bit of philosophy theology to finish you write she is human being and courageous survivor to me that is beautiful ve already written what think of this courage about her being survivor what does it mean the end of her life is indeed slightly delayed she going to suffer skin cancers general bad health due to lack of physical activity various other organic dysfunctions and probably lack of reasons to enjoy life so don expect her to live very old would find it beautiful if these years were put to use into something that surpasses her personnal life merely staying alive isn exactly such sublime thing my dog would do the same your life only worth what you make of it really don buy the this is beautiful proof of courage thing that mumbo jumbo repeated by religious people to cover how difficult it is to see god will in world which has always seemed unfair and where now humanity power grows at such insane speed that most of theological views become obsolete instantaneous couple of decades instantaneous for theology what was god will the crash her survival the conditions of this survival doctors being able and willing to maintains her alive why would this very high tech artificial survival medical effort be godly whereas say articifial fecundation or contraception would be ungodly can remind you that until no so long ago opening corpses to improve medical knowledge and power was considered as terribly ungodly and would grant you death by burning the whole standpoint of ethics including religion about survival has been blown by the pace of medical progress it will take decades before we adapt our ethics to these new conditions that won be too much of heartbreak for secular ethics otoh religious views which pretend to be eternal will suffer much more from that twist
there is no way to get evidence that fraudolent clicks are originated from the adsense account owner if google closes every account target of fraudolent clicks we have nice attack against every adsense user that is our enemy this appears too stupid right still how do you get evidence about the source adsl have dynamic ips google should not try to match the ip address of fraund with the one used to authenticate to adsense well moreover who wants to fraund is smart enough in most cases to use different ip addresses that appear to be unrelated and not connected to the original account so guess there is some truth in this story

not sure understand why most geeks want to work with google it great company but still it company you are working for to work for yourself can be much more interesting and there are always stuff to do like interesting web services or other technologies that will be overlooked by google and other big companies
agree with you google is showing tendency of becoming the new ms when company gets so huge it loses its innocence
it fair point but think of what you learn from the people that work their and the technology they use never mind the free haircuts and massages
actually you are right forgot to add one think if you found startup you have to make sure to work with people as smart as you are or smarter this way you will learn lot too in google you may learn things that you will hardly discover with your hacker friends but this stuff are often useful if you have to handle huge amount of information like google does not that it is not valuable but maybe working with your smart friends you can learn much more about the art of programming even if the environment is sane don think at google you can spend hours working together with your friends exploring new programming abstractions expecially if you are at your early stage of hacking another thing you probably can do is to use ruby or scheme or smalltalk instead of python for some people this can be strong point last point there is something very disturbing about google it said they hire only phds if this is true it is not the company with the philosophy may like to work for

if you read the first article this was part two you can see that he predicted that it would crash as opposed to the people who predicted that it would go on forever dow going to and that kind of statements predicting that the housing bubble will crash between now and five years is pretty relevant for any people that have mortgages with more then five years to go

very interesting but old article look at how much has changed since then capital cities who try disney abc and the whole viacom tv radio corporation that being said only buy the broadcast tv radio complaint the broadcast stations should be responsible to have programming the viewers want tolerate see plenty of competition in the magazine industry by separate owners competing for the same target audience dont know enough about the newspapers but the only strange practices have seen are between washington post nyt and sometimes la times but dont think they share the same owners any newer articles posted and why does reverend moon own the washington times
prison is not about motivating people to follow the law it is about reforming criminals that said it does motivate people to follow the law and it does not reform criminals there are many many problems with the prison system and its good to see an indepth article covering the issue it is an issue often ignored because it is so hard to come to terms with
wonder if these patterns are different for prison populations in different parts of the world do other systems do better job of dealing with it

thats not always the case you might want to own property for some reason and since you dont have lots and lots of cash you get mortage then you decide to help you out you charge rent there are so many different reasons for owning and renting don think monthly profit is an absolute sure if you bought property specifically to rent it out at profit your rent is gonna be higher but think its more likely to be long term investment rather then short term profit decision to get mortage you have to put down thousands of dollars you probably wont even recoup that from rent profit for few years even more true the more you put down
saw that coming

this is very concerning indeed what is needed is similar applications with tighter access controls set by the maker of the profile its understandable that since the entire business models of these sites relies on them having as much info as possible about you for targeted advertising these sites provide possibly the most accurate and easiest to use resource for mining information about groups of people fears of some nsa government conspiracies aside the potential for abuse of these systems has already been proven private schools have gone apeshit in in the last year doing things like registering on facebook and looking for anything even simply thoughts or jokes that could be interpreted as violating school policy this is huge problem would be surprised if government agencies don start using this information to screen new hires in the short term would suggest that you dont use your real name to register for sites like facebook since they are nice enough to not let you change it after from experience ll let you know that otherwise you ll have to use it knowing that everything you write your pictures groups and friends can and will be monitored by your school and possibly others an example recently some friends of mine were nearly suspended just for being in group that mentioned drinking on campus can here some of you now whining that that no big deal but just think of how much this could cost the students year of tuition hundreds of hours of community service which is as expensive as overtime given that he is already busy new living expenses etc the potential of private schools to censor and penalize students for communication that is intended to be private amoung themselves is rapidly increasing now you would expect that since fb has number of privacy measures mostly through limiting visibility of profiles it would be much more creative and relaxed environment well it isn and it boring as heck unless your writing cute little love letters to all your friends it gotten much worse lately as many have realized that whatever they write the wrong people will find out about it this is direct failure of the privacy mechanisms that the site setup to think lessen this fear if you look at the other side of the spectrum myspace were your name is whatever you want everyone writes all about their drunken sex parties and even slip porn in now and then you ll see something closer to the creative and fun place that the net could provide not to mention that everyone doesn seem so scared too bad the site is focused on yo girls so why am complaining so much and what can be done about it my idea which have roughly implemented is as follows basically my solution is to create trust based authentication system for example in system similar to these sites the visibility of bob profile could be degraded based on the amount that bob and or bob friends trusts the viewer alice for the most part everything would be transparent except that bob would now be able to rate his friends in different categories such as trustworthiness and then optionally tune these ranking thresholds to correspond to levels of visibility of course the challenge of this is making it totally distributed and backed by crypto to ensure that the rules are followed regardless of subpoenas which my implementation demonstrates ve drafted up few papers and have plenty of implementation code if anyone wants to take look so what does everyone else think anyone with better ideas or maybe your all happy living in glass house sure that anyone that has done extensive non business communication online has been bitten when the wrong person read things you wrote that weren intended for her tim is there any reason that these comment boxes are so tiny oh and when is reddit blogs going live

when you have singular institution public education charged with providing something to broad range of consumers which in the us is growing more and more diverse each day there have to be some rules about what is covered and what is not you just don have time to cover everything for me this isn fundamentalist atheist argument it more question of how to manage the multitude of diverse opinions on topics that must be taught in schools unless something is an absolute fact we should include the most commonly held views as those that should be taught making sure to mention that there are other points of view that are different as such believe there should be at least one other option mentioned when it comes to how we got here obviously whether you believe it or not don the theory of evolution deserves to have the lion share of time devoted to it however there should be mention that there are other points of view surprised that since there are so many people in this country who claim to believe in god there wouldn be more than passing interest in the concept of id when we talk about the separation of church and state we usually think about it meaning that the church is not to be the state we definitely bend over backwards to make sure of that just look at all the christmas channukah holiday debates we just came out of week ago however we also should look at the other side of the coin there the state is not to be the church and when you talk about the origin of the world you are engaging in both scientific and religious terms many people would love to be able to send their children to religious school however those who want to do so face major handicap they must pay for their child education while the tax money they have contributed goes to public school don want to turn this into voucher debate one controversial topic at time please but this problem does make it more difficult for regular people to send their kids to religious school than to public one anyway just my

the article author comments on being wage slave with his youthful experience of years and it shows let quickly visit some nuggets of wisdom common programmers may expect to earn at least year but it is rare for even superstar programmers to command above excepting very specialized markets like kernel driver development the to range for an annual salary is characteristic of career to which the property slave is attached interesting but in taking the full risk and reward of the enterprise upon himself the programmer who is not sorely wanting in skills of business development or marketing must soon find himself enjoying the fruits of his labors albeit many times only after years of difficult and uncertain unpaid labor it is astonishing to find that this is held as some sort of dreamlike gold standard mr weekly apparently has failed to consider the depth to which years of difficult and uncertain unpaid labor might cause many individuals to be satisfied with their salaries some of them might even have such as student loan payments mortgages or families to take care of oh what the hell quit your job anyway duties be damned there pot of gold at the end of that rainbow wages and debt go hand in hand for creditors only make loans which can be repaid regularly therefore the single most important question they ask when ascertaining credit is one present wages mr weekly is quite unfamiliar with the fico credit score which has no direct reference to one income bankers do care about income but they care far more about your fidelity to their debts the theory goes if you ve reliably met your financial obligations in the past you ll probably meet them again in the future regardless of income it pretty good theory as far as the actual heart of the article goes mr weekly seriously devalues and brushes aside the invaluable work performed by the rest of company to which programmer gives his allegiance think many project managers executive officers salesmen and marketers would object to the fact that mere sprinkling of their skills is all that is necessary to turn decent piece of software into what the author implies is near unlimited wage free source of wealth but at least he encourages the reader to avoid wanton debt that worth something suppose

libertarian in one and centrist pragmatist in the other don think either quiz is biased
was summarizing the article not the first observer to compare the nolan quiz with religious evangelism the comparison is hard to avoid do you understand the concept of an analogy when someone says these poll numbers are as shaky as cafeteria jello they do not mean that polling is related to jello they are trying to use ideas from one to describe another so in this particular instance religions and cults often put out questionaires with leading questions that try to get you to conclude you re special sort of person and they can help you if you join and for the case of economics was saying that they were both irrational systems of belief in some form of higher power

rang starbucks once and asked them why they did this they said there wasn room on the menu to fit the short sizes in ha anyway this is rather old news other papers have covered the starbucks short issue personally think his explanation is weak but what this guy leaves out is crucial fact how to get served this short size coffee starbucks staff are told if someone asks for small serve tall that oz cup if someone asks for medium serve tall whatever they ask for serve tall the only way you can get short oz size is to specifically ask for short whether cappuchino mocha latte whatever sometimes the staff will deny there is any such size but that because they are stupid usually there is no hassle sometimes they will claim that they don have the right size cups in which case point them over to the children milk size cups which is the only place an oz appears on standard starbucks menu and say that one don do it to be pain in the butt just don want to drink so much liquid and it mildly very mildly subversive
what non religious group of evangelists put out questionaires with leading questions that try to get you to conclude you re special sort of person and they can help you if you join furthermore you missed my point wasn asserting that the quiz was religious myself was quoting someone else this is probably not the best forum for discussing my article however nothing in the piece http www aaronsw com weblog claims that economies are unknowable and any religious person would sometimes admit god fails and human solution must be implemented my claim is simply that mandatory economic education should be resisted for the same reason mandatory religious education should because it factually baseless and politically harmful

another good one from greenspun gt calculated that the students were paying about in tuition lecture hour withdrew stack of bills from my bankboston account and handed one out to each undergraduate in the course then proceeded to give my talk telling the students that was happy to teach them but was not going to take their money
forget where read about this idea but apparently sometime in the past students used to pay their professors individually which might be solution to some of the problems phil is talking about that would certainly cut down on the bureaucracy since it would be very evident exactly how much money was going toward administrative overhead also the education market is currently distorted by government loans and subsidies universities charge more because students abilities to pay are artificially increased by the government

interestingly the phrase organized religion bashing and neutralization of moral outcry reminded me more of the actions of liberals over the past years than the gop over the past six years not that you had accused anyone of any such thing the exerpt from the book had already put that thought in my mind what see is the left and the right in america are pulling us steadily away from libertarianism through both the social programs and political correctness of the left and the crack down on personal freedoms of the right war on drugs the distinction mentioned in the nd paragraph of the article between the ruling and the ruled has been put in place nearly half the country thinks we are reliant on the government economically and most of the other half thinks we are reliant on it for moral guidance in both cases few seem to be aware the important issue is reliance on big brother that has been accepted by nearly all the opposite of totalitarianism communism socialism on the left or naziism fascism on the right is libertarianism objectivism until we learn as country of individuals to be self reliant we will continue to move in dangerous direction

hmm all commenters so far have ignored what seems to me to be the author real point in writing this article which comes near the end namely that the heterosexual homosexual identity dichotomy has been constructed only in the past century by christians and or middle class intellectuals and does not make sense think people in general spend way too much time categorizing people knew guy in college who married gal they are still married but in the meantime he had sex change and is now she does that make them both lesbians similarly what about people with xy chromosomes who exhibit female body types and what about other intersex people never mind hetero homo it become clear to me that even male female is in the end false dichotomy

must have been such procrastinator today to go through all what was written about it procrastination it could have been nicer if the author rattled bit less in his vivd thoughts really even have missed an important errand to do what was it oh yeah having my daily ice cream

get enraged whenever hear about the telcos trying to price different content and this article makes good points but it always feels like they are forgetting that the internet is not way medium many of the benifits are people putting out their own data and this will become increasingly true with legit so now they will make it so that only the rich can take part in multimedia delivery we be pretty much back to tv and that pisses me off
nyt article few weeks ago on the size of college and university endowments made it plain that for many of the top universities with endowments measured in the tens of billions of dollars undergraduate tuition could be paid in full without touching the principal also in case anybody missed it the post is from it was the we don have relational database servers available for student use line that first tipped me off

have you ever thought the methan releases what meat industry is cousing to the atmosphere or how much they cut rainforests to have some room to cows for example many good things can be done poorly or nicely whith results there is plenty of animal rights and ethical treatment groups which don use sensation driven advertising and give us informative news encourage everybody to support them here in finland for example is animalia group and have an argument about animal testing animal testing doesn give scientist relevant results compared to clinical testing for example only thing why they use animal testing is becouse it cheap but think that they should develop alternative methods becouse it is really unethical animal treatment yeah that holocaust thing was really vulgar and doesn give good thoughts about animal rights
agree with mattmozzo animal welfare is way on the bottom of the list human welfare is more important other causes that seek to improve human life is far more important
this is one of your best essays yet in my opinion pulling together so many things you ve touched on in past ones you have an incredible gift for clear thinking synthesis and communication wish could have read you when was in my teens because that when so many of us were so ill guided by the befuddled others in this world as the other guy said long live and prosper and keep writing
think this was good article but it might be nice if somebody had put nsfw not safe for work in the title
it haskell is better language almost stopped reading there obvious bias yes kept reading not much of point except haskell community needs work what community
needs work okay idea
yeah was thinking much the same way as you this article just sounds like they took one of dozens articles about lisp and replaced lisp with haskell
was actually referring to stuff like this section from http philip greenspun com panda server programming you would think that picking web site development language would be trivial obviously the best languages are safe and incorporate powerful object systems so let do everything in common lisp or java computer scientists can believe that scripting language could be as good as lisp and better than java for developing internet applications but it turns out to be almost true scripting language is better than java because scripting langauge doesn have to be compiled scripting language can be better than lisp because string manipulation is simpler while specific choices of technology rarely age well unless the choice is lisp or maybe fortran his explanation of the problem domain is excellent and explains some of the reasons behind ror clobbering java and lisp in web programming

think the author was presumptuous how do you know that it lack of community maybe there is another reason for instance communities tend to have leadership the perl community has real luminaries but the luminaries have humility and tend to defer to larry wall no in python land there are some big brains around but people let guido van rossom make the final decisions ruby matz familiar with the lisp community enough to know that there are no clear leaders and the same marginalized language complaint can be made of lisp it presumptuous to elevate the corellation to cause without some reasoning to back it up
as george bernard shaw said the single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place
this is just old the haskell community already knows this and has discussed it for several years to counter just of his points haskell org shouldn promote specific distribution haskell is standardized language that is implemented by several compilers interpreters ruby python and perl his examples are languages with canonical implementation that more or less is the language haskell has several implementations with different uses and goals all or the most relevant to newcomer any way are presented on the homepage along with what they are good at potential user has to make choice and if he looks at tutorial they will likely recommend one
this is recycled news from about years ago or more but it huge problem it not just with electronic parts but also us companies going into third world countries and setting up plants that pollute like that wouldn be able to here the fact is most third world countries would rather have polluting us company than no us company at all the us should hold their companies to the standards that exist here not elsewhere
and where despite it all fewer people attend university than in the us not well known but it true
going to do bold statement haskell is way too low level more precisely my claims are that language is low level when it makes certain things more difficult to express than necessary the casual contrieved recipes to circumvent this inexpressivness are called design patterns therefore omnipresence of design patterns in language structure is sign that this language is low level as soon as you want to do os or anything vaguely stateful in haskell you need beginner unfriendly monads which definitely are design pattern and difficult to understand one gt haskell is too low level in contexts where you want to do something stateful and typical example of something stateful is the real world don misread me love haskell when used at its intended purpose modelize highly logical algorithmical stuff in perfectly clean way only that very narrow niche most of what we actually do is unnecessarily complex to express that way the same way you could do system programming in prolog but shouldn
the simons seem to lead the haskell community peyton jones and marlow

you just don realize what pound hardcover anthology feels like until you hold one highly recommend trip to barnes and noble or amazon

ohh yeah if this continue we might as well get it over with and just post them all at once
gt the fact that perl python and ruby have become popular while haskell has stayed marginal language is failure of the haskell community it sounds like the author is faulting the haskell community for not trying hard enough or something but it seems to me that the reason haskell is unpopular is that it just isn the kind of language that fated to be popular right now disclosure lisp guy so only partly qualified for this but think that at least part of the reason for haskell and lisp unpopularity is that they don go out of their way to provide stuff that the so called average programmer takes for granted like easy and infix notation haskell and lisp respective communities have their reasons which are perfectly legitimate but they at least lot of lispers and the author of this post haven come to terms with the fact that if unconventional or revolutionary or unique are part of what your language is it not likely to be embraced by the mainstream quickly changing people minds takes time and trying harder to make that happen is like trying harder to strike match on wet cake of soap of course none of this is meant to suggest that standardizing on single distribution and whatnot aren good idea that would make lisp lot nicer too
sorry not basic enough how about explanations each step of the way of what or or are

they re not adding new content they re just shooting for higher karma and they re being lazy about it in order yes they are by definition because they couldn post the article if it was already posted possibly but so what and no they aren at least not any more lazy than most of the people who run across an interesting article and think hey this should be on reddit imo if someone posts an article here or to any site of this nature that article should be judged solely on what it has to offer that the whole point isn it if you find the article stupid pointless redundant or too similar to something that was just posted then by all means knock it down but if you re trying to judge whether the poster intent was pure enough or whether he broke enough of sweat hunting it down maybe you re going about this the wrong way then again maybe just taking this whole thing way too seriously

slashdot does seem to have real problem with some of the site but the community is too good to be replaced by digg the comments at digg are just worthless go to slashdot to read the comments not the articles thats why im happy reddit added comment system with voting it has potential to create community where good posts are encouraged and bad ones discouraged hope slashdot doesn die just hope they will rewrite their site and do something about the editors that everyone always complains about as much as the community rocks if things keep stagnating then one of these sites might just take it over
such insight the blogger has the hyperlink to the alexa would have been sufficient

it looks http www alexa com data details traffic_details amp range amp size medium amp compare_sites digg com reddit com amp amp url slashdot org top to be marching along quite well considering it is so much younger than either slashdot or even digg

neat
who cares if people really hate it they ll abandon myspace and find nearest competitor it so easy to do that that the only reason people won and they won is inertia this is prime example of such simple power consumers have in their hands to shape their world power so easy to exercise that the real news is that people are more inclined to whine about it than fix their problems and many of these people complaining about the greedy corporations oppressing them are the same people who rightly tell the moralists to change the channel if they don like sex and violence on tv

interesting read on the whole but one point caught my eye bonded child labourers in india know quite few people in the diamond cutting and polishing industry in india and ve visited many such factories ve never seen child or woman working in these places the people who work there are highly skilled and earn decent wage the article references report on bonded child labour in india which is sad truth but not in this particular industry the report actually refers to american diamonds cubic zirconium and not real diamonds

javascript is very powerful language one may wonder why not to write server side stuff in javascript in order to have the same language both at the client and server level of course it is much more pratical to write server side stuff in javascript than to adopt another client side language and given that javascript is much better than php and java for many tasks it shame there isn something like mod_javascript for apache including nice fast implementation decent libraries access to sql dbs and so on note that while the need for unification had little justification in the past ajax applications are forcing us to write big part of web applications in javascript so something is different now
good luck you are going to be slapping lot of girls
read the list for finland first and felt it was mostly accurate native then saw the original for sweden and was bit shocked about how much of that stuff actually describes both finland and sweden wonder how the list would look if it was written by swedish expat living in finland or vice versa the herring bit should probably not have been copied to the finland list though finnish people actually eat very little fish and the white socks situation has passed except the very seriously fashion challenged your good mood or more likely your mediocre mood definitely does become your best mood and if your mood is affected by daylight weather just keep out seriously

more important point is that editorially closed web sites are passe
suppose in certain really extreme cases you could use eval but that would be for really extreme cases there are various tools in javascript for doing things that might call for macros in lisp afaik where lisp macros are used they are not usually essential just way to cut down complexity and redundancy and that what targetting here would have to see an example to try to create real equivalent javascript has object literals and builtin for in operation which are the equivalent of dictionary or association list elsewhere use simple function for creating html through the dom interface that takes an object with some of the properties tag attributes children etc and creates dom nodes based on it the resulting code is about of the size and complexity of equivalent code that uses the dom functions directly for this reason object heavily to modifying the object prototype object since each added function will show up in for in operation another tool is doing wacky things with object prototypes and binding functions to objects setting aside the oo vs functional debate this is very handy at times also in any function the arguments are available as the array arguments which can be used creatively though not always constructively would like to see lisp like system where you can make macros by messing with the parse tree but even that would not be nearly as useful as lips macros you could roll your own macro system by writing some text manipulation functions loading javascripts in as strings processing them and then loading them into the runtime with eval

its sad that the reasons the chinese can get things done so fast is because they dont have hangups with good governance and human rights at the same time does that make them wrong they are possibly on to solution for africa problems the creation of infrastructure the apparent problem with western aide to africa was not that there wasnt enough but that it does nothing so here we have chinese coming in and doing things and doing them fast ve been to china and they work fast so now we have chinese violating all kinds of moral principles but in doing so they are accomplishing what the moral west cant it seems to me that we westerners havn gotten over cultural imperialism we have to have things done our way and because our way is the right way it will produce the right results it is becoming increasingly clear that this is not really the case especially in africa while some may deride the chinese for going about things in the wrong way they are the only ones getting the right results
hah great
geez first there was the web now there the internet where will this madness stop
that was clever guess this does bring up an interesting discussion on privacy think privacy is becoming more of something that you have to actively protect rather then assume is respected furthermore people will quickly begin to realize that publishing information about yourself is surefire way to surrender your privacy think issues like this site and myspace will be issues we will be dealing with for while but the next generation will probably be used to more open and connected existence

just wondering what reddit needs to do to get noticed guess it might just take time but the comment system on reddit is excellent for one it has threaded discussions and does them very well the formatting tools are very easy to use and love how voting comment up or down is no different than voting link up and down that just makes sense and its intuitive also think that reddit system of just having descriptive title instead of title and description is very wise you can see many more stories if you see title that looks interesting you actually look at the link on digg most of the time the title is worthless and all the thought it put into the description or vice versa its just redundant and then on digg you have the problem of people only reading the description and digging it based on that and reddit is just clean wish had come up with the layout myself its just very simple and it gets things done for that think spez and kn thing are genius well the whole site is genius but reddit really does have that same simplicity that made google the bomb also its got the mascot that all need to say about him right now it just seems like you got digg and slashdot slugging it out and reddit is kind of the odd man out that no one really notices but maybe that is good thing because right now the community is very good you for example enjahova ve already spoken with you in several link discussions and though we disagreed on few things think it was done respectfully with the massive amount of people who use both digg and slashdot its much harder to recognize people and you don get the same respect while discussing one of the few things that irks me about reddit is how some things are voted down just because of mindset someone has link or comment can be constructive and well though out and can even be right but just because people don agree with that viewpoint they vote it down that doesn seem to be much of problem right now have noticed it few times but it might become bigger problem as the site grows
this was on slashdot long ago most likely vaporware for now

ve always been intrigued by the idea of javascript being used server side its good language and since it is so common client side it would only make sense to use it server side guess its only matter of time before someone figures this out and does something about it
agree on the whole with your post and yeah have noticed that we have had previous discussions it is really what enjoy most the news may be interesting but its more interesting to get lots of peoples perspectives on it as far voting on comments and links goes think the system will take care of itself barring organized attempts at trolling think that everyone can vote encourages better discussion if you just post something on whim you will be more likely to be voted down in an instant if you post with respect and merrit you will probably get voted up the people quick to vote up down on mood should balance each other out guess that leaves an interesting problem that wonder if spez and kn thing have considered sure they have what about automated abuses can accounts be registered to vote link up or comment up sure right now that would be noticeable but if you had nearly million user count like slashdot what would stop it guess these are the more interesting problems the creators are working on as the site expands now that they gave us comments
wow very interesting
recently had the opportunity to interview reddit com founder alexis ohanian about the inspiration behind the site the current state and the future of social news promotion
gt guess that leaves an interesting problem that wonder if spez and kn thing have considered sure they have what about automated abuses can accounts be registered to vote link up or comment up sure right now that would be noticeable but if you had nearly million user count like slashdot what would stop it this is something that happened on digg very recently single guy would register few new accounts each day and use those accounts to promote demote stories he then took it step further and created many accounts and started spamming the comment system at digg to prove point every single story on the frontpage had over comments via his automated bot its def something that has to be watched out for on sites like this really the only way to combat it is to have some intelligent algorithms working in the background

heard somewhere that diamonds are not that rare as ppl think and that this is part of the global plan of keeping the prices high thats why the diamond market is heavily controlled if the amount of diamonds on the market were allowed to increase the prices would of course drop

think one of the main flaws of slashdot has been the scope of the site the title of slashdot says it best news for nerds stuff that matters but lot of news that does matter doesn get covered enjoy slashdot but at times it is too technical and irrelevant for my taste this is where think reddit has it covered there is an adaquate cross section to cover numerous tastes from computers programming to recent news and events it makes the task of parsing through slashdot unnecessary when can just go to reddit
hmmm interesting prediction and yes will be long time dying but he really only came up with points has dictator editors and they are getting older is the writer perhaps forgetting that the fan base is also aging with the editors mean if manages to maintain its appeal on visitors and keep them the editors aging isn an issue is it however if all is is gimmicky cool things of the moment included by editors then yeah the gap will kill it sites like sparknotes come to mind liked it when was in high school and then quickly dumped it when found less stupid and jackass type things to spend my time on nerdom though tend to be lifetime pursuit
the diamond industry as whole is totally propped up by debeers however in relation to your comment about the supply of diamonds it appears that the one source of diamonds that debeers can fully control is us the people who have diamonds in our possession http www com diamond chap htm its funny people are always fast to bash microsoft for their monopoly but few people seem to care about the debeers one
tfa actually talks about reddit lot even though reddit isn major player just yet

hear you but that why like slashdot when things are specialized and wide variety of such specialization exists things are good think nature reddit is cool and hot for the most interesting and sometimes relavent news but as reddit fanbase grows can expect to see cool things particular to my programming gaming nerdy tastes all the time anymore there are plenty of sources for new events google news for example but fewer specialized filters such as this one and for that reason is precious to nerds at least for now
you could have given it little more layout had to guess what are the questions and what the answers
canadian diamonds are distributed by member corporations of the de beers cartel so are russian diamonds so while you are not buying conflict diamond you are helping de beers amp increasing the profitability of conflict diamonds just don buy diamonds moissanite is prettier anyway amethyst is more rare as are any precious gemstones
it good questions the register is asking google should explain themselves on the other hand do no evil does not imply do good
think that they didn submerge everything you can still see harddrive on top of the box
regardless of how clean or well implemented reddit comments are they don beat real moderation system and the ability to filter based on it something that should be obvious but doesn always seem to be about these sites is that technology implementation cleanness etc are virtually meaningless the only value in these sites is the community and it parameters are mostly unaffected by the type of technology being used or the quality of the page layout oh and digg reddit are not exactly the first people to invent news sites aggregators with loose editorial control either
just shortcut list of meme web democracy links
yes but the problem is you re not going to get much money for your nd hand diamonds are you the end customers are just selling their diamonds to other end customers or pawn shops which will still keep the diamonds within that sphere jewelers too will pay you fraction of the original value that way the gems aren allowed to recirculate the market it one way street guess it like that song diamonds are forever

while your points make sense think the technology implementation and cleanness promote better community first of all take digg their stories are of interest to most people from slashdot but their comment system is trash and allows for the crap that people post on it then take reddit think right now it is small and the comment system is good enough do agree that moderation system with filtering will probably be needed who knows maybe these guys will come up with new way to do forums think the point is that the technology and implementation allowed for the community of slashdot to flurish and people like me who come late to the scene appreciate just reading comments that give me insight into things couldn get just from the articles my visiting to reddit went up huge amount per day when they added comments and it can still take away some forum real estate from slashdot if it fosters this community this means that they will have to improve on this system more though

this afternoon was thinking of sorting blogs and forums by iq of the people who make comments there it probably look like this for starters reddit thank you very much zawodny blog slashdot kottke kuro hin engadget myspace fark digg
while we re commenting on the site design dislike that there no static most recent good stories page like there is on digg and slashdot sure reddit isn blog but seeing all these little particles moving around makes it hard to tell what new
what can say it made me smile
most of the outliers are actually just bunch of duplicates of some forum in different views
this article is in powerpoint like format difficult to read some good points though seriously though xml is fine and dandy thing so are csv files and so are tab seperated files it all matter of when to use them and how feel the trouble with xml and it driven me up the wall is the insane amount of pure hype that surrounds it ve seen entire blogs that do nothing but whitter on about xml it all about horses for courses
don worry yahoo msn and google are still firm at the top the thing that bothers me about myspace is that it doesn seem to have point with livejournal you can read diaries blogs and journals and add comments but few people on myspace use those features what are most people doing browsing idly not good way to make someone loyal to your website

feel the same way would like reddit com to use different color to show sites that ve already visited it would also be nice if it kept track of comments that ve read comments tend to move around on the page as they are voted this makes it difficult to find new comments it would be helpful to have light shading behind comments that haven already seen
wonder if recommended will turn out to be something that that seemed like core feature at first but will be eclipsed by other aspects of the site as it grows it the most un social of the various ways to view links often my ratings have as much to do with how page says something as what it about have hard time imagining being able to provide enough raw data to ensure really interesting predictions

how about purple
don necessarily disagree with you but place like myspace can strictly be considered product it community too thus in some ways telling someone to change sites is akin to telling someone to leave their city or country places like world of warcraft now have currencies translatable to real world dollars we are only at the beginning of this type of thing and these type of user versus site owner conflicts will be bigger deal in the years to come
the random bullets are what the audience actually saw must have been painful you call this visual aid
yeah the sites you ve already visited are already labeled in purple this is not due to the history in your browser if you switch browsers or machines the set of links will be shown as visited
guys picking up chicks girls trying to grab attention actually and it works very well sex sells big not to mention the way that everything is split onto million pages combined with the extensive personal info that the site users give out has driven advertising throught the roof and sorry but all those kids have given myspace much more traffic traffic than google just because the tech community is getting bobarded with googletizement articles every day doesn mean google is king see http reddit com goto id it racked up billion pageviews in august more than google and new users are signing up at stunning rate of million month shutter to see were the traffic will peak
is combinator function that takes function and returns another function is function that takes number or function and returns number or calls the function is number so applies its argument to itself this means it makes recursive function of its argument this means in turn that its argument must be function capable of taking functional argument note that fills this description so you can write nonrecursive function note that fact nr is not recursive and then pass that nonrecursive function to which will make it traditional recursive factorial just like we have all written the first time we try out new lisp but why do all this if this were all there is to combinators no one would use them but combinators can be used to fundamentally change the way function calls work in your language for instance memoization can be an interesting technique you can memorize the value of function call and then just return that when you get the same call again if your language supports combinators you can hack in memoization yourself this is very cool will try to write an essay about this in my copious spare time

see if your school has something like an undergraduate research opportunities program urop these seem to be relatively common and typically provide something on the order of to for work on research projects under faculty member not much money but it is start this can be supplemented by additional grant money if it can be found well connected faculty member can help it might be possible for your department to create short term job position for you if it has the funds available this is big if and depends on lot of factors extra department cash compliant faculty member compelling project for student projects it will be easier to find funding if you are working on something that qualifies as research problem try to show potential funders that your idea is worth sinking couple grand into if you re thinking of some kind of message board web buzzword crap you will have problems not that this junk isn interesting but much has already been done by people with more resources and experience it not really that innovative from cs perspective ooh tagging and as result the educational advantages would be slim ve focused on academic funding sources since much of the commercial world has problems understanding oss since oss scares many of the intellectual property trolls they will not be too inclined to risk cash for what they perceive as no return in any case it would be helpful to develop working relationship with faculty member with related interests this will bring you drastically more benefit than trying to whore yourself out to business working with faculty can also make for references when it is time to whore yourself out to business or graduate shcools summary define your project as research problem find faculty mentor hope this helps

it true some people would rather believe in heaven and jesus and friends but it doesn make it any less delusional just like someone might believe the moon landings didn happen or that they re napolean to use dawkins example these are all still delusions and think it terrifying that we allow people with such severe psychological problems to run our countries

from the article the idea of an afterlife where you can be reunited with loved ones can be immensely consoling though not to me but to maintain such belief in the face of all the evidence to the contrary is truly bewildering sure he said more in other contexts about this but as it stands this statement is rather bewildering itself what exactly is the evidence he refers to which demonstrates that there is no afterlife find it hard to even imagine what kind of assume he must mean scientific evidence there could possibly be which would demonstrate this must say also find it rather humorous for the man to be getting all worked up at the fact that the right meme is not winning or that it losing or that it not winning fast enough or whatever

think maybe there are two levels of belief to be dealt with there are beliefs about facts and metabeliefs about how you come to your beliefs about facts the only belief that would say have is metabelief in the correctness of the scientific method for deciding what is fact and in that context most religious people have two metabeliefs one saying that the scientific method is one way of obtaining facts and another saying that the bible ku ran talmud etc is also source for facts along with historical and modern interpretaions of their specific religious tradition would claim that religous people are delusional because think that the facts they believe are not true facts but that is not philisophicaly sound position because it comes down to the fact that don agree with one of their metabeliefs which is subjective however if we are to demand simplicity then holding two metabeliefs when one suffices is clearly excessive so then we re left with atheists who only metabelief is in the scientific method and fundamentalists who only belief is in the religious tradition of their choice not sure how many fundamentalists there are who truly reject all knowledge obtained from the scientific method but hope they don drive cars
reading below believers in god are called delusional irrirational blind etc why is it that non believers get so upset because someone doesn buy the theory that our complex being was created by accident not convinced that we were created by accident and the ancient theories of evolution don explain how we were created science blows all kinds of holes in the theory that we evolved from non living material that said think evolution and creationism are not mutually exclusive no doubt species have evolved over time to get stronger however evolution doesn provide enough evidence to support our creation
agree if mod down an article with the basic premise that computers suck and mod up and article with the basic premise that computers rule does this result in net change in what the engine will recomend me think they need to clarify the effects of modding should mod down when an article is uninteresting to me or only if disagree with it
there are many reasons we get upset so ll just present one of them you don accept the idea that living matter came about from inorganic materials but instead believe that some intelligent being somehow caused it to happen presumably you justify this belief by saying that science hasn adequately explained how that particular event occurred which is true but then how do you choose which of the hugely numerous intelligent beings have been hypothesised by man to explain current gaps in his scientific knowledge why the christian god over the muslim god why buddha over fsm there is no possible rational reason
if you find that the scientific method is lacking in explaining how we were created how we evolved why do you feel that the bible offers any better explanation if you feel bad about holes in the theory that we evolved from non living material how does genesis make you feel was raised christian and until did away with belief in god was very upset with god for numerous reasons as vicious programmer don underestimate the power of randomness and accident on humongous scale

religion is byproduct of right brain thinking it is taking good emotion and deciding that based on that feeling it must be true left brain thinking is logical something is only true if you can follow logical chain to conclusion women are more right brain thinkers than men which is why even if they aren religious they are more likely to believe in astrology and psychics etc right brain thinking is inherently selfish in nature no one else feelings matter but your own

my apologies did look for this originally but managed to mis spell overlord sheesh
you are mixing arguments debating which secular religion is better is different argument my point is that people can believe that science does not support the theory that we were spontaneously created from inorganic material and still be rational human beings for example sub cellular protien based machines exist that are so simple they cannot be evolved to there is no fossil evidence to suggest that intra species evolution happened it is also mentioned that people seek belief in higher being because it is comfortable would argue that it is more comfortable to believe that we explain everything away

self delusion is powerful force in athletics this is probably why you see many top athletes who are religious suspect it isn because some force is helping them simply that their delusions are more powerful when running and tired sometimes feel as though there little voice suggesting stop perhaps it common sense voice envy those with the drive to ignore the little voice in this regard while would have to pay someone to yell at me to keep going it also reminds me of the recently posted story of the person who solved the unsolved equations because he didn know they were supposed to be so hard
please sir try to maintain some standards talkorigins org for all its faults lists peer reviewed references and at least tries to the conclusions it comes to hugh ross and his organization on the other hand edit more to the point now that ve thought about it deeper is that mr ross organization frames the entire debate in terms of religion right from the get go reasons to after all that is rather telling don you think the origin of species is not religious issue to me or to most everyone on my side of the debate dawkins may beg to differ am not as vocal an atheist as he to us it matter of facts and the best possible way to explain those facts in the light of science it not about metaphysics or faith it about what the world is really like and how it got to be that way based on what we actually about it the very fact that the most vocal objections to evolutionary theory are purely religious really speaks volumes once you stop and think about it
think there is point here mean god created us from something obviously it wasn in organic that is beyond god power to create something living from rocks he she it them probably used something already living such as dolphins yes dolphins must have been first and then we must be dolphin spawns now that explains everything from living to living please don ask where god got dolphin it gets kinda tricky with rocks and stuff

good point tend to think of the digital lifestyle how apple described it documenting your exciting life go out and be active with sports hikes and other adventures play indoors or out with your ferocious and adorable kids and get it all down in clips and stills then come back to your computer and mix it up throw in some loops burn your creation to dvd and send it out to your relatives when digital lifestyle doesn involve creative energy it missing that bit about life

think it an to say your only metabelief is in the correctness of the scientific method cotsm for deciding what is fact on the one hand the cotsm belief is connected to or derived from whole set of other beliefs such as the universe and we ourselves actually exist our senses can be trusted and correspond in significant way to the reality of the universe we are not brains in vat or copper tops information which is not scientifically demonstrable is not fact my wife loves me abraham lincoln existed on the other hand philosophers and historians of science have cast lot of doubt upon the self sufficiency of the scientific method in the sense that it appears that scientists in fact do not use the scientific method as classically defined in the baconian sense nearly as rigorously as lay persons or indeed scientists themselves believe

your link is pretty funny particularly the way they twist and contort in order to try to turn paper that yet another huge verification of evolution into the opposite off the front page gt this new study identifies various noncoding or junk dna sequences in the human genome that are conserved when compared to the corresponding regions in the genomes of wide range of vertebrates conserved of course meaning conserved over evolution now perhaps the authors of reason org mean conserved in that the sense that the designer gave different species some similar stretches of dna except with minor changes that make it only appear to look like it was product of evolution rather than design isn that designer tricky fellow they then go on to imply that if there are few new annotations in the of dna that appears to be non functional then lt gt all lt gt of it must be important and not look like the huge mess of imperfection and non design that it looks like ridiculous biologists have always known that there are likely functional elements and for that very reason most avoid the term junk dna as its used in that paper summary no sir there is no way that people can believe that science does not support the theory that we were spontaneously created from inorganic material and still be rational human beings as you said unless they are simultaneously seriously misinformed and misinformation is the way that creationism persists its all load of dishonest tripe one more thing you use the word spontaneous which isn quite the way that any biologist would describe evolution which is very gradual and which is random only in half the mutation or generation of minor variations the selection half is quite non random and which eventually selects the variations that provide the slightest of advantages however do you see that the standard creationist description of the creation of man precisely what you deride humans were spontaneously here on earth created from inorganic matter

old news folks the article on networkworld com is dated yet everything described happened in last year ces forza motorsport has been out since may
the thing no one talks about is that religious belief has social function and it is probably by product of evolution think it evolved because groups with cooperative centers and competitive edges have an advantages over groups that don
sites with human editors have social problem people can become angry with the editors for any number of reasons it harder to posit conspiracy theories for reddit although we do take the karma scores on faith would it be possible to make score tracking completely transparent with publicly viewable logs
does this study cover cough expectorants it sounds like the doctors are doubting the effects of over the counter supressants but aren expectorants different beast
is not currently darknet darknet is private virtual network where users only connect to people they trust http en wikipedia org wiki darknet for example from within you can send data to and from any other node without first requiring prior authorization instead is something of mixnet its main use is to provide sender and receiver anonymity that said has been expanding nicely performance is good support for nats has finally arrived and builtin apps like special bittorrent client make it very easy to use as far as ready for prime time almost think jrandom et all have few more tricks up their sleeves before that though
an atheist myself and fundamentalists are definitely annoying but you get the feeling this dawkins wants to round them up and put them in camps or something but the article has its unintentionally hilarious moments gt he didn start out as an unbeliever dawkins was born into middle class family that went to church each christmas and then there this gem of contemptuous ignorance gt in the us the picture is rather different coming out as an atheist can cost an academic his or her job in some parts of america beware the paranoid theocracy that rules uc berkeley

reddit developers how about some way to mark links as spam
mr dawkins is an avid atheist and is anti religion what waste of reddit link space however modded this one up just so that everybody can see how far off the deep end this man has stepped his elitism is without bounds and it obvious why he has no problems looking down his nose at the world population who retain religious beliefs it easy to reject religion and any sort of belief in higher power when the world so obviously revolves around mr dawkins intellect at least he has sense of humor about it gt and what if by some mischance he were to find there is god when he dies he looks at me as if were mad the question is so preposterous that can hardly grace it with hypothetical answer he says finally but to quote bertrand russell suspect would say there not enough evidence god
the basis for christianity is not belief that the bible is as an inerrant source of truth the basis for intelligent christian thought is the belief in the life death and resurrection of jesus as recorded in the gospels which form historical rather than mystical basis do not appreciate those who represent christianity as an arbitrary blind belief either by those who believe it or those who do not the answers in genesis organization comes to mind ve attended part of one of their mind numbing weekend programs second it is correct that those who promote scientific discovery should do so at the expense of certain untenable ideas within religious systems it is not necessary to dismiss or contradict the progress of science in order to have some belief in the supernatural neither is it necessary to ridicule all religion in order to promote science think those who do should be told to stick to science and avoid public discourse science like religion should expose itself by confidence in facts not through spectacular displays of irrelevant criticism third there is behind the atheistic view of the origin of life which is that science has completely explained the origin of life this is not true scientists have yet to discover mechanisms for the appearance of life that are satisfactory science rather than speculation there are variety of unanswered scientific questions regarding the origins of the universe and life as there have always been in the history of modern science
so to sum it up paragraph believe in christ because believe in christ paragraph religious belief is special because paragraph science has only of the explanation so my belief in invisible friends is justified oh please
you ought to criticize what is written and not what is in your imagination specifically you ought to pay attention to topic sentences and conclusions rather than scanning for material that you dislike and assuming that the claim made is opposite to yours none of your critique has any important bearing on what wrote except for repetition of certain words

there is difference between saying we don know how things got started vs it was designer singular and he was like this one is honest you don buy that our complex being didn need creator when something like god complex being doesn need one equating the products of evolution with accidents is about as honest as claiming stalagmites come about by accident science doesn blow any kind of holes in the theory that the first self reproducing entity came about from non living material all science says on the matter is we don know how yet which actually has nothing to do with the theory of evolution abiogenisis like the origin of the universe is just baggage christians assumptively saddle on evolution saying science blows holes in abiogenisis is like saying science blows all kinds of holes in the idea of fusion generator we don know yet as for evolution doesn provide enough evidence the cockamamy version you ve picked up by osmosis might not provide enough evidence but if you actually go and learn about it you ll find theory that watertight and pretty much irrefutable but also demonstrable the holes in evolution you keep hearing about aren in evolution at all they are abiogenisis and the origin of the universe they are gaps in the theory of godless universe not gaps in the theory of evolution
dont think it ready for primetime yet ve used it on and off for the past months it very promising but only the most patient of users will be willing to put up with how slow it is it is cool but dont see it being popular anytime soon this article isnt even realyl about that it just some dumb blog post by some guy who thinks that it might be popular soon but he just some guy it not like an official source or anything or quote from the developers yadda yadda
how utterly irresponsible for the media to just put something like this into the minds of the public without decent qualifiers it should be made clear that the reported results of the study target the effectiveness of cough syrups against coughs caused by head colds expectorants not suppresants do help remove mucus when we re talking about chest colds

you feel it is waste of space to link to the opinions of an atheist who is anti religion you don go into any details about why this is waste however elitism is offensive true enough but occasionally it has point in the what normally should be meritocracy of academia the elites really are better qualified because they have spent years becoming so whether or not this argument applies to dawkins in particular might be argued but he surely knows more biology than you or fwiw have standing offer to any and all gods who want me to believe in them it goes like this drop by my house any friday night and ll take them down to the local bar ll order pints around the table and then ll start asking some questions if the being in question truly is divine then giving me some answers should not be too difficult and if not they can buy their own damn beer
fair enough suspect the quote is more truth than humor but revised my comment to be more fair the contempt with which he apparently holds religious adherents certainly makes it seem plausible
belief in god is about as supported and likely to be true as non belief what differs is the stench exuded from zealots on both sides of the issue the uber atheists reek of acidic condescension and the ultra religious stink of intolerance and ignorance one side struggles with the question of why there is something rather than nothing at all and the other seems to think this question has no meaning

can tolerate certain amount of jousting from the anti religion crowd but this piece on dawkins is equivalent to kkk adherent disturbed that support for civil rights is on the rise that may be bit extreme but it certainly is no different than if somebody linked to an interview with catholic cardinal as to why catholicism is so great the dawkins piece mod up points and counting the piece on the cardinal minus double digits points and probably lower it the lack of balance and at least the pretense of objectivity in these matters that is frustrating were this an article on dawkins specialty biology then would have no problem with it his so called scholarship on biology has been dealt with by scholars of his caliber or higher but take issue with the claim that the contempt of dawkins for those with religion is based on cool analysis of his academic findings and observations even the most entrenched atheists won make public comments like his even in his academic specialty he finds spectacular ways to treat the opposition it is absolutely safe to say that if you meet someone who claims not to believe in evolution that person is ignorant stupid or insane or wicked but rather not consider that
thought it was common knowledge not to buy any mac product within month of keynote address sorry dude maybe you can still return it
goodie
an atheist ve read four of dawkins books the dude gets on my last nerve and no not because he worse than or as bad as religious twits but because it so irritating that his brand of rhetoric is necessary whenever someone who is uncomfortable with technology reads or hears about alan turing original proposed test for artificial intelligence for the first time they inevitably make an objection just as inevitably that objection was covered in turing original paper on the subject no popular media has ever provided me anything new about artificial intelligence similarly religious twits will be upset and confused by reality until the heat death of the universe so read about the latest tireless efforts by richard dawkins to explain concepts that were well understood years ago and irritated irritated silly wish allen orr would write academic summary articles amp get them published somewhere we could read them

am the only one who would like real measure of how long the battery is supposed to last find it totally bizarre that they talk about its lower power consumption and all that but on the product page and just says watt hour battery with no mention of how many watts it regularly uses or what kind of battery life that equates to thought the longer battery life was supposed to be huge selling point of these but now kind of wonder if they aren mentioning it because it terrible
sadly ve gone through two powerbook ac adapters for the same reason can wait to get one of these
gt that may be bit extreme but it certainly is no different gt than if somebody linked to an interview with catholic gt cardinal as to why catholicism is so great the dawkins gt piece mod up points and counting the piece on the gt cardinal minus double digits points and probably lower don know about you but see reporting and posts about religion lot_ more often than do pieces about atheism both online and in traditional media maybe looking in the wrong places but could easily dig up half dozen interviews with various catholic strange hat wearers talking about their to me repulsive opinions on policy and society for each piece like this one spot and that even after count the atheist blogs read really the anti religion crowd is nowhere near as loud and obnoxious as the anti atheism wingnut brigade cf pat robertson and the atheists tend to be more erudite when they do start jousting see no reason why they should be any more strongly criticized than their counterparts who imo don catch nearly enough criticism for their jousting gt it the lack of balance and at least the pretense of gt objectivity in these matters that is frustrating funny see lack of balance in these matters going exactly the opposite way tend to agree with dawkins that religion gets let off much more easily than any other comparable philosophical point of view including atheism edit okay in fairness pat robertson isn only anti atheism ll admit he more like anti everybody who isn pat robertson but he definitely quite venomously anti atheism in amongst the rest of his assorted hatred too
is it just me or does steve seem little off his game today
can think of two useful beliefs espouse that contradict yours believe that the scientific method can be used to decide great many facts of the opinion that there are class of real facts for which the scientific method is inadequate my hope is that in the future the line between the two will become clear enough that the theologians can reclaim what is theirs and possibly look after this body of knowledge with some rigor also believe that all people believe themselves to be acting in good faith doing the right thing nearly all the time as much as dawkins typical atheistic tone makes my blood boil can put myself in his position and appreciate where he is coming from think he getting an unearned easy pass right now though it easy to point accusing fingers at religion right now and get modded up hundreds of points it fact that gen and gen demographic groups tend to be suspicious of institutions cast religion as evil instutution and dawkins can just ride the wave and huge number of viewers will natually assume he is right just as there are stand out atrocities to tar the name of religion there are stand out atrocities committed by governments devoid of supposed religious influence just as there are stand out examples of human care and kindness due to religion maybe you can find me some examples those brought about by communisim in the long run expect that religion as dawkins accuses of being the root of all evil will be found to be either red herring or statistially deterrent to evil he doesn seem willing to consider that right now wrapped up in an emotional response to lot of anecdotes

think the syntax argument is pretty much crap why is it good thing that xml treats any non angle bracket ampersand as regular text beyond that it does use standard human characters as markup in using the equals sign to assign data to an attribute and quotation marks to encapsulate that data the redundancy argument also is problem as generally both styles will require the assistance of program to consistently detect the problem while writing will agree that explicit closing tags make error checking easier but that could be added to expressions as well the documentation for lisp was written in latex as that was the most portable method of conveying it that people who did not already have lisp had the only decent argument in this whole article is the one he makes at the end xml helped create lot of tools for its own manipulation and in the end learning those tools is probably easier than learning lisp the reason that it is better for the problem domain is that individual concepts are easier to learn than all of lisp and the tools to work with it have already been made and are widely in use

kind of weak argument basically stating that apple will eventually lose out because people will move on from mp players as focus to mp playing software then want to make their own choices imo mp players are gadgets not platforms pc is platform it does lot of things which is why people want lots of choices in what to do with it an mp players or media player if you stretch it to video pics plays mp there is no platform just like most people could care less about operational modes and extra capabilities in their toaster they won be too demanding of their mp systems apple real big challenge is to find something else to drive lasting sales after the ipod fad dies it will all fads do

actually you re wrong all of the world population believed that the sun revolved around the earth because that what it looks like is going on the astronomers who entertained the heliocentric idea were laughed at because so few things make sense in that context if we were moving wouldn we feel it if the earth isn in special place why do we fall toward it and not the sun or the moon or jupiter if the earth is moving and the sun is stationary what keeps them together if you posit an each to each gravitational scheme you then have to explain why all the matter in the solar system doesn fall together into one big glob and that takes real sophistication intuitive understanding of dynamic equillibria and the calculus to justify it it took another years after newton to refine the model and uncover evidence to support it be really surprised if anyone here is qualified to say the earth revolves around the sun and the fact that there are such people whose knowledge eventually filtered down to our teachers doesn change the fact that we as individuals like our superstitious ancestors base our belief in heliocentric universe on an argument from authority we happen to be right but then that what the priests and holy books said too so you might want to be little less judgemental because we ll all look pretty silly in retrospect
the powerbook name existed before the powerpc architecture existed the first powerbook the powerbook was actually moto machine as were many after it think the rebranding is silly the powerbook was really great brand much like the thinkpad and macbook pro is just dumb name of course all whining aside really want one and god bless them for the power connector thing anybody with kids have three and laptop have two is gonna be in love with the idea

boring
with due respect sir the word is there were atheists around spelling the word in that fashion long before darwin and wallace and we surely would still be around if neither of them had ever lived evolution is no cornerstone of atheistic philosophy no matter what dawkins may think and the thing about talkorigins is not their objectivity though note they link to rather more of their opponents than bother linking back to them but rather that they peer reviewed references_ and explain the mainstream scientific point of view which they unashamedly present is mainstream and considered credible they back up their positions with evidence and logic not faith alone it is really not matter of belief in the religious sense at all it makes as much sense to say you believe in evolution as to say you believe in newton theory of gravity both are scientific theories that explain the observed facts and make predictions we can test which have stood up to testing very well for very long time both of them could be disproven if sufficiently weighty facts were found that didn fit into their explanations and predictions and newton theory has been to an extent by einstein but by and large that just hasn happened despite centuries of testing neither of them explain everything in fact both of them leave quite bit unexplained but each of them explain lot of things that no competing rival theory gets close to settling religion simply doesn play in this league at all think it would be fair to say that this isn what religion is hugh ross may be trying to find the best explanations for life as we know it but if so he would be well advised to listen to the experts in that field biologists like say dawkins ross is an astronomer after all one does not ask one car mechanic for advice on dentistry no matter how skilled or highly educated the mechanic may be

excellent point about orthodoxy
the rhetoric that christianity has no supporting evidence or christians are delusional really just gets old only christian because decided wasn just going to believe in feelings but if was to have faith it would be rational one did plenty of study on the historics of christianity and other related fields and think there is plenty of evidence to support it now sure can explain how everything happened or works but no one can that part of the fun of living
awesome let launch crusade against christ teaching love your neighbor as yourself that ll get em good the problem with people like dawkins is they refuse to realize that there is difference between people who call themselves christians but act completely contrary to the label they give themselves and true christians who actually follow what christ taught dawkins decides that because some people used god name to do evil things god himself speaking figuratively here is evil that just horrible way to look at things not going to sit here and pick and choose single atheist who killed someone and say hey atheists are all evil so why should dawkins do the same oh forgot its easier to make money when you are controversial

don think solid statistical objection to the evolution of man is likely let me explain there are two seperate concepts being mixed up here that evolution happened and how evolution works that evolution happened is fairly well established as for how it happens we ve figured out many mechanisms responsible genetic drift natural selection sexual selection etc and these may fully explain the phenomena however if it could be shown that there was solid statistical problem with the timeframe of the evolution of higher life forms then that would be evidence of more mechanisms at work yet to be uncovered sure one of the extra mechanisms could be an interventionist god but jumping to this conclusion immediately would be premature given how much has been discovered since darwin time thanks to growning understanding of genetics it wouldn be evidence against evolution in the sense that jurassic rabbit fossiles would be however you ll have to be bit more specific because the only statistical arguments ve encountered have been dishonest strawman constructions and sophestry imagine genuine research into the area which sure exists is interesting tho the discovery of genes that control genes may break some assumptions in older statistical research
one of the things that bugs me about javascript is that the for in syntax applies to objects but not to arrays for which you still need to use the tired for lt array length unless there better way otherwise javascript is strikingly similar to lua both are good general purpose languages and they both have table constructors the operator in both languages except javascript confusingly also uses for code blocks can think of any other language that has this feature at least as something you can do at any point in the code

not to stir the pot but there even contingent that criticizes the current system of acentrism the idea is that the current model is barely tenable and really only because of einstein relativity should that ever fall the evidence for modified tychonic geocentrism is just as strong as that for modern acentrism or so the thought goes strong arguments are used with backing from early th century contemporaries to einstein

because think the actions make the man and in the case of muhammad you see him spreading his religion by the sword become fantastically wealthy and marry many many women he gained much by his exploits he also seems very double minded there is story in the hadith about how muhammad was tricked by satan and had to have someone else call him out on it and then he made the right ruling if muhammad was tricked by satan once how do you know he wasn tricked the entire time joeseph smith was even worse this is man who destroyed printing press because they said negative things about him this is man who said that the american government would be destroyed by the wrath of god still standing btw this is man who married many many women including women that already were married he like muhammad became extremely wealthy joseph smith had prophecy after prophecy that ended up being completely false several of the original men who swore that they saw the golden tablets the book of mormon was translated on later ended up recanting their story not only that but the book of mormon has absolutely no historical or archaelogical backing this is not the case at all with the bible actually the stories of muhammad and joseph smith are eerily similar when you do some study on the two but the look at christ actions he never gained anything by what he preached he didn become weathly he didn marry many women he didn try to overthrow the government or start wars he much like the bible says was led like lamb to the slaughter also see many ot prophecies concerning christ that are very specific and fit his character exactly for example and will pour out on the house of david and the inhabitants of jerusalem spirit of grace and supplication they will look on me the one they have pierced and they will mourn for him zechariah keep in mind this is written at least years before christ and is written by jew in society that was so scared of idolatry that they wouldn even say his name much less ascribe to him any kind of physical form yet this piercing of god very much fits the image of christ anyway to make long story short christ practiced what he preached to love the lord your god with all your heart and to love your neigbhor as yourself he didn have anything to gain infact he gave everything for his message muhammad and js gained many worldy pleasures for what they did also think that something that isolates christianity from other religions is it is the only religion that teaches salvation by faith as opposed to salvation by works whether it be mormonism or buddhism every other religion except christianity teaches that to reach god or heaven or nirvana you must be good person you must do good things christianity teaches that no number of good deeds will get you into heaven only through faith in jesus christ will you get into heaven only through putting your trust in him that is the entirety of the gospel and what sets it apart from the messages of other religions
just how inflammable are mice or to assume that the mouse lit candle and carried it into the into the house
dawkins mission is clear to influence culture away from religious belief feel that for the sake of those sitting on the fence atheists have to make stand and state clearly that religion is just not acceptable that is what he is doing
note that he isn slagging all software research just systems software which he defines systems to be operating systems networking languages the things that connect programs together thus if the advances are in other areas then systems software research is irrelevant and it proves his point would also argue that the innovation in web services has come from industry and not from research labs thus that also proves his point
wish waited weeks before getting my mac
okay ll spell it out paragraph believe in christ because believe in the life death and resurrection of jesus there is just no good proof of any of these three so this is begging the question paragraph science should not talk of religion because religion belongs to another realm sorry the scientific method is not that easily escaped paragraph atheists think science explains the origins of life but it doesn we know of it and if you knew but of that you would be in awe at the beauty of the universe instead of clinging to first century creation myths

gt paragraph believe in christ because believe in the life death and resurrection of jesus there is just no good proof of any of these three so this is begging the question well if you don consider the nt which has been shown to be an accurate historical record sure gt paragraph science should not talk of religion because religion belongs to another realm sorry the scientific method is not that easily escaped no he very right science cannot reach outside of time and space and if god does exist he exists in some realm outside of time and space currently science doesn have any influence in those areas gt paragraph atheists think science explains the origins of life but it doesn we know of it and if you knew but of that you would be in awe at the beauty of the universe instead of clinging to first century creation myths see the beauty of the universe too just think that beauty is due to god gt feel that for the sake of those sitting on the fence atheists have to make stand and state clearly that religion is just not acceptable that is what he is doing right because christ was moron for teaching love your neighbor as yourself what was he thinking absolutely unacceptable

bitches belong in my kitchen you best pay attention to that also that is totally appropriate paul graham quoatation in this context
islam no islam considers jesus to be of rank no higher than prophet when there is the slight problem of centuries of christian scholars evidence and catholic institutions in advance of mohammed objecting to the contrary additionally there is rarely doctrinal center to islamic belief frequently you will find recent islamic scholars effectively reversing early fundamental islamic philosophical belief when it becomes glaringly deficient predestination immediately comes to mind joseph smith no the polygamy issue alone is probably enough to place the entire faith in doubt joseph smith claimed polygamy to be directive from god and yet he also embraced jesus and christian scripture who condemned such notions true mormonism has publicly officially reversed their doctrine on polygamy but like mohammed amp islam it complete ly discredits religion when the modern doctrinal observations contradict earlier beliefs of the same religion
what make sales decline more rapidly than ever nah the riaa has nothing on the draconian ways of the publishing industry computers are still almost foreign objects to them and talking as business tools here often small book stores still have to submit orders to distributers and publishers by typed letter of course maybe apress will turn it around if they start broadening their market focus

lt quote gt you can look big problem too directly in the eye you have to approach it somewhat obliquely but you have to adjust the angle just right you have to be facing the big problem directly enough that you catch some of the excitement radiating from it but not so much that it paralyzes you you can tighten the angle once you get going just as sailboat can sail closer to the wind once it gets underway lt quote gt what the hell does this even mean how do you look at problem obliquely big fan of most of what graham writes and there is nothing wrong with being abstract but this is little too far maybe his next essay could be how to look at problems like sailboat and explain how you do this
the reason its pile on of one sided debates is that it is objective the science all points in that direction ve spent ton of time trying to find some insightful and interesting objections to evolution in the hope of better understanding it and found absolutely nothing from the creationist camps there more productive debate about evolution from evolutionary biologists the evolution development camp and ecology than from the past years of creationist work
just want to correct that according to many books about him mohammed was not rich man and he was even very poor person he finished all his first wife money for telling his religion he married to women most of them were old and widow why not young and beautiful girls he married them because he had to teach his religion to women by using his wifes many of his teachings and principals called sunnah was firstly learnt and spreaded by this women also if he says that satan tried to trick him once does not it show that he was aware of what comes from satan and what comes from the god and god helps him also he always praised christ and he did not say anthing bad about him all his followers loved and others as prophet so how can we think that he did all these for his benefits he is poor married to widows fought and wounded to protect his country and his religion do not think that he made them just for his pleasure what told here are what the history says about him and why people me too believe him sorry for my english

well certainly hope no one tries to attack that quote as being inappropriate after all if you made graph representing which of these words occurred together think you find the central node was the one representing inappropriate that seems the most general and thus least meaningful label at the moment as far as can tell it is little more than five syllable synonym for bad paul graham http www paulgraham com labels html think we should call this sport graham pong

he was known as el emin which means trustworthy in his language before prophethood and even his enemies were using this name after his prohethood they could not bear him and they fought with him mohammed suffered hunger and prosecution for many years after prophethood he was rich before that arabians were the most cruel people of that time they were even burying their doughters because it was shame for them and he taught these people moral values he had the worst people of the time and made them the best morally and technically people of that time even his enemies became his followers many people came to kill him but returned in his side as many historicians say europe learnt many things from muslims in the medivial age do not know any other man in the history having these properties this is what makes difference between him and the other arabian warlords please read his life from book which has good reputation in the world suggest the book written by salih suruc please google it

one correction fairly certain there no historical record of the resurrection of jesus and that this biggest part of christianity should be taken on faith alone not saying that with critical connotations if one is going to be religious humble faith is important to have also regarding your last statement the basis for rejecting religion isn because of the cool things that jesus said most of the atheists know have moral philosophy remarkably like jesus as love your neighbor as yourself is great basis to an ethical system what is objectionable however is all the religious and social claptrap that has built up in the past years religion that leads to wars hatred judging one neighbor and affronts to human dignity such as god hates fags http www godhatesfags com humans of course will do these things with or without religion but armed with the arrogance of being right know that god wants me to do people do much worse things than they would otherwise suicide bombers one might expect that religion might make also make people do more good than they would otherwise but in my personal experience and this is of course just anecdoctal those who are doing the greatest good in the world working with the poor disadvantaged and the downtrodden and in the process eschewing personal wealth and comfort are uniformly not religious guessing your personal experience is different that the people you know that exude fundamental decency are religious basically atheists like dawkins think that religion is holding back our society by encouraging more crime more hate and more bad feelings and in general more immorality and judging by some limited data in the real world they might be right http reddit com info id

allow me to differ you don like the way this conversation is going but it is conversation despite your efforts to derail it care not one whit whether you are in fact christian or of any other faith you have made three statements in your original post that are worthy of rebuttal in paragraph you state the basis for intelligent christian thought is the belief in the life death and resurrection of jesus as recorded in the gospels which form historical rather than mystical basis do not appreciate those who represent christianity as an arbitrary blind belief either by those who believe it or those who do not more succinctly state that christianity is not blind belief because it is rooted in history hope it is clear that this is patently absurd statement to make the belief in the historical reality of the gospels is but plaster on wooden leg convenient but hollow excuse to make it acceptable to believe but it is still circular reasoning because the historical reality of the gospels is far from being accepted in mainstream science would you like to talk about this bit first or shall go on to demolish the rest of your post

how about you look around before you make such claims you or anyone but hand full of people will never work on this project anyway id say the problem that freenet the most notorious example had with this was caused by several factors its performance was so terrible that only those doing the most elicit things bothered to stick around the size of these files usually small pictures was optimal for freenet there just aren that many files out there these days there was culture that celebrated the idea of being totally freed from all censorship by human nature this intrigued many people who then began out of curiosity to test the limits and see if such thing is really possible by itself on the other hand can be very poor for one to many distribution of dangerous content over long period of time simple attack would be incrementally dos or otherwise interrupt known blocks of suspected ip addresses and watching for the server in question to go offline in this will be effectively solved by layering dht system perhaps freenet on top of mixnet like but digress all in all think the most advanced networks have contributed very little to the spread of cp against it as much as the next guy but this age old argument has been proving untrue if your really interested in trying to stop cp how about you go after usenet good luck with that one
answered your question earlier with the statement christianity is salvation from faith any other religion including buddhism is salvation by works still trying to find out why christianity is unique like that it only helps that see god working all the time don mean that in vague way mean that ve known year in advance the exact date something was going to happen that certainly never happened to me before became christian
this stuff about oh child pornographers will use it therefore can bear it seems irrational to me the whole internet is benefitting child pornographers banking credit cards digital cameras hard drives solid state storage devices etc are of great benefit to child pornographers does this mean we should outlaw and refuse to cooperate with that stuff well if you ask me the answer is clearly no freedom of speech means when it means anything freedom of speech you don like
was going to let this slide but don want python misrepresented to someone looking to use it gil doesn matter on unithread systems whatsoever the vast majority of systems fall into this category therefore since thread concurrency isn used in most systems there must be another reason what reason threads are concurrency abstraction no let me modify that good concurrency abstraction especially when waiting for io threads are an elegant solution granted not the only the gil is not feature of python stackless as pointed out doesn even have the gil the gil is an implementation feature in other words get new vm without the gil and you don have to worry about it currently there are major implementations of pyhton without the gil stackless ironpython and jython there also one experimental implementation without the gil pypy so in other words if someone tells you that python is crippled by lack of true threading they re just slandering the language

its because open source software uses editors like emacs which have auto indenting the corporate guys write their code in some inferior editor probably wordpad and are too lazy to keep hitting the space bar times tabs are just bad for language were scoping is defined by whitespace tab could be indented by any range of ammounts depending on the editor your using

not sure what you mean about there being no evidence of the resurrection the gospels viewed historically indicate that jesus went through the process of roman crucifixion and was therefore not only merely dead but really most sincerely dead he was then identified alive by many of his followers so he claimed he would rise from the dead he died and he was seen alive according to the major accounts the simplest interpretation is that he rose from the dead the skepticism of science of this point is irrelevant in discussion of historical evidence

in languages with lighter weight objects javascript packaging up state in an object becomes simple but these languages tend to already have closures so this technique doesn buy the programmer any convenience when dealing with abstractions it works best to say what you mean if you mean this function is closed over this bit of state you should guarantee that statement even when using objects doing so requires the programmer to think about exactly what state they want to close over so he can put it into instance variables for example closures remove this burden

yes understand and agree with your statement but unless am mistaken reddit is not advertised as software science community slashdot personally have been hoping that as the site becomes more popular the community would begin to lessen its preference for software science articles furthermore was hoping that the founders owners would make an effort to support that lessening of the current preference or at the very least accomodate multiple communities

no one is trying to work out skeptically whether george washington existed murphy law let me rephrase that no one sane is trying to work out critically and skeptically whether george washington existed this is because there is giant body of evidence suggesting his existence and little or none contradicting it give that only as an example of the basis of inductive logic more evidence is more certainty mean for the word evidence to include the issues of reliability directness perception of witnesses et cetera until get home and can poke around my bookshelf for bibliographies and screw around on the internet for awhile only have hearsay so my hearsay is that evidence about the life of jesus is stronger by several orders than that for any other ancient event need few books that don have with me to point me to sources you could search some academic source for studies of ancient manuscripts of the gospels and other ancient documents if you are interested
first the brain is neural network it may not be exhaustively or even accurately described by the artificial neural nets constructed by scientists and engineers but it is unequivocally network of neurons the observation that scientists metaphors for the mind brain often reflect current technology is valid however scientists know or are supposed to know that their models theories are wrong and or incomplete that why the constant goal is to test the assumptions or predictions of those models and theories pointing out that metaphors of mind follow trends does nothing substantive to invalidate those metaphors some metaphors are revealed to be less appropriate than others through empirical work but that just means that the metaphors and the related theories are being appropriately tested that scientist job the work described in the article is more about cognition the computations being performed than the brain itself anyway think what griffiths and tenebaum really show is that peoples mental models learning and decision making appear to make use of bayesian computations or structured mental representations that bear some likeness to bayesian networks this isn terribly surprising to the extent that conditional probabilities accurately describe the world and to the extent that one believes the mind is well adapted to understand and reason about the world there should be link between the math and the cognition
the most chilling argument in the piece this is by the way the textbook definition of terrorism attacking civilian population to get it to withdraw support from the enemy what this strategic orientation applied wherever american troops fight the iraqi resistance represents is an embrace of terrorism as principle tactic for subduing iraq insurgency
ve read tmmm and no silver bullets and have to say something about them there is silver bullet it is so obvious to the intelligent writers on the subject that they would not think to mention it it does not apply at the project level so it is untouched by project management and any discussion of methodologies the silver bullet is the application of individual differences in programmers to hiring the fact that there are huge individual differences in programmer productivity was discovered or rather well documented in the late the issue itself is popular one with people joel spolsky and paul graham and huge number of other people talking about dumb schools vs smart schools and how to find keep and pleasure brilliant hackers and so forth ve never heard anyone call it silver bullet or order of magnitude gain in productivity but it is

first whether or not non belief in god may have desireable or undesireable implications or outcomes is more or less irrelevent to god existance or lack theirof second looks like you re also bringing in the god absolute morality thing which have trouble with see four possibilities god exists and there is such thing as absolute morality god exists and there is no such thing as absolute morality god doesn exist and there is such thing as absolute morality god doesn exist and there is no such thing as absolute morality you seem to claim that only the first and last options are possible ie that morality is simply whatever god says to do but then could say what obligates me to do what god says ie you have to assume some sort of absolute morality anyways that implies concept of doing what god says being good thing tm but then it no longer seems unreasonable that lack of god would directly imply lack of an absolute morality now whether or not an absolute morality exists is not what arguing here merely that the existance or not of one is not identical to the question of the existance or not of god
never claimed that mere precedence establishes truth only that the sheer weight of precedence provides compelling argument that cannot be summarily dismissed by fiat your comparison to geocentrism is faulty because the claim of geocentrism was based on observations the sun goes around the earth heliocentrists and acentrists do not deny this observation mohammed claims were different christ did not say the things you said he said so your claims to truth are in error for islam the burden is upon mohammed to explain how the phenomena of christianity that progressed over the centuries and existed in his day was in complete error on so fundamental an issue there was an established body of christian doctrine christian institutions gospel fragements copies of christian scripture meticulously maintained and writings of early church fathers which all apparently made this error mohammed answer that they were in error was divinely revealed to me and no do not have additional evidence to support this claim
if you watch the video at the end you ll notice that the demonstration avoids showing to us that the lock was closed and secure before they started picking it with their cool tool infact it looks like the guy is holding it closed with his finger anyway it amusing not sure that gillette would approve even though he uses duracell battery
on the contrary the free market is the best way to ensure that water is shared as equally and effectively as possible in many places in africa water is run by the government the result is that the rich and politically influential get water pipelines and cheap water while the poor end up paying many times more to people who cart the water to more remote areas since the government does not have the incentive to run pipelines there africa is mess of government run and privatized meaning that the government grants monopoly to particular company and still doesn stop messing around in the market water services you ll hear people throwing around the word privatization when the actual situation is anything but free market places with truly free markets in water don have shortages governments need to be needed so they ll take any excuse to show people how they are needed they ll do everything they can to mess up water services then say they tried privatization and it failed so obviously only the government can provide water
these people must be crazy because only crazy person would think thumbs up down system could equal fact checking digg and reddit are about groupthink what the group thinks is interesting reading story about about stolen digg css is inherently interesting to digg users so is story about that story being lie both made the front page yay the system works
getting really sick of digg today there is link about guys who took someone else modded xbox maps and is trying to sell them okay that lame but the digg community has taken upon itself to invade the guys forums post comments like blew my load on your face you fag and even to post his whois information in personal info digg has done this times within the past month don care if someone has done wrong this immature mob vigilante justice that digg apparently think it has mission to commit is just ridiculous really its just sickening and the crew at digg doesn seem to care to stop it
with you his code was simpler before he even factored out the helper function maybe there are better examples in real programming projects where closures actually let you write less code or structure it in more useful manner this example is silly
ok that makes excellent sense thanks don have any real evidence at hand either but the hearsay that vaguely remembered claimed there was no really solid historical evidence for jesus of nazareth historicity and that what there was had been questioned as possibly later day medieval fabrications my hearsay could easily be wrong though as no historian

this is why disregard the popular anti christian sites on the subject none of them that have seen approaches the issue of reliability of given idea or record history like web design is not magic trick the book that that have in mind is the case for christ so if come up with any references later they will probably come from that book or similar source
so it is possible to submit url with misleading title and effectively blocking it from getting better description from anyone else
gt this example is silly agree most examples meant to show off language features are silly writing an example that is both simple enough for wide audience to understand and powerful enough to warrant attention is hard task does anyone have any examples
bayesian is very very vague term and this article isn talking about bayesian networks prefer the more general term graphical models or bayesian spam filtering but rather mode of logic that people use in everyday thinking thus the better comparison would be not to neural nets but to propositional logic which think we can agree doesn happen very often in people unless they ve had lots of training my favorite text on bayesian reasoning is the jaynes book http www amazon com asin still less than convinced by the representation of the data in this article secondly the article isn even published yet to allow anyone to review it thirdly suspicious of any researcher that talks to the press before their data is published so in short the economist really shouldn have published this and should have waited yet another example of atrocious science reporting
perhaps you should research justice in iran paying attention to things like gay teens and the rights of women try if you would to seperate your distaste for america justice system from your ability to comment on iran some of us are willing to be outraged at both without mindless moral equivication

my hearsay is that evidence about the life of jesus is stronger by several orders than that for any other ancient event no that is not the case julius caesar who lived until bc and for whose life we have pretty complete picture from his own writings as well as from contemporaries several orders more than for jesus like have said before on another thread christ did not create the religion he was created by it think the god like events in christ life have been lifted and assembled from previously existing mythologies why if may conjecture would say because it suited the early christians to create this myth for their religious teachings after all ron hubbard did it for scientology just couple of decades ago

said that they have been criticized for over stating battery life before the thing is you can get hours out of powerbook or any other laptop with similar specs and battery if you re absolutely obsessive about conditioning it properly not leaving it plugged in at full charge and so on but that not realistic which is probably why they ve not bothered mentioning battery life at all and yes you re right that the macbook probably will have about the same battery life as other core duo systems did say otherwise no also it worth noting that other core duo systems might have larger or smaller batteries anandtech recently covered one that had hours and one that had hours
from the article western countries fear iran nuclear programme could be used to make atomic bombs but tehran denies this saying it wants to produce energy only isn iran swimming in oil why do they need nuclear power plants guess they re full of it
its obviously not the death sentence which outrages people but rather the crime for which this sentence is handed out
nazanin who was years old at the time of the incident said that after the three men started to throw stones at them the two girlsâ boyfriends quickly escaped on their motorbikes leaving the pair helpless yeah great boyfriends they were
what did say that is so contentious are you suggesting that the battery life will be particularly poor if so then why there is nothing about the macbook pro hardware that is that different from any other core duo notebook and they have been shown to have average to exceptional battery life already

am missing something here the flow rate is determined by the cross sectional area of the pipe and the pressure head does it not what does the number of shower heads have to do with it also water is scarce resource anarchist ranting against the evils of government is not the smartest strategy

hate tab characters because if you use them you are contending that the width of the tab doesn matter and of the time it actually does when am given file that uses tabs for indenting times out of can deduce what the tab width the author used was since the file looks crappy with any other tab width the usual culprits are inconsistent use of tabs vs spaces to indent and columns that line up somewhere else to the right of where the lines start comments but only line up correctly if the indentation is particular amount
water is not scarce resource it is recycled and pumped back through the system your shower head has flow restrictor that decreases its output by removing this you can increase the flow of water by as much as laying back while the government sticks its large obtrusive finger into every orifice of your life is not smart being aware of the finger and attempting to avoid its brown probing end is better course of action unless you like that sort of thing if that is the case enjoy your probing and low flow shower heads
am illustrating the point that on many of these sites users slowly gain false sense of privacy from people other than their friends now many schools not being as bound by laws as other organizations are beginning to search through these sites they are monitoring private communication among the students even regardless of whether it occurred on school grounds many are getting slammed for posting anything offensive at all with the site alarming privacy policy and heavy involvement of non advertiser data miners third parties reading your email is entirely possible or thatâ what thought when read this what everyone else think
and here thought it was some interesting article about looking away from the education system to start thinking learning
the manufacturers are required to install the restrictors it is illegal for them to leave the restrictors out but many shower heads ship with instructions on removing the device the author fixation is that public officials feel it is necessary to monitor and control the flow rate of our showers to appease ignorant voters

the article is cited as in press which in academic publishing means that it has been refereed by several people in addition to an editor and accepted for publication on an academic cv the paper is consider published the lag time on journal publications can be as long as year after acceptance while am with you in wondering who initiated the contact between the media and the researchers most likely public relations official at brown or mit don think you ll find that there are serious flaws in the basic methods or reasoning of the paper you may disagree with the conclusions but you should read the paper http cog brown edu gruffydd papers predictions pdf to make your decision

actually the bayesian model they use here is pretty similar to those used in many bayesian spam filtering ones though it is continuous not discrete and only deals with estimating single conditional probability the details are in their appendix not sure understand why you think it has to do with propositional logic also not sure why neural networks are being discussed here that seems orthogonal to the issues being talked about indeed bayesian methods can be applied to neural networks as well see ftp ftp sas com pub neural faq html a_bayes and some argue that neural nets are special case of more general bayesian framework however uncleoxidant point is well taken putting bayesian in the title of your paper nowadays seems to vastly increase its chance of publication and it appears of getting reported on

agree with you that it seems obvious there should be link between math and cognition but there lot of evidence that people are biased and have difficulty estimating likelihoods kahneman amp tversky work on heuristics and biases think the cool thing here is just how closely people predictions match the ideal
pr piece fed to the press

ll certainly concede that the sexy jargon factor gets into science publishing no argument there but the work these guys are doing and ve spoken to both authors at conferences is certainly well connected to bayes just thought uncleoxidant point was bit dismissive apologies for the broken link in my other post it fixed
kahneman and tversky have certainly shown that people do not always reason optimally rationally griffiths and tenenbaum are addressing somewhat different set of phenomena dislike both extremes on this issue it tempting to say people are morons and also people are brilliant people reason differently in different contexts that said also think it neat that people get close to optimal sometimes

that would not be the science that am familiar with firstly no is needed to be convinced that there is no whispy dragon in the garage we do not need belief to bridge gap in our knowledge here just our common sense understanding of the world is enough we go into that garage many times week and never see dragon we know nobody has in fact ever seen one in the wild let alone in his garage etc we have no positive proof but we do have an overwhelming amount of negative proof it would run against all our other knowledge of the world to have whispy dragon in the garage thus can safely and scientifically say that there is no dragon in the garage ah but there might be one now you might say there might be but what are the odds would have to say that the odds are approximately equal to the existence of bad breadthed bogeyman under your bed you made it up it has no basis in reality so until you show me some whispy dragon excrement or nice picture of it sleeping in the corner will believe think be convinced of is better expression in the non existence of whispy dragons in the garage the exact same applies to god in the theistic sense to remain on the fence think shows not an adherence to science but rather shows you haven really thought it through

this is interesting although the phrase only because of relativity makes me nervous probably just not inflecting it right in my head or something can you provide some information on this
the cross sectional area in question is roughly that of the holes in the shower head more heads gt more area gt greater flow for given head its not the cross section of eg the shower stem pipe assuming the flow restrictor is in the head the overall flow resistance of three resistors in parallel is less than just one too can refer you to some physics tutors that are quite good if you like to learn some

one of my phil professors had an interesting take on this argument lot of us were atheists or agnostics closeted atheists and most of us thought we had come by our un beliefs by abandoning our preconceptions or some such so he said suppose that over the course of few weeks this spring groups of physicists working at different universities successfully prove that the universe was created by group of entities that the press has taken to calling the big bangers astronomical work to identify instances of their intervention in the movements of certain star clusters is proceeding rapidly and some researchers have begun to speculate about the possibility of talking to them now suppose that you ve been out hiking on the appalachian trail for the last two months so you learn about this all at once when you stop for gas on the drive home how does all this make you feel the story illustrates couple of points belief in god is not inherently unscientific it is unsupported by everything we know but the existence of an agentive purposeful creator of the universe hasn been disproven either as corollary there are some elements of faith in atheism but you need pretty far fetched example to shake that faith it not correct to say that religion and science are about two different things the truth belief dichotomy because people won place their faith in something they know to be untrue monotheists in our story would be in for an interesting ride it is correct that knowledge can be put to use in different ways and that most people are interested in scientific knowledge in only very cursory way devout lutheran real estate developer in minnesota for example might find ways to reconcile the polytheistic revelation with his faith no god before me gt existence of other gods and go on living the same way as before he be able to do this because his fundamental place in the world wouldn have changed much lapsed hindu physicist on the other hand would have her professional and personal worlds turned upside down besides the implications for physics she might feel the need to make all kinds of changes to her life after thinking about what it all means despite the fact that she already knows as hindu that the universe is basically ageless and is populated by many gods my apologies to any hindus out there if ve gotten this all wrong

asked the developer some questions via email here they are along with his responses you ve kindly made xtend available for download but will it work on my win sp box with net think so haven tried so can be sure but it should work will it have significant cost in terms of overall performance not really it is essentially just database of urls and links between urls it is quite simple under the hood if install it will it destroy my current folder hierarchy no it is very unobtrusive assume that files are still saved in folder somewhere under the hood as it were will they still be accessible without using the xtend interface yes you can get hold of all the files you create directly in xtend or move to xtend as your repository is simply folder with lots of subfolders containing the actual files if you are worried you can link your documents with xtend instead of moving them and they will stay in the same place as where you created them does xtend replace explorer completely or just the search tool ideally you use it instead of explorer when working with documents but it doesn completely replace explorer for things like working with system files it shame this product was so ahead of it time perhaps if you open sourced it and put it on sourceforge more people would use it and development could continue unfortunately the code is bit spaghetti like and am not exactly proud of it had junior programmer working for me and the time and got him to do most of the coding so to be made open source it would need fair amount of work first

disagree with your africa example if the water market had been privatized there the only thing that would change is that the rich would propably be paying more for their water which is good thing but it still would not be profitable to deliver water to the poor because the cost of water transportation to certain region increases exponentially to the the ammount of water transported because there is not that much water in africa so it has to be imported from far away this problem is neither solvable by governments nor by free water market as long as the economy is so weak which of course partly results from lack of free market paired with corruption which is sadly bit of catch
it is in way if society has certain usage of water day this water has to be provided and therefore since water is finite it is not usable by anyone else

that is hardly evidence might suggest that the relationship of personality to brain is quite similar to that of software to hardware in which case it is perfectly conceivable that when our hardware is no longer functional our software could be held elsewhere until such time as we receive new hardware on the resurrection view or immediately transferred to new hardware on the reincarnation view now is what ve just stated scientifically demonstrable no but it not scientifically demonstrable that it not true either which is my point to give him the benefit of the doubt perhaps dawkins misspoke and meant to say that there is no evidence of the type he is willing to accept of there being an afterlife that quite different statement than to say that there is actually evidence against there being an afterlife

disappointing while glad someone tried summarizing it really doubt anyone will gain lot of benefit from reading that outline the original fills page after page with examples examples illustrate why you should never criticize always listen to people and keep your mouth shut when they are talking from examples you realize that every moment you listen to that person even if they are blathering on about nonsense you are gaining thier trust people tend to retain far more from anecdotal examples than bullet points even if the bullet points are spot on accurate summaries brains don remember that stuff they remember the stories behind them stories build bridges between the reality live in and those bullet points read the book after hundreds of pages of examples could see that getting people to act is an art could master with practice with this mastery comes the ability to accomplish incredible things the outlines while sure they give person leg up fall woefully short of the grand theme of understanding people it that theme that made the book the amazing piece of research and explanation that it was that said love to be wrong editorialists of the world please read this read this and realize you can accomplish more by disposing of the venom maybe even read the book should really be writing this in my own weblog

perhaps but it one thing to say believing in the ipu makes no scientific sense and it quite another to say there is evidence that the ipu doesn exist there is no evidence one way or the other regarding the ipu so regarding the ipu one could with justification say there is no evidence supporting the existence of the ipu there is no evidence for the existence of the ipu one could then make an argument based on do not proliferate entities unnecessarily that belief in the ipu is unjustified however this is not called evidence this is philosophical argument not scientific evidence per se note that to make this argument one must also argue that the ipu is an unnecessary entity please note that am not right now arguing for the rationality of believing in an afterlife am merely objecting to the implication on dawkins part that there is evidence against there being an afterlife

there are several caveats to this paper first methane is minor greenhouse gas compared with co second the authors do not claim at all that the methane content of the atmosphere needs to be revised they simply found that living plants produce methane by cultivating plants under bell jar and irradiating them to preclude the possibility of bacteria contaminating the measurement the political aim here if there is one is rather to undermine the notion of planting trees to act as carbon sink finally it is interesting that levels of methane were very temperature sensitive with concentrations approximately doubling with every degrees centigrade rise in temperature in range between degrees centigrade and degrees centigrade if that the case increased production of methane might be caused by global warming

wrong methane is more potent than co as greenhouse gas look it up for example from just the first link on google found http members aol com profchm gina html from that page other sources agree with it methane is the second largest contributor to global warming it is very effective greenhouse gas to times more potent than carbon dioxide over the next years methane is large contributor to global warming second only to carbon dioxide its atmospheric concentration is ppmv much less than carbon dioxide but each molecule of methane is twenty times more effective than each molecule of carbon dioxide at trapping infrared radiation mackenzie and mackenzie its large contribution to global warming is due in part to its potency in trapping heat in the earth atmosphere it is to times more potent than carbon dioxide over the next years emissions of methane have grown dramatically methane emissions from human related activities now represent about of total emissions as opposed to less than some years ago methane is not minor compared to co it highly relevant in terms of global warming probably even more important than co in the long run get your facts right before throwing out bullshit like political aims

both this article and the joel test steps to better code are just focused on project managment probably this is why it hard to get over unless you are doing some very big software excellence is reached using small team of top quality programmers ad if there is coordinator it should be one of the programmers or at least with strong programming skills bug tracking systems versions systems build in one step are all useful things but to focus on this seems like to attack the problem from the wrong side maybe this culture is the cause of top programmers being paid just bit more of bad ones the article what ve learned from failure that was in the hot list here at reddit some day ago was much more interesting reading
sweet like it

textmate supports most if not all of the emacs bindings that standard cocoa text areas do and plenty of its own what movement commands do you feel it missing agree about splitting like to see it though don have need for it very often
few may end up driving such car who aren now but fewer and fewer think if these people were given this car to drive as they normally do for few weeks and then tested again the results would prove far different the problem here was not that they were bad drivers that we know of but that they weren used to the for today peculiar handling characteristics of the test car
old news
well theoretically we could have an ai running now if we had the software for it ibm latest supercomputer using cell processors has approximately the same power as the human brain supposedly its only matter of time
actually like this story lot there an economic school of thought that says when you give people more safety features they will just drive more dangerously until they return to the same level of risk they were at previously it makes sense to me people riding motorcycles are for the most part pretty damn careful and soccer mom driving suvs don pay attention at all feel free to disagree but do give it some thought would you drive more carefully if there were giant spike protruding from your dashboard ready to impale you in crash
this book is total artwork anyone downmodding it for the wrong reason is nuts also recommended the madman by gibran and atheist hate current arab and christian zealots but real art like this should be preserved

you probably think he death penalty deters murderers look since you didn notice ll clue you in religion doesn hold back the monsters it does nothing to stop them the only people that religion affects are good people just like the laws of man criminals break the laws because they don adhere to the philosophy behind the law good people adhere to laws because they believe in them the real question is what would weak minded people do without religion why they have to invent it there is no escaping the fact that many people cannot deal with the finality of death they need something to believe in that takes the sting away from losing their loved ones and or their own self
man what load of garbage did you go to ucb do you live in berkeley did both berkeley not the university is constantly portrayed as out there by the media ve seen million times the local news making berkeley the butt of jokes because small group of people had an extreme view they painted the entire city with the same brush the fact is there is small minority of looney in berkeley watched them for years the rest the majority is normal just like any other metopolitan place so spare me the low brow prejudice please second your feeling about dawkins wanting to round people up is just that gee how ironic that you put for this evidence against him doing what you decry third so he went to church as kid wow you might get nobel for that one no one mean no one would ever do what their parents told them to do yes he must be raving hypocrite for going to church as child yessiree really it very difficult to believe you are an atheist think it clear you re religious troll
this is really quite amazing sooooo many people saying they re an atheist but then turning around and making supportive comments about religion is this from some handbook that the religious nuts hand out at church like how to argue with atheists inflitration is the key ya know it pathetic if you can be honest on mostly anonymous place like reddit com

that just why put authentic in there you see what we ve been told is extremist is actually the authentic islam the people who actually believe what their holy books say it not bunch of guys running around making up hate it what their god tells them to do the muslims who don jump on board with that action are in fact denying the very thing they profess
how about including java and php http www indeed com jobtrends lisp csmalltalk cruby chaskell cpython cjava cphp just to put things in perspective
have you considered that something like benefits scheme would get mixed up in this the database isn programming specific scheme is pretty common word in job postings relative to python lisp ruby etc
why
articles like this are fine but understand that authentic christianity and judaism are quite literally close to the same thing old testament like this as general statement about how religion unbound by reason by definition devolves into behavior like this however suspect that most news like this is distributed because people want to attack islam specifically in the us usually to further christianity or justify policy

what happened to lisp in may to june it exceeded ruby there
really good site good innovation
authentic christianity is very different from authentic islam judiasm on the other hand has historical mandates somewhat similar but of course these are superceded by the mandates of the new covenant while it foolish to state that all religions are peace loving it equally foolish to equate christianity with islam with regards to the mandate to kill others
this site is awesome
makes it nice and simple
this is like saying the grand dragon of the kentucky chapter of the klu klux klan is the authentic face of christianity don generalise the rantings of single crazy to the views of million very diverse people

html and net seem to be the highest java is up there with and the languages listed by this article originally are comparatively low
wow did you read the same article did read that what ve learned from failure one from few days ago and thought it was disjointed rather vacuous read that was pumped up extensively by arbitrary and often out of place quotes ended it having gained nothing out of the exercise this one on the other hand doesn seem intended to be piece of grand wisdom but rather questions the long repeated claim of some of the web personalities that they only hire the top or whatever that does rub lot of people the wrong way and it nice to see someone come out and call them on it on the flip side followed some of the links from this article that led to some fantastic advice that actually was very beneficial digg reddit insightful stumbled
cute but none of the funny reviews are on the amazon website is it hoax
know lot of us atheists don usually much care about religion sure it annoying when it gets in our faces but unless we live in iran it usually doesn think about it some ridiculous percentage of people in the general population here in the usa at least are religious but most of the time of them don bother us_ so clearly the cases where religion really is detrimental must be the exception to the rule bloody annoying exception but still not the rule so what if most of the folks around me believe in god let em no skin off my back unless they make it some skin off my back in which case they better run fast
it certainly good textbook but wouldn say it is the best the best textbook imo is graph theory with applications by ja bondy and usr murthy shame that one is out of print
it should be noted that the author doesn seem to know lisp very well his usage of lisp is not very idiomatic and he forgot to compile the code nevertheless nice to finally see lisp mentioned at reilly web site
love python but the title chosen by the submitter sucks the real article title is what new in python also the article claims will be released in which didn happen submitter did really bad job here that said the new generator hook looks promising

don think this is accurate for programming languages that lack distinctive name ruby or since it searches all ads for occurences of the word not just those advertising programming jobs if you compare ruby and apl http www indeed com jobtrends apl cruby for example apl seems to win which is kind of funny and if you look at the actual search hits for ruby and apl both contain fair amount of false positives so does the listings for
this should generate some good conversation anyone have more information on this gt so take say drug corporation most of the serious research and development the hard part of it is funded by the public
tried including the word programmer http www indeed com jobtrends lisp programmer csmalltalk programmer cruby programmer chaskell programmer cpython programmer to see if that changed things but overall things look pretty similar except smalltalk now look more popular this makes sense smalltalk is much more distinctive search term than ruby heres the same graph with developer instead of programmer http www indeed com jobtrends lisp developer csmalltalk developer cruby developer chaskell developer cpython developer
add net and asp to the list say this because am helping client fill position for net programmer the large corporate employers in our town are hiring them in droves driving the salaries way up this is good if you are net programmer the small net consultavies are getting killed because their programmers are leaving
and as we all know clinton never lies
there difference in lying when boxed into corner that you don think you should justly be in and say lying to support war against another country don ya think when clinton was forced into even the question the people pushing had gone waaaay over the line it should never have gotten there remember that investigation wasn about sex it was about whitewater the us found that he and mrs clinton did not lie about that go away republican troll
these kinds of tools have been available to private detectives for years and years and no to be private detective you don need licenses or training heck my dad posed as private detective when he was in college to snoop on his frat brothers and gather salacious details of their lives for public humiliation at parties so someone didn understand that of legally discoverable data is publicly available upon request they post it on their blog and pat themselves on the back for such scoop big whoop the republikkkan killuminati is not paying month to track howard dean phone calls and keep you under their jackbooted thumb while they raise taxes on everyone who doesn own learjet corporations are not making massive investments in consumer research to custom tailor usurious rates that kick in exactly when and for how long you want to call someone these are just tools for an industry that skirts just this side of the light this is an example of how community groups gather information on sex offenders living in their area because most sex offenders don self register when they move into community how credit bureaus determine if you re deadbeat or not and how legal process servers track you down to deliver patrimony suit on behalf of the illegitimate kids you ran out on this makes you sick grow up go visit darfur and abu ghraib and see some shit that will really make you sick and as an aside why is it that every time hackers discover some tool that invades some private space like oh dunno someone else code or algorithm and that owner tries to close the hole they re automatically eeeeeevil secretive bastards and we should allow people to be able to use this exploit and information just wants to be free man but as soon as some exploit pops up that invades certain other people private spaces well sheesh it huge violation of privacy and rights and dammit gov business needs to get their asses in gear to fix this for us pronto seems little like eating our cake and having it too if you want to be able to traipse through secrets uninhibited in the name of discovery and freedom of information well that includes your secrets too

chomsky relates to the basic research as the hard bit what the drug companies do is clinical research or development this is scoffed at by many but in fact is the time and resources consuming bit about medical research many tidbits of information from many patients have to be gathered and verified most of which have been collected in clinical routine that means sometimes jotted down on scraps of paper publicly funded medical research is easily dwarfed by the rod funds of the companies and clinical research in the academic field is in most instances so lowly funded it not funny

maybe the term will go away if we pretend it never existed
coroutines are like threads you use them to write straight line code where you ordinarily need state machine for instance if you want to write non blocking server which is essentially select loop you either need to write state machine when receive data and haven received then is the data and do otherwise if haven got yet then is the data and do or coroutine yield yield and then when receive data just resume the coroutine with the data if that makes any sense just woke up

this isn about socialism vs capitalism it about superstition being taught as science and it about separation of church and state free market education there plenty of private schools for rich kids poor kids need an education too either way children deserve to be taught real science in science class the religious fundamentalists can teach creationism id in church and sunday school where it belongs

gt this isn about socialism vs capitalism it about superstition being taught as science and it about separation of church and state ll preface my comment by saying that don necessarily think that id should be taught in schools however the whole separation of church and state thing is so misused that its getting tiring separation of church and state originates from letter that thomas jefferson wrote to collection of baptist ministers promising that the us government would never enact any kind of ruling that would restrict the free practice of religion in any way there is nothing or otherwise that says that christianity or any other religion cannot be involved in the government in some way infact democracy implies quite the opposite rule by the people and if the majority of people follow one religion it follows that governmental decisions will likely be influenced by that religion this is not an issue of church and state this is an issue of science and teaching science and personally have yet to see really strong science that supports creationism although have come across many interesting things in the past few years personally don think it matters whether evolution is true or not still think it is god who did the creating do not think that id needs to be taught in school unless it is taught in scientific manner id can be taught in the approach of yes there is evidence for evolution but there is also strong evidence that the complexity of life and the ridiculous amount of coincidences make it highly improbably that this all happened by accident however it shouldn be matter of popping out the bible and saying okay kids this is what id is because that isn the point of school anyway dread the comments that this whole debate will get as it is both political and religious issue and if it were just one of the two the comments would be heated enough but combine both and all hell will break loose its probably where carmack got his inspiration for doom

you said the real article title is what new in python uh the title of the link at reddit is what new in python leap into the future you also said also the article claims will be released in which didn happen submitter did really bad job here uh it not the submitter fault that the final version of python wasn released in the stuff in the article leap into the future as far as stable releases of python are concerned the submitted title is spot on the commenter did really bad job here
what bugs me most about of the criticism of rms is how he unreasonable hogwash the man picked set of principles to live by and he sticks by them it no big deal if you don admire prickly unreasonable geniuses just don delude yourself into thinking that your feelings matter especially if you can cogently argue against his philosophy the gpl or the fsf they are really the only things that matter if rms didn exist it would be necessary to invent him
good to see ruby finally making the big time while ve been getting paid to program in ruby off and on since it now become much easier to find paying ruby work thanks to ruby on rails and watir the way things are going wouldn be at all surprised to see ruby jobs surpass python jobs this year
let put it this way you have to pay me twice as much per hour to program in perl as you would have to pay me to program in ruby but don let this get out wouldn want potential employers knowing that they could pay me lot less to program in ruby fortuneately now that there are plenty of ruby jobs out there from what seeing don need to take perl gigs anymore and that puts me in much better mood at the end of my workday

but there is also strong evidence that the complexity of life and the ridiculous amount of coincidences make it highly improbably that this all happened by accident no there isn there is no serious doubt among scientists that evolution driven by natural selection which is anything but random or accidental mutation and genetic drift is able to produce complex life this life is too complex argument was long ago dismissed and discredited but keeps getting dredged up by creationists and others who are simply ignorant of the available evidence if you want to believe that god created the universe and occasionally intervened in evolution to achieve desired result whether it be humans mosquitoes or bubonic plague fine science can neither prove or disprove such occasional meddling but don call it science id is inherently unscientific it isn testable and thus cannot truly be taught in scientific manner strongly recommend that you check out the talk origins website especially the faq http www talkorigins org there is nothing or otherwise that says that christianity or any other religion cannot be involved in the government in some way read the st amendment again congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof if the government is spending tax dollars to teach christian fundamentalist dogma in public school science classrooms then it quite clear to me that the government is indeed respecting an establishment of religion

sorry honestly have really hard time believing either side there has been so much that is willfully made up and lied about to support either view that don really know who to believe few years back was reading book about evolution and the explanation that was given as to how dinosaurs led to birds was that certain dinosaurs started jumping from tree to tree and slowly their scales would become feathered from this eventually that led to the development of feathers sorry but that is downright the most retarded thing ve ever heard in my life no matter how much take lizard and feather his scales its offspring aren going to slowly develop feathers that just doesn happen don know if it was just bad explanation but it doesn take biologist to realize that many explanations given for both evolution and creation are inherently flawed would also refer you to the true origin http www trueorigin org to_deception asp website which as you can guess is the other side of the coin there are equally intelligent people on both sides of the issue also like to provide you few quotes from francis crick we all know who he is right the scientist who discovered dna pp if particular amino acid sequence was selected by chance how rare an event would this be this is an easy exercise in combinatorials suppose the chain is about two hundred amino acids long this is if anything rather less than the average length of proteins of all types since we have just twenty possibilities at each place the number of possibilities is twenty multiplied by itself some two hundred times this is conveniently written and is approximately equal to that is one followed by zeros moreover we have only considered polypeptide chain of rather modest length had we considered longer ones as well the figure would have been even more immense the great majority of sequences can never have been synthesized at all at any time an honest man armed with all the knowledge available to us now could only state that in some sense the origin of life appears at the moment to be almost miracle so many are the conditions which would have had to have been satisfied to get it going the plain fact is that the time available was too long the many on the earthâ surface too diverse the various chemical possibilities too numerous and our own knowledge and imagination too feeble to allow us to be able to unravel exactly how it might or might not have happened such long time ago especially as we have no experimental evidence from that era to check our ideas against crick francis life itself its origin and nature new york simon amp schuster pp gt congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof also maybe am interpreting this differently than you but understand that to mean that congress will not respect the establishment of one particular religion ie the anglican church of england this doesn mean that government cannot be influenced by religion as this is again democracy but rather that it will not establish one religion as the national one

argument for dynamic typing my reaction yes and no it is convenience at low cost in terms of errors and bloating we are actually talking about it true that fairly good coder will get further quicker with python and like the language but ve already run into enough run time trouble like accidentally truncing floats by adding them to integer variables and having library incompatible string types that needed to always cast to str anyway and testing will only take you only so much beyond simple bordercases and yes neither testing or strong typing is ideal but don like not actually writing types in what is acually typed language imagine having to type int in python would that destroy all its good and what happened to the complaints about function and especially operator overloading in that said would probably prefer inferential typing like ocaml has no time wasted and never ambigious of course the main point here and in various discussion as of late is good programmer clean programmers will often treat variables as if they were statically typed anyhow just because it more transparent and there rarely reason not to bad programmer will write spaghetti both ways you can onyl really argue against language syntax when it lures even okay coders into bad code often details like perhaps java exceptions which invite you to either become extremely verbose or catch and re throw exceptions the latter destroying the useful part of the stack trace rendering exceptions half useless frankly you can say any of this for any abstraction and like for most of them also that you need to know know the rules to break them for example say you cannot handle dynamic typing well without understanding typing

think he just likes to say the word competition http www sptimes com state shtml florida has bad school system and jeb bush has been trying to fix it for while his methods are pretty questionable in my eyes vouchers public money to private schools that stossel was talking about take students away from public schools and into private schools so since public schools are bad we will stop using them that doesn seem like an answer to me standardized testing and school grades so now teachers have to teach to these rediculous standardized tests and worse the schools performance is measured on them failing schools get less money and schools get more money sounds like way to fix the problems while government may not be good thing to have big in some areas think education is one of the areas where the government should be involved the government is for the people by the people and people need to be educated if we privatize education then only the people who can afford to be educated will get that way maybe some people don have problem with that but those are the same people who get mad when their store front is vandalized by graffiti or they get robbed by some gangbanger see education as the only answer to the fundamental problems of poverty

stossel doesn have very good idea how the belgian school system works in belgium all schools are government subsidized including universities and other higher eduction by the way my university education cost me about per year in fees there are public schools government run and free schools mostly catholic smaller percentage using alternative education systems like steiner schools so all schools are subsidized but they are not all government run there quite range to choose from from disciplinarian catholic schools to anything goes steiner like schools now there still are large difference even between government run schools the teaching staff has lot of choice in how to fill in the curriculum and location makes difference if kindergarten school is located in an immigrant neighbourhood the teachers need to spend lot of effort teaching dutch to the children that don speak it at home which is kind of boring for those that do edit actually after reading that article bit closer and actually viewing the episode think was wrong saying he doesn get the belgian school system got the impression he was kind of misusing the belgian situation to prove point he was trying to make about competition but having seen the episode think it actually pretty well reasoned

that patent falsehood no pun intended my sister works as clinical investigator for one of the larger pharmas and she sees the money that flows into it as well as the time and effort the scope of clinical trials is so huge that there are postgraduate degrees focusing solely on that topic and the public doesn finance drug tests nor does it finance fda compliance in actuality the drug companies pay for the privelege of being certified as safe by the fda those costs are borne by the drug companies secondly with the way gov is so intricately intertwined in everyday life it hard to find examples of any kind of work where the government which chomsky equates with the public when it doing stuff he likes and with the ruling class when it not is not involved at some level that doesn mean that because the government funds research in woodland development mining and smelting that chomsky doesn own the sq ft home of his in swanky boston suburb or the sq ft vacation edition that was built with wood stone and metal that the us military has bankrolled his research since he started doesn mean he has no right to the massive salary mit pays him that the government assumes the risk of saving his life in the event he sinks one of his yachts doesn mean he isn entitled to those either so that is yet another example of chomsky talking out his ass but then chomsky been lying for living for years and most of his starstruck acolytes like teenage girls with the latest tiger beat heartthrob will gobble up everything he says requiem for critical thinking is in order

this is basic economics human nature people work for incentives both positive and negative the negative incentives for poor performance have been removed from the public schools yes there are good teachers but they are from the smaller percentage of the population that can self motivate the majority of humans need both postive and negative reinforcement to live up to their potential we have all seen this happen in the private sector poorly managed company that does not use real world performance metrics to measure and reward punish good work will find itself filled with slackers that surf the web and drink lot of coffee the difference is in the private sector these companies eventually become unprofitable and fail in the public sector the revenue stream is guaranteed no matter what the performance of the unit is and thus public schools that do half as good with twice the money as simple old fashioned catholic school with the same kids in the same neighborhoods public education from the same people that brought you fema the dmv and the va

every dollar spent on public education is dollar taken away through taxes somewhere else imagine if all the billions of dollars being spent on education were simply left in the pockets of the people who earned them the poor and middle class actually bear relatively high tax burden though sales taxes property taxes which raise rents etc and it much easier to replace broken system than to replace it the companies that exist today exist only because they are successful turning around failing company is rare because it is so difficult the important thing to remember is that people are not the same as systems the death of the system can be beneficial to the people trapped in it higly recommend john taylor gatto essays he former employee of the new york school system http www preservenet com theory gatto html

monopolies of any sort tend to breed one size fits all products services for its clients it just easier to administer and where else are the clients going to go so we have schools all across the country where students are divided into groups of around based on age is that really the only way to teach is it even the best way what about groups of or what about dividing students based on interest in subject or ability monopolies kill innovation and public schools are perfect example of that let parents choose and we ll see innovation again

this should come as no surprise once you remember that public education in the usa is government monopoly the reason in usa may be this but want to share different experience in italy education was mostly government monopoly much more monopoly than it is in the united states in the past decades italian school was at the top of european standards but now it is no longer true for multiple reasons social changes today lot of people graduates teachers are no longer selected as they were in the past reform that made the school more like company now school managers tend to lower the level of the school so kids will select this simpler school instead of an hard one more kids more money also in the past it was possible to selectively reject kid for math or latin now you can either pass or be rejected for the whole year another counter example of this may be cuba schools are government monopoly there but education level is high compared to other more freedom countries speding similar amount of money in education

recently an indiana state rep suggested paying teachers based on their class state test results think about this schools in impovrished areas have lower test scores than areas where the wealthier higher class live can you imagine how quickly good teachers would flock to those better areas away from the kids who have lower test scores and teachers actually get parental support to me this idea is the same logic that stossel uses the main point it is not the teachers that is the problem yes we all had several teachers that were idiots but if you look at the system you need to realize that teachers are constrained by admin parents government the unions and other fellow teachers good teachers can teach anymore because the methods that work aren pc anymore my wife is teacher and spends of her time disciplining kids whose parents never taught them discipline she has to act like lawyer and gather enough evidence to prove the she did not make up allegations of misbehavior otherwise the parents go nuts my kid can never do wrong syndrome and she gets in big trouble which then necessitates the union existence to back her up which should be admin job but they re too scared of not being pc enough in front of the parents who do not have to account to anyone blaming the teacher is just finding scapegoat and not addressing the real issues or at least understanding that it lot more complex than bad teachers or no child left behind also you can compare country like the us to belgium that asinine are the two countries similar in good amount of major categories not really

what the fuck was that rant all about is the author like with very small penis who can resist going to bathhouse in spite of all his drivels
using standardized testing to grade and reward schools wonâ work because it doesnâ encourage teachers to teach well instead it encourages them to teach the test this isnâ true competition itâ an artificial government competition parents are better at judging what teachers and schools are good for their kid so lets let them decide what schools to reward or punish the problem isnâ that competition itself is bad but rather that standardized testing develops the wrong kind of competition when government tries to create artificial competition it will fail and market will develop to exploit the fallibilities of whatever highly bureaucratic dumb system is used

what oh please his is just case of the oh noes the awareness is useful but it not quality information it abuse you want to report not potential this is not rootkit no one can do anything with it sure securitywise the hiding from the windows api is not ideal if say spyware and viruses can abuse it but in that logic everything and most people run is bad it all runs with admin level privileges and is free to do whatever it wants yes there are valid points to be made about trust and likely increase of abuse voyeuristically small or stupidly larger like the sony drm rootkit thing or even things sending home more than it strictly needs to and without your knowledge like as seem to recall windows media player

one thing that is interesting is that the united states tends to educate everyone in the same system it usually college prep system whereas in germany only the best academic students stay in the prep track if you can perform on their tests you go into different track mechanics or what not so it seems that their most academically gifted are compared to all of our students as group so is it really apple to apple comparison

whether true in this specific case or not this is something that must be considered are we ok with parents having their kids taught bs eg creationism as fact think that far more abusive than uniforms myself
good article as someone who has seen amazing professors fired because they had the balls to fail students who cheated during tests or never showed up to tests something is going to have to change when two students talk during the test and get fs on that test and file academic grievances and win because their parents donated hundreds of thousands of dollars the day before you know something is wrong most students suck most students don deserve as more than half of students currently in college don belong there maybe if we stopped pushing college on everyone we wouldn have some of these idiots

how many you can hand out depends on what college you re at that doesn make lot of sense for absolutist grading if you want an you better master the material regardless of what school it is and how badly the other students did that said like to thank all the lazy stupid people in my ee classes who made me look like an student
http daringfireball net so full of pathos these are
agree with everything except your last line you really thing the solution is to kick people out of college keep running into this elitism thats starting to bug me people want the good ol days when only few special people could get into college think this is rediculous everyone should have the opportunity to be educated the higher the education the better for our society now if they aren getting what they expected they should be told tough shit because most of these students got what they deserved just think that pushing college on everyone is good thing and something that should only be more prevelant education is what makes things better not excluding people that you dont like
the point isnt the popularity its the visibility of your comment do you want to be voted down so much that your post is on the bottom of the pile even though what you said was rational and well presented arguement just because people didnt agree with your point if the reasons for voting down were off topic troll flamebait when people recognize that the comment is not one of those they will in turn vote it back up this is just slashdots model im interested in seeing what these guys can do
can they educate for free who is going to set up the school in the middle of the ghetto which private company is going to do that did you even read my post gt then only the people who can afford to be educated will get that way you are one of those people that can afford to gt will not be sending my children to public schools even though ll probably have to pay for that particular money sink notice that money sink line thats evidence that you are privileged have you thought about the family that makes year and schedules their power bill outages you think they are going to pay whatever minimal yearly cost for their kid to go to school why dont you just tell them to get job fuck it they dont need education right because capitalism will take care of them

modded you up even though whole heartedly dissaggree with your post you are contributing to the discussion with your own points just dont think killing public education will fix everything magically educating people is expensive and not financially rewarding well maybe if your educating rich kids but mean everybody no one wants to do it mean educate everybody so the government has to step in here as society we should be embracing education and encouraging it just because it looks cheaper to do it privately doesn mean it should be done while we are doing things cheaper why don we privatize the military we could have private companies develope our armed forces the best militias would protect our country sounds like pretty bad idea right even though competition would free billions trillions of dollars for tax payers that no longer had to support military budgets feel the same way about education its the governments responsibility
yes because the solution to everything is to ignore the problem out of sight out of mind if you want to think of truely open system you should think of the whole system not just one school where problem kids can be removed from where do they go to school after school until they have to be homeschooled so nobody will teach this persons kid and its most likely shes not an upstanding soccermom right so this kid doesn get educated great one more problem for society because the school was to scared to fix it with education
only the truly evil would make music video glorifying the killing of people
funny how tests came to be used as grading schools the original tests as far as recall where only intended to check if the pupil understood the subject and they werent scalar graded but the errors showing up in the tests were commented on by the pupils teacher good idol for education systems is the finish schools

you are assuming that most of the students at very prestigious schools deserve to be there don believe that is an assumption that you should base an argument on very prestigious schools are about research and graduate students they could care less about whom the undergraduate students are as long as they pay their tuition and have the resources to contribute to the school in the future
an interesting article http www motherjones com news qa html on the subsidies pharma gets not an expert on drug companies however have looked fairly closely into the high tech industry and we re definitely awash in subsidy simply ask bill gates dad http www taxpolicycenter org publications template cfm pubid let talk about the question of why people are wealthy there is myth that it function of enormous personal attributes the individual wealth which is generated in this economy is in my judgment and doubt that there is much that anyone could disagree with about this is function of the innovative businesses which are created as result of federal research but you understand that the people who benefit from that research get it free so if somebody starts software company or biotechnology company or even if somebody owns building in downtown washington which you rent to those people it starts from the same place it starts from this incredible research activity which is going on with federal money bill gates sr

mother theresa http en wikipedia org wiki criticism added that the public image of mother teresa as helper of the poor was misleading and that only few hundred people are served by even the largest of the homes of teresa donors were evidently under the impression that their money was being used to build hospitals in dr robin fox then editor of the british medical journal the lancet visited the home for dying destitutes in calcutta now kolkata and described the medical care the patients received as haphazard he observed that sisters and volunteers some of whom had no medical knowledge had to make decisions about patient care because of the lack of doctors in the hospice dr fox specifically held teresa responsible for conditions in this home and observed that her order did not distinguish between curable and incurable patients so that people who could otherwise survive would be at risk of dying from infections and lack of treatment conceded that the regimen he observed included cleanliness the tending of wounds and sores and kindness but he noted that the sisters approach to managing pain was disturbingly lacking

some people are so full of crap yes some people have misused christianity and other religions to take political and monetary power from others but they ve done the same thing with everything else you don have religion and its easier to say its just the survival of the fittest as way to justify doing evil things people will do evil things with or without religion but all of sudden we should ignore all of the good things christians and other religious people have done throughout history southeast asia would want to say bye to their entire hospital system because most of it was set up by missionaries the tribes living in the jungles of the amazon would have to give up virtually all of their modern eductation because that too was brought by missionaries whether you want to believe it or not there are people who have given their lives helping others because they felt like they were serving god its bit like the statment guns don kill people people kill people same thing religion doesn do wrong people do wrong some of you really need to take reality pill and get off the idea that somehow by ridding the world of religion and teachings such as the one from christ to love your neighbor as yourself the world would all of sudden be better place dare you to go through the new testament and show me single teaching of christ that is negative toward human beings and their treatment of others in anyway christ taught people to love god and love each other you going to argue with that

wait so you are going to discredit mother theresa work because of her own limitations that she could do very little about okay so theresa had to make difficult decisions about medical care because they didn have enough doctors is that fault of her own really just cut out the rhetoric the woman was out doing what she could yet somehow you are going to try and discredit what she did yeah sure that easy to do while you sit on your pc at home and live nice life its not so easy when you give up your life to help others and face the reality of that day by day she wasn perfect no one is but at least she was doing something can you say the same for yourself know what it is like worked as missionary down in the slums of south dallas last summer we worked with crack addicts prostitutes etc the first two weeks was there there were murders within about mile its not an easy life you have to make tough decisions sometimes you don have enough money to help someone sometimes people use you just to continue with their addictions but you try and that all you really can do the church worked at was poor and when say poor mean poor it wasn any megachurch with seating for it was single room building with seating for maybe but this little church had managed to rent out an apartment complex across the street renovate it and was now serving homeless people food every other day they provided medical care to prostitutes and crack addicts sometimes wonder what some of those people would do if that church wasn there and the pastor think that man worked about hours day promise you he wasn getting lot of money for doing it but he loved people and he is still currently giving up his life to help others and you should have the respect to not try and shoot that down with petty criticisms again you feel it necessary to try and discredit the work of women who gave up her life for others want to know what is it that you are doing for others

think you are wrong about this jesusphreak so theresa had to make difficult decisions about medical care because they didn have enough doctors is that fault of her own yes the order received hundreds of millions of dollars but chose to use it to alleviate the suffering of the poor mother theresa mission was one and despite being probably the richtest religious order in the world to the tune of probably million in donations per year despite this money being given by donors to alleviate the suffering of the poor the poor were helped little at all and the donors were cheated with the money probably going to the vatican not to the poor ll just point to this translation of an article in the german magazine stern http are berkeley edu atanu writing teresa html this points to one thing something that mother teresa reiterated very frequently in her speeches and addresses that she far more concerened with life after death than the mortal life teresa business was money for good conscience the donors benefitted the most from this the poor hardly whosoever believed that mother teresa wanted to cahnge the world eliminate suffering or fight poverty simply wanted to believe it for their own sakes such people did not listen to her to be poor to suffer was goal almost an ambition or an achievement for her and she imposed this goal upon those under her wings her actual ordained goal was the hereafter growing fame the founder of the order became somewhat conscious of the misconceptioons on which the mother teresa phenomenon was based she wrote few words and hung them outside mother house tell them we are not here for work we are here for jesus we are religious above all else we are not social workers not teachers not doctors we are nuns question then remains for what in that case do nuns need so much money
fun site period
trying to figure out what point you are trying to make is it that religious people aren perfect think that obvious still don think that means that religion needs to be innoculated against as said before religion is used for the wrong things that doesn mean that religion itself is wrong
just cut out the rhetoric do not think it means what you think it means how does quoting from wikipedia become rhetorical will ignore the personal attacks promise you he wasn getting lot of money for doing it but he loved people and he is still currently giving up his life to help others and you should have the respect to not try and shoot that down with petty criticisms now is rhetorical in fact it is rather sneakily sophist of you to suggest would criticize such commendable effort by yourself and by the pastor have more respect for this paster and actually for your actions in this than for someone with hundreds of millions in the bank with the religious conviction that it would be mistake to use that money to alleviate the suffering of the poor you feel it necessary to try and discredit the work of women who gave up her life for others want to know what is it that you are doing for others not enough not enough but uh didn receive like oh dollars in donations over the years did

microsoft showed off some of its technologies in development thursday at its redmond campus although it wouldn allow reporters to see them all one tool which could be available in the next year tries to predict user age and gender based on web sites the person visits another system could home in on the outfit person is wearing in television show and tell viewers where to buy similar clothing for example viewers of sex and the city could click on carrie bradshawâ designer shoes as she walks down new york street and be taken straight to the shoemakerâ website one research project would show advertisers the breakdown of users visiting particular web site based on their age gender and location the adlab was borne partly out of sense of urgency that now was the time for microsoft to take leadership position in the online advertising market key to that was improving ways to target ads to internet users
the point am trying to make is that consider the religious order of mother theresa to be huge black hole into which lot of goodwill and money from millions of people has disappeared without producing the results that those people were rightfully expecting instead it was used to strengthen the dogma that this life is the throw away one and the life is what we should focus our efforts on dogma find morally repulsive do you understand

the current grading system is meaningless imagined system where everyone was ranked instead of graded that is when class is finished based on their test scores they are ranked best to worst in academic performance over the course of school your class percentile ranking would be an average of your rankings in your classes then when high school is done you can say did better than of the other students and in college did better than of the other students sure there would be plenty of problems associated with such system
probably because people actually now here are sick of the web hype like me for instance what the hell is web anyway beyond marketing buzzword
gt ps religion doesn do good people do good and that what ve been trying to say people do good an evil there isn any one activity that leads them to doing so any talk of innoculating things that give hope to billions of people and has led to the improvement of countless lives is ridiculous imo

crappy column layout but good article perfectly describes my situation
gt instead it was used to strengthen the dogma that this life is the throw away one and the next life is what we should focus our efforts on dogma find morally repulsive do you understand don think you totally understand in the christian mindset this life isn throw away one and the next one isn the only one the next life is merely continuation of the first people who take such actions and give up their lives for others aren throwing away their lives they are using it for anothers benefit its just about the most selfless thing you can do not sure how its morally repulsive

one myth debunked
doubtlessly people will commit evil deeds with or without religion acknowledge that in the name of religion countless good works have been done but also countless intolerances have been promoted christianity most familiar case study has messiah who is the ultimate pacifist there is no ambiguity with the avatar who taught his followers to offer the other cheek to the transgressor an eight year old should be able to pick up on that one but apparently century after century of kings and dictators were unable to grasp it even while they proclaimed to carry christ banners this isn thing of the past either assuming you ve read the new testament pretty well could you please explain how an administration that so led country to war could be led by someone who claims to pray to jesus daily for guidance maybe there another jesus missed admittedly he could be one of few misguided souls but if that the case how come the organized political wing of the christian right supports him so staunchly and church goers overwhelmingly voted for him understand that there lot more at stake than war but just can reconcile that one the residual christian in me sees it as deal breaker oh and one more little thing you should see the pamphlets snuck into care packages and sent to soldiers in iraq by the christian fundamentalist congregations still got few my favorite one has picture of muslim in arab garb burning in hellfire bowing down and saying jesus christ is lord as he is judged really should scan those and get them posted religion can attempt to use its carrot and stick approach to guide its adherents on to the hmmm what right path saved path but ultimately the only thing that has chance is for people to have empathy for the plight of their fellow human and you can fear or bribe that into someone oh and by the way really like jesus and his teachings just need to keep his followers the hell away from me

next life is merely continuation of the first granted during my years of catholic schooling did not pay great deal of attention but when the next life is forever and you really believe this is true as mother theresa did then the pain and suffering in this life are of less importance and probably beneficial to the soul her actions or inaction are logical seen from her belief in the afterlife from non believer point of view her order has squandered great opportunity to help the weak and alleviate the pain of the suffering and has sucked up great deal of money that was intended to be used in such way who take such actions and give up their lives for others aren throwing away their lives they are using it for anothers benefit its just about the most selfless thing you can do not sure how its morally repulsive wasn talking about lives the missionaries of charity was talking about the lives of the ones that turned to them for help you have misinterpreted what wrote so will try to explain myself again mother theresa driving force was her belief which led her not to take the actions that humanistic western world would have expected her to take but led her to care more for the souls than for the bodies of those in her care in the logic of the true believer it is more important to save soul from eternal damnation than it is to cure their tuberculosis in fact bit of suffering is good for the soul baptising is more important than sterilizing needles that is the inescapable logic if you truly believe in the afterlife this was the belief of mother theresa and the catholic church agrees since mother theresa is well on her way to sainthood she has already been beatified since am not great believer in the existence of the eternal soul find this devaluation of life morally repugnant

grade point average for every class that student completes number of points are earned the number of points is given by the following equation points credit hours grade points where the credit hours roughly corresponds to the number of hours that the class meets per week in american universities and colleges students can expect that for every hour spent in the classroom hours will be necessary outside the classroom for homework and studying in one semester the typical student takes classes for total of about credit hours credit hour schedule is considered full time and earns eligibility for financial aid grade points are assigned by grading scale the most common scale is the scale where most schools do not use anything below is considered failing and receives my software engineering class meets three times week mwf from to this is hours of actual time in class but the class is for credit hours if receive an in the class will get points the grade point average is calculated from all classes for which the student has received grade points gpa sum grade points sum credit hours the semester gpa includes classes taken in particular semester the cumulative gpa includes all classes that the student has taken in university student must earn only to get gpa student who receives an equal number of as will have gpa around each grade contribution to the gpa is weighted by the class number of credit hours this means that hour class has more affect on your gpa than hour class let take hypothetical student called joe joe has just begun his third year in university he junior he has already taken credit hours of classes for which he has earned grade points joe current cumulative gpa this indicates that joe receives roughly equal numbers of and or for every that joe receives he earns three to make up for it now let look at joe schedule for this semester credits software design credits linear algebra credits intermediate japanese credits physics ii credits introduction to sociology credits total let pretend that it is the end of the semester and joe is expecting to receive an in linear algebra in software design and an in japanese his grades for physics and sociology are hovering between and these two classes have pending assignments that will swing the grades to or to joe is pretty good student but he didn manage his time very well and now doesn have enough time to do an excellent job on both assignments should joe choose to earn an in physics and in sociology or vice versa the merits of the two subjects aside let look at the effect on his gpa an in physics will earn grade points while an in sociology would earn in physics earns grade points while in sociology earns he anticipating these grade points points previously earned points for in software design hr points for an in linear algebra hr points for an in intermediate japanese hr or points for physics ii hr or points for introduction to sociology hr when the semester is finished he will have hours of earned credit if he gets an in physics and in sociology then he will earn grade points if he goes for an in physics and an in sociology then he will get grade points how will this affect his cumulative gpa cumulative gpa cumulative gpa joe perceives himself to be in the interval between and so the choice appears to have bearing of on his cumulative gpa this is flawed reasoning that snares many students joe must remember that he will have earned about credit hours when he graduates if his gpa is then he will have grade points his choice between an in physics and an in sociology accounts for only or of his final gpa the typical engineering student spends at least years thinking about his gpa students who begin thinking about their gpa after their first year of study will probably graduate in years engineering students who take years to realize their academic peril usually require years to graduate the gpa is our slave master students with more than feel that every grade less than an is black mark on their transcript because it brings their gpa down they work so hard for their grades and give up social activities to spend more time studying in my opinion the comfortable region is between and students in this region are earning and and can afford to get in class that is very boring these students may be just as smart as the gt students but they make different choices some of them would be gt but they have to work and don have much time to study the biggest injustice of the gpa system is that everyone looks at the cumulative gpa which represents the student entire undergraduate career students who have difficulty adjusting to life at university often earn poor grades in their first and second years these poor grades mar the gpa and make significant improvement impossible even if student consistently earns in each subsequent semester the cumulative gpa can remain very low most graduate school programs have minimum cumulative gpa requirements many employers look only at the cumulative gpa when evaluating new graduate academic performance the knowledge of this can evince an enormous amount of stress for the struggling first or second year student in my opinion schools should calculate year gpa rather than cumulative gpa at least employers and graduate schools should request the semester gpas for the final semesters of student undergraduate studies these scores will show any improvement in the student performance that may be hidden in cumulative gpa
agree with everything except your last line you really thing the solution is to kick people out of college keep running into this elitism thats starting to bug me actually think he dead on he not talking about kicking people out of college and it not elitism the only reason it seems like elitism is because our culture has an irrational obsession with college education university degree used to be special thing that only certain percentage of people certain number of professions really had any need for now it is seen as the bare minimum requirement for anything other than minimum wage service job and the sad truth is that in many cases person degree has little or nothing to do with the profession they end up in and even if it does the reality of that profession is often wildly different from what they learned in school result they or more likely their parents blew tens of thousands of dollars for piece of paper in order to gain entry to job that they would have been no less qualified for without day of college we don need to kick people out of college unless they re failing of course but we as parents employers companies and society do need to stop indoctrinating our children with the notion that college is the one true path for success there are plenty of people who need higher education for what they want to do with their lives and plenty of people who can benefit from it in general there are also plenty of people who have no need for it or at least don need to jump into it right out of high school we are drastically misusing our universities and the results are not the least bit surprising

was falling asleep for the most part but the last part caught my attention it provided piece to puzzle that had for while regarding the mindset of the chinese people people in china not chinese outside of china china for the longest time witness the emperors warlords communist party create wealth through power not innovation the whole system and society are geared towards power wealth now with the rapidly opening of china the influx of technology and blooming startups the old ways have not caught up to the new reality hence the weird practices encountered by westerners or even more liberal asians on the surface many chinese can grasp this concept but the actual execution is subjected to much contortion the sheer number of people the unique political ecosystem and the thousand years of culture surely make change daunting nevertheless unprecedented wealth creation in china as we speak great piece

suspect that the author of the slashdot post may be embellishing the truth somewhat doubt very much that the foreman would have bowed to his superior wisdom in this situation yes in theoretical world pythagoras theorem could be employed to derive perfect rectangle but in the real world the technique of measuring the two diagonals is the most practical effective way of verifying that your rectangle is true the pythagoras technique cannot actually that rectangle is true it can only suggest measurements that work and does not take into account failures of implementation

the oposite can also be the case where faculty are so ready to pass everybody they can that grades become meaningless remember once in the first year of full time college course was taking one of the modules was pretty simple mathematics the class was full of people who didn want to put the effort in to learn this stuff that they should already have been taught in school and so when the time came for the final year exams and two other people achieved marks and the rest of the class were spread between and the passing mark was supposed to be but the faculty realised that there was no way the majority of the class would be able to achieve that and so they had to decide whether to cancel the course altogether or simply pass everybody needless to say they passed everybody

guess you didn know that orwell was socialist probably way to the left of tim robbins the book is study of totalitarianism and particularly the role of censorship it is not about socialism at all but about how country can become totalitarian nightmare by frightening the population into giving up liberties and accepting censorship it was based on his experiences working for the uk government censoring news stories on the pretext of national security during the war after the war lot of prohibitions carried on and the book title is play on the year of publication it is showing nightmare future and saying this could be us if we carry on down this path

first time heard nazis described as socialists one of orwell big objections to soviet russia was that it was perceived as socialist when it was nothing of the kind he saw stalinism as equivalent to any other form of fascism which made him unpopular with certain elements of the left and the uk government who tried to block publication when russia was an ally as far as understand he didn turn on his socialist views at all rather ironic that the book jacket should say that he did http www theorwellreader com essays storgaard html because of the obvious anti communism in nineteen eighty four the book was great success in the usa where mccarthyism had just reared its head it was overlooked however that orwell in the book says that all ideologies in the mid twentieth century were authoritarian because nineteen eighty four was misinterpreted and in some cases misused orwell wrote in my recent novel is not intended as an attack on socialism or on the british labour party of which am supporter but as show up of the perversions to which centralized economy is liable and which have already been partly realized in communism and fascism do not believe that the kind of society describe necessarily will arrive but believe allowing of course for the fact that the book is satire that something resembling it could arrive believe also that totalitarian ideas have taken root in the minds of intellectuals everywhere and have tried to draw these ideas out to their logical consequences

according to http en wikipedia org wiki george_orwell political_views orwell wrote the following in every line of serious work that have written since has been written directly or indirectly against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism as understand it what completely fail to understand is how society can be socialist but not totalitarian in corresponding degree in socialist society the government takes under the threat of force the fruits of the laboror for the greater good to me the threat or use of government force against its citizens is the definition of totalitarianism it doesn matter if the government was democratically elected or seized power the net result is the same and only varies by degrees as result all governments lie somewhere on the spectrum between total anarchy and complete totalitarianism as an objectivist libertarian am lot more comfortable erring towards the anarchist end of the spectrum

they were socialist only in name http en wikipedia org wiki socialism socialism gt the german nazis national socialists used the word socialist in their official name but some scholars argue that this was done purely for propaganda purposes and that they tended to adopt either pro worker or pro business line depending on the given audience the nazis did demand some nationalization of big industries and land reform before their rise to power however once in power they allowed friendly capitalists to thrive while liquidating socialists everywhere including from within their own party in the night of the long knives as hitler himself explained he would not repeat the mistake of lenin and put the party leaders in charge of industries since they don have enough knowledge and experience his idea was to allow the capitalists to control their companies if they did it effectively and obeyed the orders of the national socialist party some socialists reject the racialist theories and totalitarianism of the nazis while nazis rejected the egalitarianism and social class oriented perspective of some socialists

harvard university biologists have identified molecular pathway active in neurons that interacts with rna to regulate the formation of long term memory in fruit flies the same pathway is also found at mammalian synapses and could eventually present target for new therapeutics to treat human memory loss we have been able to monitor for the first time the synthesis of protein at the synapses between neurons as an animal learns and we found biochemical pathway that determines if and where this protein synthesis happens this pathway called risc interacts with rna at synapses to facilitate the protein synthesis associated with forming stable memory in fruit flies at least this process makes the difference between remembering something for an hour and remembering it for day or more

the slashdotter appreciation of the difference in value systems is right on though his subtle suggestion of rational discourse between the differing sides is not it too late globalization has pervaded society that has largely stagnated in economic social and governmental evolution or growth if the term evolution strikes you as too politically incorrect the consumer goods of the west or their knockoffs have shown up en masse and satellite dishes with hot chips hang from the balconies of level after level of government built ghettos they ve seen what they don have there aren many promising jobs or even distant hope of one and they have religious leaders antagonizing them further by insisting that what intrigues them is the work of the devil it was nearly enough to make one miss the christian fundamentalists but not quite on top of that there was wounded pride that was shared regardless of religious sect or ethnic difference which is really something since you could construct complex flow chart of who hates who just going by those factors the shiites hate the sunnis the sunnis hate the shiites and the kurds see them both as dogs they all support the palestinians against the israelis anti semitism might be the one unifying factor stumbled across or anti jew might be more apt cause aren most of the region technically semitic which was ironic since all of them looked at the palestinians with shameful disdain the interesting part was how many of them were disgusted with the the religious leaders that scare the west though this was voiced in very quite tones indicative of how they scare the locals too should dislose that my amateur anthropology was largely confined to college educated english speakers in most of the area universities particularly the technical ones you learn english or you flunk out since the the courses are taught in english and the textbooks are western they were also mostly practicing muslims though they reminded me of american catholics picking and choosing what aspects of the doctrine they would observe came away from my little foray realizing just how screwed we were the conflict between the west and the middle east or near east or central asia or whatever the hell you want to label it has so many different converging factors and long building momentum that it seems inevitable it also seems as if it shouldn be suprise it also appears logical that other parts of the world particularly africa will be following suit in some way as soon as it crawls out of unbelievably destitute poverty to just ridiculously destitute poverty envy religion oppression poverty all play roll don think anyone has clue as to how to solve it but sure that any alleviation is lot more complex than just the application of hard power didn support the justification for iraq and war sucks but damn hope it works out

as respectfully dissenting note think this is pretty insightful blog entry it interesting to hear someone talk about norvig book paip which he right about many understandably do think it the best programming book in existence even given its flaws he homes in on how lisp users can simply memoize function tell it to cache its own return values so it can emit them later again in one command and the data directed technique that lisp users can use where you enter data in your sourcecode and have that be executed do think though we should keep in mind that he talking from microsoft perspective so his metrics of usability are different than what an alan kay or jef raskin might have

the author argues for preemptive strikes due to dangers from islamism as the ideological cocktail that produced islamism was as potent as either of the extreme ideologies the west had produced in the previous century communism and fascism islamism was anti western anti capitalist and anti semitic what he totally fails to see is the role that preemptive strikes by the us played in creating this anti western sentiment and the reactions on additional actions like this sure you can shoot down everyone getting strong enough to be danger to you for while but sooner or later you miss and then you will have more problems than the diplomatic solution could ever produce

this is clearly case of self projection your paraphrasing mistakenly assumes an equivalence between socialism communism and centralised economy where there is none what orwell said is more reliable than what you speculate that he might have been unable to express it is well known that ingsoc was dig at people who label themselves socialists while pursuing contradictory agendas and not at socialism itself it is not true that orwell had lifetime of believing in socialism he had been an anarchist previously but rejected it quite easily on the grounds that if crime was profitable you would either need strongly enforced criminal justice system or live under gangster rule he had also been strong pacifist and changed his mind quite openly on that when he realised that hitler needed to be defeated

athiests are stuck in their belief that everything is provable the dominant belief is that if it not measurable it does not exist unfortunately humans perception of the world is completely subjective we have people that we love how does an atheist measure love how do we measure joy or happiness you can but does that mean that those experiences do not exist no amount of logic can deny the subjective experience of love devout atheists are like child that says prove to me that sugar is sweet only then will taste it the proof of the sweetness is in the mouth not in the sugar to know it is sweet you must taste it there is no other way of course you begin by asking is it sugar is it sweet and you accept my assurance until you taste it then only all doubts dissolve and your knowledge becomes firsta hand and unshakable we do not ask you to believe us just trust us enough to begin every step either proves or disproves itself no fan of religions but do believe in god

you have misconception you re not stating you think all atheists have simplistic notion of what it means to exist it possible that you too suffer under that overly simplistic understanding but can be sure from merely that one posting of yours so won blame you for that yet we know perfectly well that love exists we just don think that love exists in the same way as say we ourselves exist or the same way as the internet exists or fill in the blank exists there are many different kinds of things objects concepts emotions and so on which may each exist in different fashion so in sense god does exist it substantially the same sense as the one in which the tooth fairy exists which is slightly less tangible and useful sense than the one in which santa claus exists your allegory with the taste of sugar is badly flawed in way you really should be able to figure out for yourself as hint consider the old saying reality is that which when we stop believing in it doesn go away

don think it is possible to estimate how much oil is left for one thing as oil becomes scarce oil prices rise and companies are spurred to work harder to find new sources of oil by the way really wouldn worry about humanity being too late to make massive change like moving from oil to hydrogen fuel cells the economy is great at doing stuff like that without any central planning just look how many people have ipods and other mp players now
assuming currently they are selling oil at the optimal price doing that will both hurt themselves and us say let them do it the one thing these countries are most afraid of is us not being dependent on their oil anymore if they do something like this it ll just bring that day closer

clarification sometimes you hear this argument phrased as if the ecomomy will magically cause more oil to appear after present supplies are gone and that misleading in actuality there lot of oil left in the ground that oil drillers never collect because oil drilling is usually only to efficient that figure is driven more by the world demand for oil than by limitations in extraction technology so as the oil price rises it cost effective to recover more and more oil from existing wells this is one reason taxes are another why gas prices in the us are much lower than in europe at bbl lots of oil fields in texas oklahoma amp louisiana turn on some people take this argument further and say there nothing to worry about at all because world oil price stays above bbl for few years would make it economical to start going after tar sands in canada and oil shale deposits in the rocky mountains although the technologies necessary to do this have never been demonstrated at scale
if it too late to do anything does that mean we can party like it
if oil is scarce then all the car and oil companies who are ignoring the warnings would all be out of business in twenty five years wouldn they don think they re that stupid companies are generally ruthless in being profit driven that said figure they re going to milk the oil business for as much cash as they can get out of it then magically unveil the new fuel technology once they really need it ve heard conspiracy theories about car companies it might have been ford that developed cars that ran on water but are keeping it under wraps on purpose don know how true that is but my guess is that they ve got much more ideas up their sleeves than the current hybrid and even fuel cell technology

another thing to keep in mind is that while oil supply may be limited coal and natural gas reserves are much larger estimates are million short tons recoverable coal and million short tons annual demand natural gas numbers are in similar ratio these sources count for of emissions and of emissions from electricity sectors major changes are inevitable in transportation but oil is not the limiting factor for energy related emissions given that china and india have plenty of coal limited oil does not imply sufficient reductions in emissions see http www eia doe gov oiaf ggccebro chapter html http www eia doe gov emeu international

gt any other rational person who isn too frightened to examine the evidence closely will come to the same conclusion the official story is not just inaccurate it is deliberate lie think this is the biggest problem with conspiracy theory as soon as theory is denounced as being ludicrous or irrational the conspiracy theorists jump back and claim that they know the one true reality and that everything else is lie kind of reminiscent of the intelligent design debate the conspiracy theorists and the rationalists each find the other views to be incoprehensible if anything researching conspiracy theory has taught me the fallacies of holding on to any one objective reality as being an absolute truth while ago went in few days from believing conspiracy theories were absurd to being afraid that one of david icke reptoids was going to eat me or something like that still think icke theories are brilliant in the way they incorporate so many other theories and religions into one grand conspiracy but think of it more as novel now than as an absolute truth maybe instead of immediately denouncing any conspiracy theory or anti conspiracy theory as being unobjective and lie especially for the theories of which seem to change my mind every few days we could simply cite the evidence and look at it from real objective distanced viewpoint

that the preference is acquired by growing up in particular culture rather than psychological preference for hybridization that universal it seems to me that many ideals of attraction are culturally based and preferences for attributes such as skin tones hair color or some facial features are informed more by one peers and experiences than innate attractions so cultural explanation may not be simpler as said but it is at least competing and should be addressed

legalizing drugs would also allow taxes to be collected on their sale less police to be deployed etc overall it is very hard to make an argument for illegalized drugs as we have today we have an excellent case for comparison in prohibition in the us have never used anything other than alcohol and doubt that would use drugs if they were legal but it is idiocy to let the current solution continue

uhhh would think that especially if you are mr without degree or any knowledge other than taking the thrash out you would do well to invest in yourself jobs gates bezos can go out and buy book or few books that will significantly add to their income but someone without any knowledge as you say could certainly stand to benefit financially by buying and reading few key books or taking some classes or even getting degree btw how does one take out the thrash

if he could choose to get the money all at once agree he was rich how much person has to do for the money they get and there are probably conditions on his trust fund friend of mine recently stopped getting his trust fund money which wasn that much anyway after ignoring the conditions isn very important to whether they re rich or not in my opinion rather rich is about how much person can choose to spend instantaneously this fellow isn any richer than people on social security or retirement from the us army there certain amount he gets per month that is dependent on very little from him but he has no access to the pool from which it comes admittedly that would be nice situation to be in since it would mean that you could choose to just do whatever but lots of us are small success away from being in that situation as well including the guys who wrote this site

yes hard will explain why below but first like to point out that electricity from gas station doesn help solve the problem because the problem here is finding cheap energy not deciding which form we should turn it into once we have it brought up the chicken egg problem with building the necessary infrastructure because you seemed to think central planning will likely be unnecessary but onto how incredibly simple charging station at every gas station would be my liter cylinder non turbo car engine is kw to put that into perspective heater on full draws about kw and over year home averages about kw when floor it am consuming enough power to run houses this is small car especially by american standards now granted the car is only kw when floor it but at gas station don want to wait days for the car to be charged enough to run days petrol contains kwh liter so assuming want to only wait minutes for the equivalent of liter tank gallons of gas that megawatt source of power the petrol station requires alongside megawatt cabling but don want to wait an hour for the cars ahead of me to charge the petrol station should have at least pumps meaning megawatt power feed moreover we have to install this infrastructure in every gas station or perhaps every th station to begin with and then somehow get that kind of power to them every gas station in the country is now consuming the equivalent of homes homes if demand is round the clock now hear america already has trouble producing enough electricity there are also more subtle problems peak oil will cause permanent oil shock the spike which isn really spike because it won be coming down will likely force the economy into recession and with oil initially costing nearly times what it does today figure lots of people seem to bandy around but perhaps it wont be that bad building new infrastructure becomes prohibitively expensive so really we need to be laying out the alternative fuel infrastructure while we still have some cheap oil to build it with and say now because when america has to dip into the strategic reserve in order to avoid oil shocks because production can manage anymore when few oil rigs in the gulf coast go offline from hurricane you know peak oil is right around the corner

the thrash is kept in pocket or similar size enclosure when the user of the thrash decides to unleash it from its confines the user is performing the action take out the thrash
hmm thought should clarify peak oil since you re talking about when the oil will run out but the oil runing out is not the problem and my post won make sense if you think that what mean the reason oil is important isn because our cars run on it they only account for of it but because our economy runs on it the other in the past whenever we have grown the economy we have just pumped little more oil each day to supply it peek oil is when we ve reached the fastest that we can pump oil and any economy that wants to grow has to either find another source of cheap energy or take oil out of someone else economy to make matters worse after peek oil the speed at which we can pump it will start to decline furthering the gap between supply and demand imagine people in the desert find tap of water eventually they figure out the flow is only enough water to keep of them alive so if they split it evenly they all eventually die of thirst there plenty of water coming out of the tap it certainly hasn run out just not enough for people so rather than split it evenly and all die they decide to apply market model to it the water was dirt cheap when there was enough like oil is now but once there isn enough and it only tiny fraction not enough nobody wants to be one of the people that will die and so they all bid everything they can spare for something that used to cost so little yet the water isn anywhere near running out

it not shady at all erlang is designed to massive concurrecy whereas is not as the comparison says the problem is not apache but linux kernels unefficient concurrency model would guess that in dynamic content the difference is much larger and just one more note erlang is widely used in cell phone call centers that what it is designed for so it scales very very well to very very high load

erlang is language that deserves few minutes of fame while doubt we ll be seeing it in the mainstream limelight it has beatiful approach to concurrency that like to see available in python no candygram doesn count the concurrency model makes it far easier to write software which scales to bazillions of simultaneous tasks which for web folks has to be tantilizing how well yaws would perform against lighttpd
apache normally uses select and processes or mix of select threads and processes guess they set the benchmark up to use thread per connection though think this benchmark is more than little bogus because it comparing erlang select based model with os level threads which isn going to tell you much that interesting erlang is cool language and environment though

gave this one points because find the subject very interesting and think others should think about it as well but think the author and perhaps the professor interviewed paint an incomplete picture of the challenges of learning chinese first it is very important to note that chinese is at best an incomplete definition of the languages currently spoken in the people republic of china and by the diaspora of han chinese around the world even the separation into mandarin putonghua and cantonese guangdonghua doesn do justice to the variety of spoken chinese throughout china whereas mandarin is the official language of china based largely on the local language in beijing the capitol cantonese is spoken in hong kong and guangdong province and traditionally has been the language of the chinese diaspora due to the importance of the south east of china in international trade that said there are many different local variants of chinese which when spoken are mutually unintelligible useful comparisons to the structure of the chinese languages can be drawn from the relation of the romance languages italian french spanish portuguese romanian occitan etc to latin all of these languages share some degree of mutual intelligibility another is the case of arabic where there are many varieties of spoken arabic iraqi morrocan egyptian syrian etc and literary arabic which is common throughout based on the qur anic version of arabic that said chinese like any language is very easy for children to learn how to speak it is nonetheless difficult writing system to master even for chinese born native speakers http books google com books vid isbn for adult foreigners however it poses bit more of challenge the article points out that writing and tonality are the two main hurdles to overcome generally agree however there are number of phonemes sounds which simply do not occur in english insert your local language here which to occur in chinese these pose challenge as well tonality is either huge problem my father is tone deaf don believe he could ever become fluent in chinese or just takes lot of discipline practice remembering the mapping between sound tone combinations and meaning fortunately context aids in this process the writing system is not so bad though it requires lot of practice to maintain one skill to my surprise find it is more similar to western writing systems than ever would have suspected in the process of this discovery feel have learned very much about the relation between written and spoken language finally find the comment by dr weightman on grammar at the end particularly misleading chinese grammar seems transparent to english speakers particularly those who have studied language where modifiers are tacked on to the end of words to modify tense declension etc read finnish this is due to the lack of inflection in chinese that is changes in word order lead to changes in meaning am not too far along in my study of chinese language but find the difficulty is often over sold except to the tone deaf who should never try to learn tonal languages that not to say that it is piece of cake there are some mental hurdles tonality bizzare sounds different writing paradigm and an unfamiliar approach to grammar once those are managable at basic level find that dilligence and practice are all that are required ps ianaling am not linguist
well that finally wraps that one up for me maybe the best hoax ever
know what erlang can and can do to some degree have had the good fortune of working with it professionally and even contributed tiny tiny patch that makes it start up bit faster was merely pointing out the fact as someone else did that erlang scales doesn is not accurate because erlang is written in that doesn mean as also said that erlang isn better way than raw to put scalable code together

thought it be interesting to note that it easier to learn mandarin than cantonese because mandarin maps directly into written chinese whereas cantonese is only good to be learned as spoken language as it has many vernacular quirks that are not used in formal writings also it probably to note that if you just focus on perfecting pinyin small set of romanization that covers all mandarin pronounciations you can speak perfect mandarin without knowing single character

this argument is just the both languages are turing complete and hence equal argument in new clothes that is the implementation language of erlang is trivial detail were erlang implemented in assembler or or haskell it would not matter modulo bugs in the implementation does scale but the fact that erlang is written in does not mean that scales as well as erlang
how about next time you post link to the actual article instead of your own blog
incidentally if you want erlang concurrency without erlang syntax you can check out erlisp which is an attempt to graft the erlang concurrency model onto common lisp http www dirkgerrits com programming erlisp yaws vs lighttpd is not as far as know benchmarked
dumb question time it seems that erlang implementation of process does not map to an os thread or process with this in mind how does erlang scale to multiple processors
guess not very good at getting my point across keep saying things like erlang is better way than to put scalable code together so it not something really contesting what do not like about this benchmark is that it is not benchmarking erlang and but rather truckload of clone system calls vs select of course apache will lose in the configuration they use be interested to see the same test run with an apache configured by an apache expert and that includes the selection of proper mpm there are good reasons to talk about what nice language erlang is but beating up on someone who has their hands tied behind their back is not one of them
that has nothing to do with karma for all know if correct the hot articles are chosen based on only two factors the number of votes and the amount of time that has passed since the link has been posted in other words the links with votes making the hot section are simply new links nothing to do with karma in fact you are in the perfect position to validate this yourself just go post an interesting link and it ll most probably make the hot section with as few as votes regardless of your karma of

yes that is an excellent point and really it speaks to benchmarks in general one thing that benchmarks should and rarely do include is concise statement of what is being tested so here it should be noted that this tests how good apache is at clone vs yaws is at select numerical benchmarks like coyote gulch might note that they are essentially testing the code generation capabilities of language implementation am no apache expert how would such an experct configure apache to handle the situation described
nope

no it like team of workers who have skills well beyond mere management when you say all qualified to be managers you seem to be overly in awe of management the whole point of the article is that companies do not need nearly as much management if you trust the employees the craftsmen who know their field to do the right thing and honor their ideas and opinions they will generally rise to the challange this sort of thing is even rare in it technology companies google may be an exception that partly what leading so many smart people to abandon the corporate world in order to start their own companies which are more agile flexible and much less top heavy it time to abandon the corporation corporations are by definition dictatorships with top down control it being said lot recently the average american corporation has structure that looks very lke that of the soviet union most ceos would have been right at home in the politburo

excellent article that really brings it all together and yes the references to helicopters are alluding to bernanke remarks one time to firing up the printing presses and helicoptering in any amount of money that was needed
love to work in such an place but think that there is little to no scope for replication in other business environments the nature of the product lends itself to investing in and empowering workers in hindsight not attempting to belittle the original visionaries behind the factory success love to have such trust placed in myself at work but my company doesn sit at the top end of the bell curve in our market segment as google and this company do where work it is daily grind with pressure from the competition for product that is not nearly so demonstrably critical when paying little less for product that might not have all the bells and whistles is viable option suddenly you can empower the employees the capatilist system means that you are going to have to screw your employees at some stage process which starts with skimping on training and ends in christmas layoffs vanishing pension plans etc this ge outfit sits in position of power it is win win for the employees and the company and the consumer but it is only because buying the best components is the obviously correct decision for the airplane manufacturers if another company manages to get into truly competitive position with them perhaps even by emulating their practices and the laws of supply and demand start to be felt think you would see managers introduced to start turning the screws cynical you betcha

the first few paragraphs were just so wrong that didn bother reading the rest some examples early in the th century the economy began to dominate the world economy well the us became major economic player early in the th century but it wasn until after wwii that it began to dominate the world economy the great depression with its preceding inflation from to inflation was extremely low during that period with several years of outright deflation see http eh net hmit compare result php use dollar amp use gdpdeflation amp use unskilled amp use gdpcp amp use nominalgdp amp amount amp year amp year_result amp amount amp year_source and http inflationdata com inflation inflation_rate aspx it did not enforce the direct payment of taxes like all of its predecessor empires did but distributed instead its own fiat currency the dollar to other nations in exchange for goods that not typically how it works the us exchanges it own fiat actually fiat fiduciary dollar to other nations in exchange for their currency typically also fiat fiduciary which is then exchanged for foriegn goods and vice versa the increase in dollar holdings of foreigners via persistent trade deficits yeah that happened in the what this doing in paragraph talking about lyndon johnson when in foreigners demanded payment for their dollars in gold the government defaulted on its payment on august while the popular spin told the story of severing the link between the dollar and goldâ in reality the denial to pay back in gold was an act of bankruptcy by the government essentially the declared itself an empire it had extracted an enormous amount of economic goods from the rest of the world with no intention or ability to return those goods this is exactly backwards the us ran significant trade surpluses during that period in other words the world extracted an enormous amount of economic goods from the us in exchange for promises to pay us back with their goods and services later at interest aka debt inflating the currency at that point would have no effect on debts denominated in other currencies and would actually reduce the return to american holders of foreign debt denominated in dollars too tired to go on here hint about economics if someone starts talking about gold they re most likely nut

have you ever been to reserve bank and seen the presses humming government can and does print money at rate they feel necessary with fiat system this is planned by people smarter than you in washington to control inflation the irony is that inflation is product of these controls it is an inflation of the money supply http www mises org money asp what has government done to our money murray rothbard the american dollar is worth nothing it has no intrinsic value outside of the paper and ink the value of fiat currency is based on the reputation of the issuing government remember this is very short experiment years since the gold window was closed and inflation has been absolutely astronomical it is all related to the increase in dollars being manufactuered by the us government the entire world has had to bend over and take it they have had to sit back while the usa waggled its finger at them and made them behave the majority has been forced to sit idly by as the usg planted military installations across the globe and stomped anybody dick in the dirt that got frisky can global switch to euro for oil system virtually cripple the usg yes yes it can the euro is essentially piece of shit too just like all the other fiat currency on the planet nothing to back it up except political bullshit and endless streams of rhetoric it is failed experiment but unfortunately one that is extrememly popular to the political class for obvious reasons
and any statement followed by calling people names represents poorly worded fallacy fiat money is politician best friend period who trusts the average politician to print all the money they want with no accountability apparently by your logic only somebody that is insane would question this practice who did you vote for to fill greenspan spot oh
the article seems to miss the things that like about reddit clean layout having both postive and negative feedback and anonymous evaluation digg only has positive feedback which encourages the echo chamber effect having negative feedback lessons from biology gives better chance at readable equilibrium needing to register at digg makes it just little less open for the layout reddit appears to have absorbed the lessons of edward tufte that the characters themselves when ordered intelligently can contribute to the layout the information whilst dense is cleanly laid out

other elevators have used learning algorithims before but think their real breakthrough is the fact that they are gathering the most important information before people get on their destination it seems so obvious yet it isn find out where people are going before they get in so they can be grouped appropriately even in small building it seems as if it would help think about this situation it the end of lunchtime in an office building and group of coworkers returns all wanting to go to the th floor five others arrive as well wanting to go to various lower floors if the system had their destinations ahead of time it could direct the people to one elevator and everyone else to another one so that the group of wouldn have to wait for all the other stops the people would arrive at their destinations sooner don understand why people don like the kiosks it seems like its exactly the same as pushing the button once you get in the elevator

from what read suspect two drawing factors super lightweight threading coroutines and aesthetic factors with regards to not enough of language junkie to properly appreciate that although did read and enjoy some of the tutorials on continuationss and how that could be the next big thing in web development with regards to well like how ruby looks myself but can see people enjoying writing code in this language see some patterns that make me think of javascript which is also prototype based language so there possible vector for adopters but where with you is that the io page does poor job of articulating what it strengths are that unfortunately seems to be characteristic of many languages that have come to the fore in recent years ruby is one excellent example hope that there some articulate io developer who could talk about it
heh no kidding ruby has only gotten big in the least year due to rails just about the only way it would be the next ruby is if it had some killer app which really caught people eyes don get me wrong ruby is an excellent language and use it over anything else but the main uniqueness of ruby was how much its killer app bumped it over many other languages in the public eye other languages are very similar to ruby in other ways the main problem have from io right now just glancing at it is don think there are many books written on it programming languages can be complicated things and unless the language is well documented think part of that is having several books that the public can go out and pick up in order to learn the language its not only hard to get people knowing about language but its also hard to get them to learn it personally can sit before pc screen for hours at time reading books are no problem

ruby is well documented in japanese
duh
uh wow bet that really impresses the ladies
wasn trying to comment on how well documented ruby was only how well dare say it marketed it was beautiful language is hard thing to sell to other programmers if they never had that kind of choice to make if ruby instead made claims like write this robust algorithm in fewer lines compared to foo and is more readable maybe that would have gotten more devs to at least look at it disclaimer am not marketer although work in marketing department at any rate sure we all agree that the best marketing vehicle ruby ever had was rails suspect rails also set the bar pretty high for evaluating new languages from this point on which is just fine by me

some people myself included provide website references over print when available it more transparent unlike an obscure issue of professional journal the reader can actually go and weigh website reference for themselves it when you want to dupe people that you provide references you know your readers will not be able to check or not bother to check the extra info in any website you reference will most likely provide enough information for reader to hunt down printed works on the topic
for those of us who have played infocom games in the dark distant past this will make your day
it would be very difficult to attempt to learn chinese using only pinyin it is much easier to learn the whole language characters included this is because the characters hold the core ideas of the language most characters have several different pronunciations so the characters become an important mnemonic tool for learning to speak and listen knowledge of the characters is critical for understanding jokes and other subtleties of the language to really learn language you must learn to think in that language the characters engage the visual part of your brain in the learning and thinking process the process of learning to communicate in another language involves conversation reading writing and countless hours learning the culture spending time with native speakers this argument also applies to the japanese language pinyin mandarin romaji japanese you must learn hiragana katakana and many kanji in order to communicate effectively in japanese

actually say just the opposite if you can do this in jet engine manufacturing plant where very high quality are non negotiables you can do this pretty much anywhere less managers means saved and happier more productive employees
by submitting this article think ve just achieved the reddit equivalent of first post
about the author krassimir petrov hotmail com has received his ph in economics from the ohio state university and currently teaches macroeconomics international finance basically he saying that roughly half the population is going to be bankrupt so max out your credit cards and buy gold cause your fico score won mean jack in years
not that enthusiastic about the way this is being presented the question was not should congress impeach bush it was should congress consider impeachment the second sounds much more reasonable than the first and it incorrect to presume the percentage agreement with the second is the same as with the first after all if they re reasonable they should consider everything shouldn they
okay thats fake right
even less than that the formula is if he did bad thing should congress consider some legal formula that few understand zogby tends to score democratic positions higher but this is nakedly contrived look for republican poll tomorrow asking do you support the president efforts to expose islamic terrorists in the usa even if not all of the rules of war are followed
agree in fact it reduces to having proper leadership and less management currently earn good salary in foreign country can basically do anything want with my time but hate it why because even though my position demands it my layers of management don trust or support my decisions and work in the end always do what they think should be done in the time frame that they suck out of their thumbs
the main problem is like you said the question is should impeachment be considered so roughly of all americans think it should be thought about but its no where near the needed to actually do it it is ths vote in the house and then ths vote in the senate for impeachment correct so judging from this poll unless bush does something absolutely ridiculous over the next years which is very possible he will never be impeached
paul to what extent do you think you ve followed your own advice obvious you love essay writing and working on arc and guessing that you re enjoying yc but what about say writing ansi cl and on lisp were those written mostly for love or primarily for money prestige most curious about viaweb in another of your essays you wrote advice that seems to contradict most of what you wrote in this one where there muck there brass can find the reference but also remember comment that most successful startups are founded by people who are grossly overqualified for the technical challenges and thus presumably would rather work on more interesting problems ceteris paribus you ve also emphasized on number of occasions that starting startup requires you to work much harder than you would in any other context of course hard and fun aren mutually exclusive just got back from the mit mystery hunt where for two days worked harder than just about any other time in my life and it was also among the most fun things ve ever done but would you have worked as hard as you did at viaweb even if it wouldn have helped your chances of succeeding if today you still had the health you did as grad student would you be inclined to do it again
colbert and his writers are geniouses the guy used to be my least favourite corespondent on the daily show but now love him he still no ed helms though
hopefully paul next article will be about the value of brevity in prose
prefer simple text centered web pages when browse and search the web seek information not snazzy page layouts there not necessarily anything wrong with good graphical layout but for me it doesn add much to the overall experience on the other hand bad graphical layout takes away lot tried multiple css stylesheets for my own website but finally settled on copying the basic html starter from philip greenspun year old book on web development tweaked it bit and happy with it
justice rocks the house
bush has admitted he did bad thing
so judging from this poll unless bush does something absolutely ridiculous over the next years which is very possible he will never be impeached yes but what if congress changes more dems in november
it is ths vote in the house and then ths vote in the senate for impeachment correct no
writing briefly http paulgraham com paulgraham writing html
if this article gets as high as the rest of pg articles will be very annoyed because having read it am pretty sure that if it were written by someone without such reputation on reddit it wouldn be remotely high scoring
and what would be wrong with that people who read reddit like reading what paul graham writes even if someone else wrote something more interesting paul graham has bigger following and therefore his essays are of interest to more people therefore it follows that they ought to score higher
true but bet you find that people would still be reluctant to actually unseat the president as opposed to doing so in thought experiment the dodgier part comes later everyone wants to hold someone accountable if they did something wrong just like everyone wants to support the president in time of war don support bush but just have to call them as see them think there far too much wishful thinking on the left
simple majority in the house and in the senate
it can be much fun for them beneath the rising sun with all their kids committing suicide sounds like mommy and daddy should get off their bums and start applying some discipline probably the same niponese parenting philosophy that created the inhuman monsters that raped and murdered their way through ww until japan apologises for the attrocities they committed in ww they will get no sympathy from me the germans hate hitler and the nazi two whole generations were ravaged by guilt the japanese no apologies shame from their side no sirree they built shrines in honour of rapists and murderers and pray to them daily it been compared to the germans building temple in honour of hitler in the middle of berlin and lighting candle to his memory each day google for rape of nanking
if ruby instead made claims like write this robust algorithm in fewer lines compared to foo and is more readable maybe that would have gotten more devs to at least look at it indeed that is the course taken by the rails developers and the specific claims of improved productivity has attracted many followers the down side here is that judging by comments on the rails dev list large numbers of these cabooses see ruby rails not as better general purpose language but as better script my web app with little deep though tool it remains to be seen how many will progress to learning and appreciating ruby on its own or will instead continue to seek out the next ready made plugin or engine that will solve whatever is their current problem from poking around with io ve no doubt one can build tool of comparable virtures as rails
for sites where the content really is bottled lightning pg matthias wandel john gruber etc like their very simple layouts but for list design bloggers like shea and bowman lot of their content is immediately relevant to design so it helpful to have the articles set in really beautiful presentations on the other hand am so sick of the default blogger templates it should be criminal to launch community site that large without some measure of forced customization in the template eg thanks for choosing design now please pick heading typeface from this list as well as primary and secondary layout colour
vim wordpad
the main problem have from io right now just glancing at it is don think there are many books written on it true enough but my main gripe is poor windows support tried running some example wiki code and it just borked there needs to be better abstractions for assorted variations such as file systems good cross platform standard libraries for networking file xml etc are essential for growth also think the name io cute as it is is drawback it is not google friendly so people who are curious and go searching around my have hard time finding stuff
what not following saying that if that exact text were written by some other author on some other blog it wouldn score as high as this will if that true which is entirely my conjecture since this hasn scored very high yet then the score it accrues will be entirely due to pg name and not to the merit of his actual writing which presumably is what we care about
removed
it brilliant idea but the challenge is entirely in figuring out how to present it to the users in meaningful way and most importantly how to correct for stupid humans screwing it up ie getting on the wrong elevator the initial implementation should almost have conductor at least on the ground floor instead of fighting kiosk you simply tell the attendant that you want th floor and then he indicates which elevator to wait for alternately you could scrap the kiosk and instead just have all the floor buttons on the wall once you push floor button that floor number appears above the door of the elevator that will make the next trip there
removed
many programmers are just trying to make living and don really enjoy it of course most such people are working on the corporate accounting system or some such and writing java or cobol not working on reddit or viaweb and writing python or lisp suspect there similar division in many fields that invisible to outsiders repair computers for money and love taking on something challenging like replacing the onboard ram in an ibook but dislike figuring out exactly which piece of spyware is making somebody windows box crash
think the real savings is in simply constructing fewer elevators intrigued enough to try running some simulations but my hunch is that you could cut the number of shafts by third without significantly impacting wait times if condominium complex with floors previously had elevators now it can run on which means an extra square feet of space per floor assuming shaft including the noise padding etc that ought to make any developer perk up
this is typical of japanese humor on television
fantastic site for anyone building web page or just editing template or online blog provides list of links to online resources
many useful links to online resources for web building whether you are building your own site or just editing template online blog etc
my counterargument is that we genuinely care about the former as well that we re interested in paul graham opinions because he paul graham and we trust his insight
along the same lines think pg credibility is affected by the fact that he got rich doing something he loves in some ways think someone who barely getting by doing what he loves would be more credible writing an essay like this do think his points are valid though
as somebody who is trying to learn chinese now for little more than one year have to say that using pinyin seemed to be big help to me however starting next month will give myself break and start writing characters more for the artistic side effect who knows maybe the whole learning process will benefit
emacs
do you mean to imply that wiretapping american citizens without even bothering to ask for warrant when it possible to do so after the fact isn absolutely ridiculous
that polar bear actions were clearly more rational than those of the participants creators of that show this may be the best argument for euthanisia ve seen
perhaps paul graham work on viaweb falls into the two job route insofar as it involves working on things he didn like for short intense burst to get money so he could work on things he did like
started on lisp when was and still in the grip of prestige but genuinely loved lisp hacking so it was mix acl was written for money but again loved the subject viaweb was done very consciously for money but we tried to avoid things we really hated like writing desktop software and in my case using ugly languages did some hard work at viaweb that probably wasn necessary some of the code wrote had tricks in it that wrote just to please myself wouldn do it again unless needed money again but if did need money probably start another startup that the most efficient way to get it
can you give me an example of specific paragraph in this essay that you feel is useless and could be deleted
that true at least it was supposed to be short remember telling someone when we started the company that thought if worked really hard could make million dollars in year in the end it took longer but paid more
like lot of paul graham articles but not all of them same thing for phil greenspun for some reason there have evolved bunch of drones who love to repost their links on blogs and aggregators like reddit since reddit doesn seem to have anything approaching product or it seems revenue perhaps it will end up being an excellent investment for advertising graham next book edited by product don mean the definition used by mbas or web entrepreneurs the combination of goods services goodwill intangibles and whatever else will get us acquired by google but instead more stodgy rule of thumb definition good or service that you can sell to customers then again perhaps reddit will released revised and more customizable or market segmented version useful for people who aren interested in articles on lisp or not as someone once wrote grace beats karma
there huge downside to impeaching and removing bush president cheney
love the snake oil graphic it not javascript it ajax
since reddit doesn seem to have anything approaching product and yet you use this non product
personally prefer the label above the field with colon at the end of the label to show the field below is the correct one that way your eye just moves straight down the page instead of zig zagging all over it and it looks cleaner too
factorial is useful for figuring out time or space requirements for instance if you needed to diff between files in search of some particular pattern that diff operations or if you re writing program that opens network connection between each combination of users that connections combinatorial statistics pops up all over the place but whether or not one actually cares about those numbers is typically matter of how performance sensitive your application is
guess what confusing for people like me and perhaps the op is how reddit will make money unlike the op not too concerned just hope the founders figure out way to earn cash so that can keep using it
apple they don need the software but they could use the patent portfolio and the already built infrastructure for updating guide data
think what you mean is that reddit doesn have any obvious source of income in vc speak it isn monetized as far as we can see suspect reddit business model primarily involves getting acquired by somebody with deep pockets and there nothing wrong with that
maybe because it solves problems you did not face before so your selective mind just did not notice the related keywords for example it has massive advantage over ruby python it is damn simple to embed and it is very small one of the main inspiration for io is lua which is somewhat becoming the de facto standard as an extension language think world of warcraft and it has somewhat big advantage over most languages by providing actor based concurrency which is really simple to reason about and is great boost over dumb shared state concurrency la pthread javathreads but most importantly io provides macro support which means you can morph it into whatever language you want but still retain the advantages of the platform and avoiding exp based environment which may be considered bad thing so think io may mostly appeal at first sight to people that already hit some wall while working with other similar languages still prefer ruby anyway
paul at one point you mention that any job no one really wants to do will go away much like servants for the rich have mostly dissapeared have question and statement for you why are people janitors there is little to no prestige it doesn pay well and pretty sure most people that do that job aren there for the love of it what makes you feel that servants for the rich are gone it seems to me that the job has just been bit more delgated most of the rich people know personally people that years ago would have had servants now have personal assistant maid cook masage therapist haridresser etc all of which come to their house to do things for them
this makes for an interesting question why didn paul just submit this himself would it be considered faux pas to submit one own orginal content
you misunderstood he meant you could overload the factorial function so that it has special case for each number you want to benchmark
presumably during the investigation cheney would be discraced as well and bush would have to get new vp and pull nixon giving us another ford not sure which would be worse bush or new ford
removed
suspect people become janitors because it stable job especially if you work for big company or school district there are still service jobs what gone in industrialized countries are the armies of live in servants if you want to see how different it was visit rich person house in poor country
gt perhaps it will end up being an excellent investment for advertising graham next book bought hackers and painters and was very disappointed not by the writing just that almost all the material is available on paul website hackers and painters is basically paulgraham com with hardcover and fancy jacket if paul releases another book won be buying it
well was barely getting by doing stuff loved for about five years before decided to solve the money problem once and for all also didn get rich doing something loved loved lisp hacking but that was only small fraction of viaweb
removed
paul seems everyone is addressing you directly here glad you avoided the old saw do what you love and the money will follow really can stand that saying it implies that doing what you love automatically leads to imense riches it very american kind of saying highly optimistic but not backed by any sort of empirical reality recently ve been hearing do what you love and the money won matter so much that seems to be make lot more sense and the flavor of this essay seems to agree with that modified version
hope not everyone feels like you because if they do book publishing is dead think people ought to post everything they publish online for free so everyone can read it and link to it it seems uncivilized not to if that idea spreads as it seems to be doing so far then every book will also be available online it would be great shame if that meant people stopped buying books wouldn still love physical books hope there are enough people who feel the same
if you read paulgraham com at all you know he mentions at the end of several essays that they appear in the book he not trying to pull fast one by hoping people won realize most of it free online until after they buy it some of us just prefer to read things away from computer and gasp have library thought amp was great and pretty confident ll buy his next book as well
more than likely fair portion of the agree respondents to the poll were thinking about sending message rather than actually wanting to see bush impeached think that most of the people who hate bush wouldn support an impeachment over this if it came down to actually doing it bush had the fortune of coming in after clinton who burned out lot of people on presidential scandals at this point people just expect anything having to do with bush to be like this situation we re in the midst of period of lowered expectations hopefully we re at or past the middle of it and not at the beginning so he ll get away with it it may have weakened him but only with few people that are interested and who had tentatively supported him before everyone else is either apathetic or has chosen their side and will stick with it regardless the jihadis are unswayed and the cynics are yawning call me when he gets blowjob from an intern
it appears that have to say list clone append to assign to new list so no
fair enough when first read the essay it seemed that you were saying that people only do job for love prestige or lots of money re reading it guess added the lots to the money myself
don think he set out to show anyone anything reading the page it sounds like he suffered from an eating disorder no irony no moral lesson just small human tragedy
don think people will stop buying books but books of essays or other collections are in trouble
think its interesting that so many people are worried about reddit business model in an ideal world this is because they are worried about one of their favorite websites going away in reality most of these people probably like to point out the lack of revenue to make them feel better about themselves and how they can run better business it is interesting to note that google did not have revenue model either until they caved and added ads two years after they started http www google com intl en corporate history html
for example this paragraph which route should you take take the two job route if you can stand the risk think it would do without the dots the omitted text as well

no ruby hasn grown passã but those of us who were learning ruby five years ago realize that now that ruby has grown popular it time to learn the next language so we don stagnate
think what find attractive about io only downloaded it few days ago and started playing with it bit then is the simplicity there is little or none at all syntax even assignment is method it has even deeper reflection capabilities than ruby you can access the ast in io and ve had need to do that in ruby but you have to resort to ripper or parsetree which are bit hackish multiple vms can run in the same application and the actor based concurrency model sounds interesting oh and io apparently has macros don get me wrong ruby is my favorite programming language so far so in no way dissing ruby it just time to learn new language and io looks like it has very nice feature set
knew it now have an excuse back to memorizing license plates
the main problem have from io right now just glancing at it is don think there are many books written on it there are no io books but some people think of that as challenge if you get into io now you can have greater influence than you could have over more established language like ruby or python at this point want to learn io because it looks kind fun the same reason learned ruby several years ago keep an eye on the early adopters they just might be finding the next ruby it might take years or so for it to show up on most radar screens though
none of these links seem to work
encouraging but this is plant with very highly talented employees that produces products whose broad production methods are already well established and understood the amp is thus gradual and incremental do the same thing with mediocre talent on projects that require developing entirely new processes of fabrication testing development etc and ll hail the revolution hopefully it more of cultural issue than something not humanly feasible
nope it was relatively recent http usa cricinfo com db stats tests partnerships html this whole set of records tends to be bit of bore beyond point scoring runs is it leaves too little time to get the other team out common pattern is that team will shoot for such records when batting second after their opponents have already put enough runs on the board that winning is well nigh impossible at least in this case the runs were scored at fast clip so there was entertainment to be had

hey have an idea let be just like digg com and stroke our egos by voting any story that has anythin at all to do with our site way the hell up because it really interesting no seriously not kidding why do you think being sarcastic love digg and especially love that one out of every two articles is about how awesome and big it is and how it going to take on slashdot we need to be just like that because it makes for great reading material want each and every one of you to go out right now and find every single story you can about reddit and submit it then the whole front page can be about reddit that would be totally radical to the maximum lt sarcasm gt
know it classic but for those who don know the history of the message in the road to serfdom it would have been better named the road to totalitarianism even in stalin ussr and hitler germany the rulers could come nowhere near to true serfdom the need for skilled labor kind of ruins the possibilty mean really can anyone see american slavery coming back because that pretty much what serfdom was minus the universal racist practices of course instead it was based on societal class

have noticed also that articles that present counterpoint to left wing anti capitalist anti bush anti religious anti google anit iraq war opinion also get modded down mercilessly of course understand why but worry that in the end reddit will only offer single point of view on anything diversity of opinion is important for thinking minds maybe reddit could have some kind of bottom page with the most down rated articles with some way to weed out spammers of course

find his am mathematician approach kind of annoying imo his analogy between learning new programming language and new mathematical field is wrong on so many levels judging from an earlier post he made today he still stuck on intro problems in baby rudin introductory real analysis book used for freshman honours courses at good schools so don think he has the experience yet to accurately make such analogies
